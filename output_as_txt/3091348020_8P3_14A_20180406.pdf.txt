77 RIO ROBLES, SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA 95134

PROPOSED MERGERS—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Class A Shareholders:

We cordially invite you to attend a special meeting of the holders (the “Shareholders”) of Class A shares representing limited partner interests (“Class A shares”) in 8point3 Energy
Partners LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Partnership”), to be held on May 23, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. (Pacific Time), at 77 Rio Robles, San Jose, California 95134 (the “Shareholder
Meeting”).    

On February 5, 2018, the Partnership entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Purchase Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with 8point3 General Partner, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and the general partner of the Partnership (the “General Partner”), 8point3 Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“OpCo” and, together
with the Partnership and the General Partner, the “Partnership Entities”), 8point3 Holding Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, 8point3 Solar CEI, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (“8point3 Solar”), 8point3 Co-Invest Feeder 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Investor Co 1”), 8point3 Co-Invest Feeder 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (“Investor Co 2”), CD Clean Energy and Infrastructure V JV (Holdco), LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“CD CEI V JV Holdco” and, together with 8point3 Solar,
Investor Co 1 and Investor Co 2, collectively, “Parent”), 8point3 Partnership Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of 8point3 Solar
(“Partnership Merger Sub”), 8point3 OpCo Merger Sub 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“OpCo Merger Sub 1”), and 8point3 OpCo
Merger Sub 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“OpCo Merger Sub 2” and, together with OpCo Merger Sub 1, the “OpCo Merger Subs”
and, the OpCo Merger Subs, together with Parent and Partnership Merger Sub, the “Parent Entities”).

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) OpCo Merger Sub 1 will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, merge with and into OpCo (“OpCo Merger 1”), with OpCo
surviving OpCo Merger 1, (ii) OpCo Merger Sub 2 will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, merge with and into OpCo (“OpCo Merger 2” and, together with OpCo Merger
1, the “OpCo Mergers”), with OpCo surviving OpCo Merger 2, and (iii) Partnership Merger Sub will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, merge with and into the Partnership
(the “Partnership Merger” and, together with the OpCo Mergers, the “Mergers”), with the Partnership surviving the Partnership Merger.

Upon the closing of the Transactions (as defined below), each issued and outstanding Class A share, each issued and outstanding common unit representing a limited liability company
interest in OpCo (“OpCo Common Unit”), other than the OpCo Common Units owned by the Partnership, and each issued and outstanding subordinated unit representing a limited liability
company interest in OpCo (“OpCo Subordinated Unit”) will represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $12.35 per share or unit, as applicable, and, in each case, without interest
and less any applicable withholding taxes, subject to adjustment at closing at a set daily rate representing cash expected to be generated between December 1, 2017 and closing less
distributions declared (to the extent the record date has passed prior to closing) or paid after January 12, 2018 and prior to closing (as further described in the attached proxy statement), and
each share or unit shall no longer be outstanding, automatically be canceled and cease to exist, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.

The conflicts committee (the “GP Conflicts Committee”) of the board of directors of the General Partner (the “General Partner Board”), consisting of three independent
directors, after consultation with its independent legal and financial advisors, has unanimously (i) determined that the Mergers, including the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby on the terms set forth therein (the “Transactions”), are advisable, fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, the Partnership Group (as
defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, dated as of June 24, 2015 (the “Partnership Agreement”)) and the holders of Class A shares of the
Partnership (other than the General Partner, First Solar, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“First Solar”), SunPower Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“SunPower” and, together
with First Solar, the “Sponsors”) and their affiliates) (the “Public Shareholders”), (ii) approved the Mergers, including the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, such approval
constituting “Special Approval” pursuant to Section 7.9(a) of the Partnership Agreement, (iii) recommended to the General Partner Board that the General Partner Board approve
the Mergers and consummate the Transactions on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement and (iv) recommended to the Public Shareholders that the Public Shareholders
approve the Merger Agreement and the Mergers.

The General Partner Board, based in part upon the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee, unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the General
Partner, the Partnership Group, the Shareholders and the holders of the OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units (the holders of such OpCo Common Units and OpCo
Subordinated Units, the “Unitholders”), and declared it advisable, for the Partnership Entities to enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the

Table of Contents

Mergers, (ii) approved the Mergers and the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the performance of the Transactions and (iii) recommended to the Shareholders
that the Shareholders approve the Merger Agreement and the Mergers.

The Partnership Merger requires, prior to the consummation thereof, the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the outstanding Class A shares (excluding Class A shares owned by the
General Partner or its affiliates), voting as a class, and (ii) a majority of the outstanding Class B shares representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (“Class B shares”), voting as a
class. Simultaneously with the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding Class A shares (excluding the Class A shares owned by the General Partner or its affiliates), the Partnership
will solicit a written consent from the Sponsors voting their Class B shares in favor of the Merger Agreement and the Partnership Merger. Additionally, the OpCo Mergers require, prior to the
consummation thereof, the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Common Units (excluding OpCo Common Units whose voting power is, with respect to the subject vote,
controlled by the General Partner or its affiliates, other than the Partnership, through ownership or otherwise), voting as a class, (ii) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Subordinated Units,
voting as a class (clauses (i) and (ii) together, a “Unit Majority”) and (iii) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Common Units, voting as a class. Immediately following the approval of the
OpCo Merger Proposal (as defined below), a written consent in favor of the OpCo Merger will be solicited from the Partnership, the Sponsors and their affiliates. You are being asked to
consider and vote on proposals to: (1) approve the Merger Agreement and the Partnership Merger (the “Partnership Merger Proposal”) and (2) direct the Partnership to vote its OpCo Common
Units in favor of the Merger Agreement and the OpCo Mergers (the “OpCo Merger Proposal” and, together with the Partnership Merger Proposal, the “Merger Proposals”). Each of the GP
Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board recommends that you vote “FOR” each of the Merger Proposals. The failure to submit a proxy or vote in person at the
Shareholder Meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” each of the Merger Proposals.

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Sponsors, who indirectly own 100.0% of the outstanding Class B shares, approximately 35.6% of the outstanding OpCo
Common Units and 100.0% of the outstanding OpCo Subordinated Units, have entered into a support agreement (the “Support Agreement”) with the Parent Entities. Under the Support
Agreement, the Sponsors have agreed, subject to the provisions thereof, to vote their Class B shares, OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units for the approval of the Merger
Agreement and the Mergers.

Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Shareholder Meeting, please complete, date, sign and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying prepaid reply envelope or submit your proxy by the Internet or telephone. If you attend the Shareholder Meeting and vote in person, your vote by ballot will revoke any proxy
previously submitted. Each of the Partnership Merger Proposal and the OpCo Merger Proposal is dependent on the other, and neither of them will be implemented unless they are both
approved at the Shareholder Meeting.

If your Class A shares are held in “street name” by your bank, broker or other nominee, your bank, broker or other nominee will be unable to vote your Class A shares without
instructions from you. You should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares in accordance with the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. The
failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares “FOR” the Merger Proposals will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposals.

The accompanying proxy statement provides you with detailed information about the Shareholder Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the Transactions. A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the entire proxy statement and its Annexes, including the Merger Agreement, carefully. Please read
“The Mergers—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Transactions. All information in this proxy
statement concerning the Partnership has been furnished by the Partnership. You may also obtain additional information about the Partnership from documents it has filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.

If you have any questions or need assistance voting your Class A shares, please contact Innisfree M&A Incorporated, the Partnership’s proxy solicitor, by calling toll-free at (877)
750-8338.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation and continued support.
 

 Sincerely,

 Charles D. Boynton

 
Chief Executive Officer of 8point3 General Partner, LLC,
the general partner of 8point3 Energy Partners LP

This proxy statement is dated April 6, 2018 and is first being mailed to Shareholders on or about April 11, 2018.

NEITHER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES REGULATORY AGENCY HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED
THE MERGERS, PASSED UPON THE MERITS OR FAIRNESS OF THE MERGERS OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THE DISCLOSURE IN
THIS DOCUMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

Recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board (see page 49)

The conflicts committee (the “GP Conflicts Committee”) of the board of directors of the General Partner (the “General Partner Board”),
consisting of three independent directors, considered the benefits of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby on the terms
set forth therein (the “Transactions”), as well as the associated risks, and, after consultation with its independent legal and financial advisors, by
unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and held on February 5, 2018, (i) determined that the Mergers, the Merger Agreement and the
Transactions, are advisable, fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, the Partnership Group (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) and
the holders of Class A shares (other than the General Partner, the Sponsors and their affiliates) (the “Public Shareholders”), (ii) approved the
Mergers, including the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, such approval constituting “Special Approval” pursuant to Section 7.9(a) of the
Partnership Agreement, (iii) recommended to the Board of Directors of the General Partner (the “General Partner Board”) that the General Partner
Board approve the Mergers and consummate the Transactions on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (iv) recommended to the Public
Shareholders that the Public Shareholders approve the Merger Agreement and the Mergers.

Taking into consideration such approval and recommendation, the General Partner Board, by unanimous vote at a meeting duly called and
held on February 5, 2018, (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the General Partner, the Partnership Group, the Shareholders and the
holders of OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units (such holders of OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units, the
“Unitholders”), and declared it advisable, for the Partnership Entities to enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the Mergers,

of (a) a Unit Majority and (b) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Common Units, voting as a class, in each case in accordance with the OpCo LLC
Agreement and the Partnership Agreement, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Mergers and (vi) determined to recommend
that the Shareholders approve the Merger Agreement and the Mergers.

Each of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board has unanimously approved, and recommends that you vote
“FOR,” the Partnership Merger Proposal and the OpCo Merger Proposal.

See “The Mergers—Recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board; Reasons for Recommending Approval
of the Merger Proposals.”

Opinion of the Financial Advisor to the GP Conflicts Committee (see page 55)

In connection with the proposed Partnership Merger, Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”) delivered a written opinion, dated February 5,
2018, to the GP Conflicts Committee as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the Share Merger
Consideration to the Partnership and the Public Shareholders. The full text of Evercore’s written opinion, dated February 5, 2018, to the GP
Conflicts Committee, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and qualifications on the
review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of Evercore’s opinion
set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Evercore’s opinion. Evercore’s opinion was prepared at
the request and for the benefit and use of the GP Conflicts Committee (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the
Share Merger Consideration from a financial point of view, and Evercore did not express any opinion on any other terms or aspects of the
Partnership Merger or any other matter. Evercore expressed no opinion as to the relative merits of the Partnership Merger or any other
transactions or business strategies discussed by the GP Conflicts Committee as alternatives to the Partnership Merger or the decision of
the GP Conflicts Committee to proceed with the Partnership Merger. Evercore’s opinion did not constitute and is not a recommendation to
the GP Conflicts Committee as to any action taken on any aspect of the Partnership Merger or any other matter. Neither Evercore’s
written opinion, nor the summary of such opinion and the related analyses set forth in this proxy statement are intended to be, and they do
not constitute, a recommendation as to how shareholders of the Partnership or any other person should act or vote with respect to the
Partnership Merger or any other matter.

See “The Mergers—Opinion of the GP Conflicts Committee’s Financial Advisor.”

Interests of Certain Persons in the Mergers (see page 66)

In considering the recommendations of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board with respect to the Merger Agreement
and the Mergers, the Shareholders should be aware that certain of the current directors and executive officers of the General Partner and their
affiliates have interests in the Mergers that differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of the Shareholders generally. The Shareholders should
take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the Merger Proposals.

These arrangements are more fully described under “The Mergers—Interests of Certain Persons in the Mergers.”

Interests of the Sponsors

The Sponsors have a significant interest in the Partnership and OpCo through their collective indirect ownership of 100.0% of the Class B
shares, approximately 35.6% of the OpCo Common Units and 100% of the OpCo Subordinated Units. First Solar owns 6,721,810 OpCo Common
Units and 15,395,115 OpCo Subordinated

Units, all of which will be canceled upon the Closing and converted into the right to receive the Unit Merger Consideration. SunPower owns
8,778,190 OpCo Common Units and 20,104,884 OpCo Subordinated Units, all of which will be canceled upon the Closing and represent the right
to receive the Unit Merger Consideration. Additionally, each of First Solar and SunPower owns a 50% voting and economic interest in Holdings,
which owns 100% of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in the General Partner, including all rights and obligations
relating thereto and all economic and capital interests therein (the “General Partner Interest”), and the IDRs in OpCo. The Sponsors are transferring
their ownership of the General Partner Interest and the IDRS for no consideration.

Beginning after November 30, 2019, the economic interests of Holdings owned by the Sponsors will be subject to adjustment annually based
on the performance of the Partnership’s subsidiary project entities and any additional assets contributed to OpCo by such Sponsor against the
performance of all the Partnership’s subsidiary project entities and all additional assets held by OpCo. The percentage of the aggregate economic
interests held by each Sponsor after adjustment will equal the percentage arrived at by dividing (i) the cash generated and distributed, subject to
certain exclusions, by one Sponsor’s project entities and any additional assets contributed by such Sponsor to OpCo prior to the end of the most
recent fiscal year, by (ii) the cash generated and distributed, subject to certain exclusions, by both Sponsors’ project entities and any additional
assets contributed by the Sponsors to OpCo prior to the end of the most recent fiscal year. In addition, after November 30, 2019, payments on the
economic interests are subject to an annual reallocation among the Sponsors based on the relative performance of the assets contributed by each
Sponsor compared to the projected performance of such assets at the time of contribution.

The Sponsors agreed on a division of proceeds between them from the sale of the Partnership Entities or any of the Sponsors’ interests
therein. Such division of proceeds was the result of negotiation regarding the consideration required by SunPower for agreeing to enter into such
transaction. Such negotiations focused on the provisions of the limited liability company agreements of Holdings and the General Partner related to
the consent rights of SunPower related to the proposed transactions. Pursuant to a separate agreement to effectuate the foregoing, First Solar has
agreed to pay SunPower additional consideration from the proceeds received at the Closing. As a result of such agreement, based on an unadjusted
Unit Merger Consideration, First Solar will receive an aggregate of approximately $242.8 million (or $10.98 per OpCo Unit) and SunPower will
receive an aggregate of approximately $387.1 million (or $13.40 per OpCo Unit).

Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each of the Sponsors and their affiliates will be fully released from providing
certain indemnification and credit support obligations. The Merger Agreement also provides that, upon the effectiveness of OpCo Merger 1, OpCo
(continuing as the surviving entity) will repay the loan incurred from First Solar in connection with the Partnership’s acquisition of the Stateline
Project in California as further described in this proxy statement.

Interests of Certain Directors and Officers of the General Partner

Certain directors of the General Partner Board are designees and employees of the Sponsors, and certain executive officers of the General
Partner are also executive officers of the Sponsors. Directors and officers who are also employees of the Sponsors are expected to continue their
employment with the Sponsors, and no director or officer of the General Partner will be entitled to severance payments or benefits, change of
control payments or golden parachute compensation in connection with the Transactions. Those directors and officers holding Class A shares will
receive the same Share Merger Consideration as the Shareholders, in exchange for such shares, upon the effectiveness of the Partnership Merger.

The members of the GP Conflicts Committee did not receive any additional compensation for their participation with the transaction process.

reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement and, in no event later than ten (10) business days, file the notifications required
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (“HSR Act”). While a filing under the HSR Act is contemplated as

HSR Act is not required.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Holdings, the Partnership and Parent agreed to, (i) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement, prepare and, in no event later than ten (10) business days after the date of the
Merger Agreement, submit an application for approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under Section 203 of the

things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the approval from FERC so as to be able to consummate and make effective the Transactions,
including taking all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the FERC may assert under applicable law
(including the FPA) with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later
than the Outside Date (as defined below)). The Partnership submitted an application for approval to FERC on February 21, 2018.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, each party agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain approval
from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and each member agency thereof acting in such capacity (“CFIUS”), including
(i) exercising reasonable best efforts to promptly (and not later than fifteen (15) business days after the date of the Merger Agreement, unless

Partnership Entities (collectively, the “Representatives”) not to:
 

 

•  initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by providing information; provided that any communication undertaken by the
Partnership Entities or Holdings in the ordinary course of business and not related, directly or indirectly, to an Alternative Proposal (as
defined below under “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation”) or the Mergers or any other
similar transaction shall not, in and of itself be deemed an action by the Partnership Entities or Holdings to encourage) any inquiries,

•  take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Laws inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by any Alternative

Proposal; or
 

 •  resolve or publicly propose or announce to do any of the foregoing (subject to the exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement).

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, the Partnership and Holdings may
furnish information, provide access to certain information, engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with any third party making a Bona
Fide Alternative Proposal (as defined below under “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation”) received after
the date of the Merger Agreement, so long as:
 

 

•  the General Partner Board (after due consideration of the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee) determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside financial and legal advisors) that the Bona Fide Alternative Proposal constitutes or may reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below under “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation or Withdrawal of
Recommendation”);

 

 
•  such third party has executed a customary confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in that certain

Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2017 by and among First Solar, SunPower, the Partnership and Capital Dynamics
Limited, a Delaware corporation; and

 

 
•  the Partnership and Holdings provides or makes available to Parent any material non-public information provided to such third party,

which was not previously provided or made available to Parent.

No Withdrawal of Recommendation

The Merger Agreement provides that, other than in certain specified situations, neither the General Partner Board nor the GP Conflicts
Committee may (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Parent Entities the Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Board Recommendation in this proxy statement
distributed to the Shareholders in connection with the Transactions, or (iv) resolve or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any of such
actions, an “Adverse Recommendation Change”).

The General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee, as applicable, will be entitled to effect, or cause the Partnership Entities to effect,
an Adverse Recommendation Change or authorize the termination of the Merger Agreement in connection with a Superior Proposal only if:
 

 
•  the Partnership notifies Parent in writing at least three (3) business days before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies

the reasons therefor, including, if applicable, the identity of the person making the Alternative Proposal;

•  to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, the Partnership has negotiated in good faith with Parent during such three (3) business day
period, to enable Parent to effect revisions to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement that would, if a Superior Proposal has
been made, cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or, in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change, it would cause the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee to no longer believe that making an
Adverse Recommendation Change would be in, or not adverse to, the best interests of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders
or would otherwise be consistent with their duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable law; and

 

 

•  Parent makes a proposal during such three-business day period to adjust the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the General
Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee, as applicable, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement as proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal
advisors, that such Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal, if applicable, and that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate the Merger Agreement, as applicable, could be adverse to the interests of the Partnership Group
or Public Shareholders or would otherwise be inconsistent with their duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable law.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (see page 96)

The parties to the Merger Agreement can mutually agree to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time without completing the Mergers. In
addition, the General Partner, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, may terminate the Merger Agreement on their own without completing
the Mergers in a number of situations, including if:
 

 

•  subject to certain exceptions, the Mergers have not been consummated on or before August 6, 2018, subject to extension by either party
to no later than November 5, 2018 in certain circumstances as specified in the Merger Agreement (the “Outside Date”) (so long as the
party seeking to terminate did not prevent the Mergers from occurring by failing to perform or observe its obligations under the Merger
Agreement);

 

 
•  any law or order is enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended or enforced by any Governmental Authority is in effect and has

become final and nonappealable enjoining, restraining, preventing or prohibiting consummation of any of the Transactions;
 

 •  after final adjournment of the Shareholder Meeting, Shareholder Approval has not been obtained;
 

 

•  the other parties breach any of their respective representations or warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement or fail to perform any of
their respective covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth under “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Mergers” relating to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of such party or the performance of such party of its obligations and (ii) is incapable of being cured or is
not cured by the earlier of the Outside Date and the date that is thirty (30) days after such breach or failure;

 

 
•  the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee has made and not withdrawn an Adverse Recommendation Change (whether

or not in compliance with the Merger Agreement); provided, that Parent may only terminate the Merger Agreement prior to the final
adjournment of the Shareholder Meeting at which a vote of the Shareholders is taken in accordance with the Merger Agreement;

 

 

•  the General Partner Board authorizes the Partnership Entities, to the extent permitted by and subject to complying with the terms of the
Merger Agreement, to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and, concurrently with the
termination of the Merger Agreement, the Partnership Entities, subject to complying with the terms of the Merger Agreement, enter into
an alternative acquisition agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, subject to payment of the Termination Fee (as defined below) to

Agreement.”

Termination Fees and Expenses (see page 98)

If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated, then, except as described below, each of the parties will be relieved of its duties and
obligations and such termination will be without liability to either party. The Merger Agreement contains various amounts payable under the
circumstances described below:
 

 
•  if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to an authorization by the General Partner Board for the Partnership Entities to enter into an

alternative acquisition agreement to consummate a Superior Proposal and the Partnership Entities’ concurrent entry into such an
alternative acquisition agreement, then OpCo shall pay Parent approximately $24.7 million (the “Termination Fee”);

 

 
•  if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent after the General Partner Board or GP Conflicts Committee has made and not

withdrawn an Adverse Recommendation Change prior to the final adjournment of the Shareholder Meeting, then OpCo shall pay Parent
the Termination Fee; and

Table of Contents

 

•  if, despite the satisfaction of all of the closing conditions under the Merger Agreement, the Closing has not occurred by the required
time and, despite the General Partner’s delivery to Parent by irrevocable written notice of confirmation that all closing conditions have
been and remain satisfied and each of the Partnership Entities remain ready, willing and able to consummate the Transactions to effect
the Closing, but Parent fails to effect the Closing by the tenth business day following the delivery of such notice or one day prior to the
Outside Date, as applicable, then Parent shall pay the Partnership approximately $54.3 million (the “Parent Termination Fee”).

If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including the following, OpCo shall reimburse Parent for all documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent and its affiliates in connection with the Transactions (up to $8,000,000):
 

 
•  if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent by written notice after the Outside Date (for any reason other than the failure to obtain

one or more regulatory approval(s) from the relevant Governmental Authority);
 

 
•  if, after the final adjournment of the Shareholder Meeting at which a vote of the Shareholders has been taken in accordance with the

Merger Agreement, the Shareholder Approval has not been obtained, and the Merger Agreement is terminated by the General Partner or
Parent;

 

 

•  if any Partnership Entity or Holdings has breached any of its respective representations or warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement
or failed to perform any of its respective covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which breach or failure to
perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a closing condition relating to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Partnership Entities or the performance of the Partnership Entities and Holdings of obligations and (ii) is incapable of being cured or is
not cured by the earlier of the Outside Date and the date that is thirty (30) days after such breach or failure; or

 

 

•  if, despite the satisfaction of all of the closing conditions under the Merger Agreement, the Closing has not occurred by the required
time and, despite Parent’s delivery to the General Partner by irrevocable written notice of confirmation that all closing conditions have
been and remain satisfied and each of the Parent Entities remains ready, willing and able to consummate the Transactions to effect the
Closing, but the General Partner fails to effect the Closing by the tenth business day following the delivery of such notice or one day
prior to the Outside Date, as applicable.

If the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent or the General Partner pursuant to a written notice to the other party at any time after the
Outside Date, the Closing has not been consummated by such date, and none of the closing conditions under the Merger Agreement (other than
obtaining CFIUS Approval) has failed or is unable to be satisfied if the Merger Agreement were not terminated, or an injunction or restraint
relating to obtaining CFIUS Approval has been effected, then Parent shall reimburse OpCo for all documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Sponsors or the Partnership Entities in connection with the Transactions (up to $6,000,000).

Concurrently with the execution the Merger Agreement, 8point3 Solar, OpCo, the Partnership and the Bank of New York Mellon, a New
York banking corporation (the “Escrow Agent”), entered into an escrow agreement establishing an escrow account in support of the potential
obligation of Parent to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to the terms above, and 8point3 Solar deposited into the Escrow Account an
amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee. At the Closing, each of 8point3 Solar, the Partnership and OpCo shall deliver a notice to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to disburse all of the funds held in the escrow account on the Closing Date.

Market Price of and Distributions on the Class A Shares (see page 102)

On January 12, 2018, OpCo distributed an aggregate of $22.2 million to the holders of the OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated
Units, and the Partnership, in turn, distributed an aggregate of $7.9 million that it received from OpCo’s distribution to the holders of its Class A
shares, or, in each case, $0.2802 per share or unit for the period from September 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017. Although the Partnership
Agreement requires that the Partnership distribute its available cash each quarter, and the OpCo LLC Agreement requires OpCo to distribute its
available cash each quarter, neither the Partnership nor OpCo has a legal obligation to distribute any particular amount per Class A Share or per
OpCo unit. During the pendency of the Transactions, the Partnership and OpCo intend to make quarterly distributions of $0.2802 per share, which
maintains the distribution level at the end of fiscal year 2017. On March 22, 2018, the General Partner Board declared a cash distribution for the
Class A shares of $0.2802 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which will be paid April 13, 2018 to Shareholders of record as of April 3, 2018.

For more information, see “Market Price of and Distributions on the Class A Shares.”

The Support Agreement (see page 101)

On February 5, 2018, the Sponsors entered into a support agreement with the Parent Entities (the “Support Agreement”), pursuant to which
each Sponsor agreed to vote its indirectly owned (i) Class B shares (the “Owned Shares”), (ii) OpCo Common Units, which collectively constitute
approximately 35.6% of the outstanding OpCo Common Units (the “Owned OpCo Units”) and (iii) Subordinated Units, which collectively
represent 100% of the outstanding OpCo Subordinated Units (the “Owned Subordinated Units,” together with the Owned Shares and Owned OpCo
Units, the “Sponsor Units”) for approval of the Merger Agreement and any related proposal necessary or desirable for the consummation of the
Transactions (including the Mergers) and against any alternative proposal, including any Superior Proposal.

For more information, see “The Support Agreement.”

Financing of the Mergers (see page 70)

Parent expects to fund the Mergers through (i) debt financing that has been committed to Parent by The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, UFJ, Ltd
(“MUFG”), Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (“Mass Mutual”), Key Bank National Association (“Key Bank”) and Commonwealth
Bank of Australia (“CBA” and collectively with MUFG, Mass Mutual and Key Bank, the “Lenders”) and (ii) committed equity financing available
to the following investment vehicles managed by CDI: CD CEI V, Co-Invest Holdco 1 and Co-Invest Holdco 2 (collectively, the “Equity
Investors”). The Merger Agreement does not contain a financing condition and if the debt financing or equity financing funds are not obtained,
Parent shall continue to be obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to
consummate the Transactions (provided that the Partnership may not seek specific performance in the event of Parent’s failure to consummate the
Transactions due to the failure to obtain the debt financing, in which case Parent would be obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee). The
funding of the debt financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the commitment letters pursuant to which the debt financing
will be provided. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Parent has agreed, among other things, to take all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the equity financing, and to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the debt financing.

See “The Mergers—Financing of the Mergers.”

Accounting Treatment (see page 72)

The Mergers qualify as business combinations and the Transactions will be accounted for using the acquisition method.

See “The Mergers—Accounting Treatment.”

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations (see page 68)

The receipt of the Share Merger Consideration in the Partnership Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. In general, the Partnership Merger will be treated as a taxable sale of a U.S. holder’s Class A shares in exchange for the Share Merger
Consideration.

A U.S. holder who receives the Share Merger Consideration in the Partnership Merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Class A shares exchanged therefor.

Such gain or loss will generally be taxable as capital gain or loss. Capital gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder will generally be long-term
capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held its Class A shares for more than one year as of the closing of the Partnership Merger. Non-corporate
U.S. holders are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation on long-term capital gains. Capital losses recognized by a U.S. holder may offset
capital gains and, in the case of individuals, offset no more than $3,000 of ordinary income. Capital losses recognized by U.S. holders that are
corporations may only be used to offset capital gains.

The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Partnership Merger to a U.S. holder will depend on such U.S. holder’s own personal tax
situation. Accordingly, the Partnership strongly urges you to consult your tax advisor for a full understanding of the particular tax
consequences of the Partnership Merger to you.

The Transactions (other than the Partnership Merger) are not taxable events with respect to U.S. holders of Class A shares and will have no
U.S. federal income tax consequences for such holders.

See “The Mergers—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a more complete discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Mergers.

No Dissenters’ or Appraisal Rights (see page 72)

Under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, as amended, and the Partnership Agreement, there are no dissenters’ or
appraisal rights for the Public Shareholders with respect to the Transactions.

See “The Mergers—No Dissenters’ or Appraisal Rights.”

Litigation (see page 72)

In connection with the Mergers, purported Shareholders have filed lawsuits against the Partnership and the members of the General Partner
Board. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Transactions. The Partnership believes that these complaints are without merit. The
Partnership cannot predict the outcome of or estimate the possible loss or range of loss from these matters.

For more information, see “The Mergers—Litigation.”

Delisting and Deregistration of Class A Shares (see page 73)

If the Transactions are completed, the Class A shares will be delisted from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (via termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act). After the Closing, the
Partnership will also file a Form 15 to suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Partnership will
no longer be obligated to file any periodic reports or other reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on account of the Class A
shares.

See “The Mergers—Delisting and Deregistration of Class A Shares.”

the Partnership to vote its common units representing limited liability company interests in OpCo (as defined below) (“OpCo Common Units”) in
favor of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on the terms set forth therein (the “Transactions”).

On February 5, 2018, the Partnership entered into the Merger Agreement with 8point3 General Partner, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and the general partner of the Partnership (the “General Partner”), 8point3 Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability

Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of 8point3 Solar (“Partnership Merger Sub”), 8point3 OpCo Merger Sub 1,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“OpCo Merger Sub 1”), and 8point3 OpCo Merger Sub 2,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“OpCo Merger Sub 2” and, together with OpCo Merger Sub

limited liability company of OpCo Merger 2 (the “Surviving LLC”), (iii) Partnership Merger Sub will merge with and into the Partnership (the

Table of Contents

“Surviving Partnership” and, together with the Surviving LLC, the “Surviving Entities”), (iv) Holdings will transfer to 8point3 Solar or an affiliate
of 8point3 Solar designated by 8point3 Solar, and 8point3 Solar (or its designated affiliate) will accept, for no consideration, the transfer and
delivery of, 100% of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in the General Partner, including all rights and obligations
relating thereto and all economic and capital interests therein (the “General Partner Interest”) and 100% of the issued and outstanding Incentive
Distribution Rights (as defined in that certain Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of OpCo, dated June 24, 2015 (the
“OpCo LLC Agreement”)) (the “IDRs”) (such transfers, the “Equity Transfers”).

As a result of the Transactions, the Partnership will no longer be a publicly traded limited partnership, and you, as a Shareholder, will no longer
have any interest in the Partnership’s future earnings or growth. In addition, upon completion of the Mergers, the Class A shares will be delisted
from the NASDAQ Global Select Market (the “NASDAQ”) and will be subsequently deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the Partnership will no longer file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”). You are being asked to consider and vote on two proposals: (1) to approve the Merger Agreement and the Partnership Merger (the
“Partnership Merger Proposal”), and (2) to direct the Partnership to vote, by written consent or at a meeting of the holders of OpCo Common
Units and subordinated units representing limited liability company interests in OpCo (“OpCo Subordinated Units” and, together with the OpCo
Common Units, the “OpCo Units”), its OpCo Common Units in favor of the Merger Agreement and the OpCo Mergers (the “OpCo Merger
Proposal” and, together with the Partnership Merger Proposal, the “Merger Proposals”).

See “Information about the Shareholder Meeting and Voting.”

 
Q: What will I, as a Shareholder, receive if the Mergers are completed?
 

A: Upon the effectiveness of the Partnership Merger, each Shareholder will receive $12.35 per Class A share in cash, without interest, less any
applicable withholding taxes and as adjusted pursuant to the following sentence (the “Share Merger Consideration”). The final price would be
adjusted upward for cash generated from December 1, 2017 through closing of the Mergers (the “Closing”) based off the expected daily cash flow
accrual applicable for the quarter and downward for the amount of distributions declared (to the extent the record date has passed prior to the
Closing) or paid prior to the Closing. Depending on the date of Closing (the “Closing Date”), each Shareholder may receive more or less than
$12.35 per Class A share pursuant to the Partnership Merger. Assuming a Closing Date of May 24, 2018, each Shareholder will receive $12.3833
per Class A share.

See “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.”

 
Q: What will First Solar, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“First Solar”), and SunPower Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“SunPower”

and, together with First Solar, the “Sponsors”) receive if the Mergers are completed?
 

A: At or immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Mergers, the Sponsors will receive $12.35 per issued and outstanding OpCo Common Unit and
OpCo Subordinated Unit, in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes and as adjusted pursuant to the following sentence
(the “Unit Merger Consideration” and, together with the Share Merger Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). The final price would be
adjusted upward for cash generated from December 1, 2017 through the Closing based off the expected daily cash flow accrual applicable for the
quarter and downward for the amount of distributions declared (to the extent that the record date has passed prior to the Closing) or paid prior to
the Closing. As consideration required by SunPower for agreeing to enter into the Transactions, the Sponsors have agreed that First Solar would
pay SunPower additional consideration from the proceeds it receives at the Closing. As a result of such agreement, based on an unadjusted Unit
Merger Consideration, First Solar will receive an aggregate of approximately $242.8 million (or $10.98 per OpCo Unit) and SunPower will
receive an aggregate of approximately $387.1 million (or $13.40 per OpCo Unit).

Q: Will the Partnership continue to pay quarterly distributions pending the Closing of the Partnership Merger?
 

A: The Transactions are targeted to close in the second fiscal quarter of 2018 and are subject to the right that each of the General Partner and Parent
has to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Transactions have not been consummated on or before August 6, 2018, subject to extension by either
party to no later than November 5, 2018 in certain circumstances as specified in the Merger Agreement (the “Outside Date”).

Until the completion of the Transactions, the Partnership plans to declare and pay quarterly distributions of $0.2802 per share in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practices. On March 22, 2018, the General Partner Board declared a cash distribution for the Class A
shares of $0.2802 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which will be paid April 13, 2018 to Shareholders of record as of April 3, 2018.

See “Market Price of and Distributions on the Class A shares.”

 
Q: How does each of the Conflicts Committee of the General Partner Board (the “GP Conflicts Committee”) and the General Partner Board

recommend that I vote?
 

A: Each of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board recommends that the Shareholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposals.

 
Q: Why does each of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board recommend that I vote “FOR” the Merger Proposals?
 

A: The GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board considered a number of factors in making their recommendations to the Shareholders.
The factors considered by the GP Conflicts Committee to be generally positive or favorable include, but are not limited to the following:

 

 

•  The Share Merger Consideration is an all-cash amount, which the GP Conflicts Committee believed provided greater value to the holders of
Class A shares (other than the General Partner, the Sponsors and their affiliates) (the “Public Shareholders”) than the long-term value of the
Partnership as a publicly traded partnership, after taking into account the risks and challenges facing the Partnership’s current business and
financial prospects;

 

 
•  The GP Conflicts Committee believed that neither Sponsor would be willing to lower the consideration it receives in the Transactions to

benefit the Shareholders;
 

 •  The Sponsors are transferring their General Partner Interest and their IDRs for no consideration;
 

 
•  The fact that the Mergers resulted from a comprehensive process in which the Sponsors and the Partnership contacted or received inbound

interest from over 130 prospective buyers over approximately nine months and entered into non-disclosure agreements with more than 30
prospective buyers;

 

 

•  Receipt by the GP Conflicts Committee of the opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C., its financial advisor (“Evercore”), on February 5, 2018,
that, as of such date and based on and subject to the assumptions, procedures, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in the
opinion, the Share Merger Consideration to be paid by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to
the Partnership and the Public Shareholders;

 

 

•  The GP Conflicts Committee believed that the Partnership would face significant challenges were it to continue as a public standalone
company, including, but not limited to: that the Partnership may need to refinance its non-amortizing debt due in 2020, or before 2020, with
amortizing debt which would likely reduce cash available for distribution; that the Partnership’s growth prospects would be extremely
limited; that it would be challenging to finance the acquisition of additional projects given its current share price and debt levels, the rising
interest rate environment and restrictions on its business, including restrictions resulting from its debt obligations;

•  The terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement were determined through extensive arm’s-length negotiations among the Sponsors, the
Partnership, the GP Conflicts Committee, and CD Clean Energy Infrastructure V JV, LLC (“Capital Dynamics”), an investment vehicle
managed by Capital Dynamics, Inc., which is an independent global asset manager, investing in private equity, private credit and clean
energy infrastructure (“CDI”), on behalf of Parent and their respective representatives and advisors;

 

 
•  Certain terms of the Merger Agreement and the related agreements support the GP Conflicts Committee’s belief that it is fair and reasonable

to, and in the best interest of, the Partnership and the Public Shareholders for the Partnership to enter into the Merger Agreement and
consummate the Transactions; and

 

 
•  The Transactions being subject to the approval of a majority of the outstanding Class A shares (excluding Class A shares owned by the

General Partner or its affiliates), voting as a class.

For a full list of the factors, including a list of negative factors, considered by the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board, see
“The Mergers—Recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board; Reasons for Recommending Approval of the
Merger Proposals.”

 
Q: When do you expect the Transactions to be completed?
 

A: Assuming timely satisfaction of other closing conditions, including Shareholder Approval of the Merger Proposals, the Transactions are targeted
to close in the second fiscal quarter of 2018.

 
Q: What if the Transactions are not completed?
 

A: If the Merger Proposals are not approved by the Shareholders or if the Transactions are not completed for any other reason, you will not receive
any consideration for your Class A shares in connection with the Transactions. Instead, the Partnership will remain a publicly traded limited
partnership, and the Class A shares will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ. Remaining as a publicly traded limited partnership
could result in certain challenges including, among other things, a risk that the Partnership may need to refinance its non-amortizing debt due in or
before 2020 with amortizing debt, which would likely reduce cash available for distribution, limit growth and acquisition prospects and limit
ability to raise debt on suitable terms. Additionally, the subordination period of the OpCo Subordinated Units is expected to terminate in October
2018, at which time all OpCo Subordinated Units will convert into OpCo Common Units. Upon the termination of the subordination period, the
provisions of the Partnership Agreement (as defined below) provide that all Class A shares and Class B shares (as defined below) vote together as
a class on proposals such as the Partnership Merger Proposal and the provisions of the OpCo LLC Agreement provide that all OpCo Common
Units, including the newly converted units, vote together as a class on proposals such as the OpCo Merger Proposal.

 
Q: What conditions must be satisfied to complete the Transactions?
 

A: Under the Merger Agreement, the respective obligations of each party to effect the Transactions is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number
of conditions, including, among others: (i) in accordance with the applicable requirements set forth in the Partnership’s Amended and Restated
Agreement of Limited Partnership, dated as of June 24, 2015 (the “Partnership Agreement”), and the OpCo LLC Agreement, receipt of the
affirmative vote of (a) a majority of the outstanding Class A Shares (excluding Class A shares owned by the General Partner or its affiliates),
voting as a class, (b) a majority of the outstanding Class B shares representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (“Class B shares”),
voting as a class (clauses (a) and (b) together, the “Shareholder Approval”), (c) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Common Units (excluding
OpCo Common Units whose voting power is, with respect to the subject vote, controlled by the General Partner or its affiliates, other than the
Partnership, through ownership or otherwise), voting as a

class, (d) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Subordinated Units, voting as a class (clauses (c) and (d) together, a “Unit Majority”) and (e) a
majority of the outstanding OpCo Common Units, voting as a class (clauses (c) through (e) together, the “Unitholder Approval”), (ii) expiration or
termination of the waiting period applicable to the Transactions under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended
(“HSR Act”), (iii) approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has been obtained, (iv) approval (“CFIUS Approval”)
from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and each member agency thereof acting in such capacity (“CFIUS”) has been
obtained, (v) the absence of certain legal impediments to the consummation of the Transactions, (vi) all required consents have been obtained,
(vii) the accuracy of the parties’ representations and warranties, (viii) the performance of the parties’ obligations under the Merger Agreement,
(ix) nothing has occurred that has a material adverse effect on the ability of any Partnership Entity or Holdings to consummate the Transactions or
perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement, (x) the Parent Entities shall have received payoff letters, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent Entities with respect to the indebtedness of the Partnership, OpCo and subsidiaries of OpCo (the “Partnership Group
Entities”), (xi) the termination or release of all guarantees of, and liens securing, such indebtedness of the Partnership Group Entities and the
assignment or replacement of all outstanding letters of credit specified in the Merger Agreement, and (xii) the replacement of certain credit
obligations of the Sponsors by the Parent Entities. While a filing under the HSR Act is contemplated as a condition under the Merger Agreement,
after further analysis, Holdings, the Partnership and Parent concluded and agreed that filing under the HSR Act is not required.

For a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Transactions, see “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to the Mergers.”

 
Q: What happens if a third party makes an offer to acquire the Partnership before the Transactions are consummated?
 

A: Under the Merger Agreement, prior to obtaining Shareholder Approval, the Partnership and Holdings may (i) in response to a bona fide alternative
proposal (as defined below under “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation”) received after the date of the
Merger Agreement and (ii) which the General Partner Board (after due consideration of the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee)
determines in good faith constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below under “The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation”), (1) furnish information with respect to the General Partner and the Partnership
Group Entities and certain non-controlled entities in which the Partnership owns an interest to the person making such alternative proposal
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in the confidentiality agreement with Capital
Dynamics Limited and (2) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with such person and its Representatives (as defined below under
“The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation”) regarding such alternative proposal, so long as the Partnership
and Holdings disclose to Parent any material non-public information provided which was not previously provided or made available to Parent. If,
after considering the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee, the General Partner Board determines that such alternative proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the consummation of the Mergers is not in the best interests of the Partnership, then subject to the terms of
the Merger Agreement, the Partnership may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.

If the Merger Agreement is terminated by (i) the General Partner due to the General Partner Board authorizing the Partnership Entities to enter
into an alternative acquisition agreement and, concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Partnership Entities enter into an
alternative acquisition agreement or (ii) by Parent because the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee has made and not withdrawn
an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined below under “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation”)
prior to the final adjournment of the Shareholder Meeting, a termination fee of approximately $24.7 million (the “Termination Fee”) is payable by
OpCo to Parent.

Q: What is the record date for the Shareholder Meeting?
 

A: The record date for the Shareholder Meeting is April 6, 2018. Only Shareholders at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, the Shareholder Meeting.

See “Information about the Shareholder Meeting and Voting.”

 
Q: How are votes counted?
 

A: Approval of the Merger Proposals requires the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding Class A shares (excluding Class A shares
owned by the General Partner or its affiliates) on the record date. For the Merger Proposals, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN.”
Abstentions will count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present but will be counted as a vote cast “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposals. If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your Class A shares will not be voted on any proposal on which your broker
does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is referred to in this proxy statement and in general as a broker non-vote. In these cases, the
broker can register your Class A shares as being present at the Shareholder Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be able to
vote on those matters for which specific authorization is required. Brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on the Merger Proposals and
a broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposals. If you fail to submit a proxy or to vote in person at the
Shareholder Meeting, your Class A shares will not count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present and, like a broker non-vote
(if any) or an abstention, will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the Merger Proposals.

If you own Class A shares that are directly registered in your name and return a signed proxy card or submit your proxy via the Internet or by
telephone but do not indicate how you wish your Class A shares to be voted, the Class A shares represented by your properly submitted proxy will
be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposals.

See “Information about the Shareholder Meeting and Voting.”

 
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Shareholder Meeting?
 

A: The preliminary voting results are expected to be announced at the Shareholder Meeting. In addition, within four (4) business days following
certification of the final voting results, the Partnership intends to file the final voting results with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.

 
Q: What is the difference between a holder of record of Class A shares and a beneficial owner of Class A shares?
 

A: If your Class A shares are registered directly in your name with the transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered the
shareholder of record with respect to those Class A shares. As the shareholder of record, you have the right to vote by granting your voting rights
directly to the Partnership or to a third party or by voting in person at the meeting.

If your Class A shares are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of Class A shares held in “street
name,” and your bank, broker or other nominee is considered the shareholder of record with respect to those Class A shares. Your bank, broker or
other nominee should send you, as the beneficial owner, a package describing the procedure for voting your Class A shares. You should follow the
instructions provided by them to vote your Class A shares. You are invited to attend the Shareholder Meeting; however, you may not vote your
Class A shares in person at the meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker, or other nominee that holds your Class A shares,
giving you the right to vote the Class A shares at the meeting.

Table of Contents

Q: If my Class A shares are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other nominee, will my bank, broker or other nominee vote my
Class A shares for me?

 

A: Your bank, broker or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your Class A shares if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to
vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or other nominee regarding the voting of your Class A shares. Banks,
brokers or other nominees who hold Class A shares in “street name” for customers have the authority to vote on “routine” proposals when they
have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokers and other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting
discretion with respect to approving non-routine matters, such as the Merger Proposals, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from the
beneficial owner of such Class A shares, banks, brokers or other nominees are not empowered to vote those Class A shares on such non-routine
matters. If you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your Class A shares, your Class A shares will not be voted, and this will
have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the Merger Proposals.

 
Q: How many votes do I have?
 

A: You are entitled to one vote for each Class A share owned by you as of the record date, April 6, 2018. As of close of business on April 6, 2018,
there were 28,093,305 outstanding Class A shares.

 
Q: What constitutes a quorum for the Shareholder Meeting?
 

A: The presence, in person or by proxy, at the Shareholder Meeting of holders of a majority of the outstanding Class A shares as of the close of
business on the record date will constitute a quorum for the Shareholder Meeting and will permit the Partnership to conduct the proposed business
at the Shareholder Meeting. Class A shares registered directly in your name with the transfer agent will be counted as present at the Shareholder
Meeting if you (i) are present in person at the Shareholder Meeting or (ii) have submitted and not revoked a properly executed proxy card or have
submitted and not revoked your proxy via telephone or the Internet. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be counted as Class A shares
that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker,
your Class A shares will not be voted on any proposal on which your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is referred to in
this proxy statement and in general as a broker non-vote. In these cases, the broker can register your Class A shares as being present at the
Shareholder Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be able to vote on those matters for which specific authorization is
required. If you fail to submit a proxy or vote in person at the Shareholder Meeting, your Class A shares will not count for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present.

 
Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement (including its Annexes and the documents referenced
under “Where You Can Find More Information”), please submit your proxy by completing, signing and mailing your proxy card or via telephone
or the Internet as soon as possible so that your Class A shares can be represented at the Shareholder Meeting. Your vote is important. Whether or
not you plan to attend the Shareholder Meeting, you should sign and mail your proxy card or submit your proxy via telephone or the Internet at
your first convenience. Remember, if you fail to vote your Class A shares, that will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the Merger
Proposals.

Shareholder of Record. If you are a shareholder of record, you may have your Class A shares voted on matters presented at the Shareholder
Meeting in any of the following ways:

 

 •  by proxy—shareholders of record have a choice of having their Class A shares voted by proxy:
 

 
•  through the Internet by logging onto the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card and following the prompts using the control

number located on the enclosed proxy card;

Table of Contents

 
•  by telephone (from the United States, U.S. territories and Canada) using the toll-free telephone number listed on the enclosed proxy

card and following the prompts using the control number located on the enclosed proxy card; or
 

 •  by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope; or
 

 
•  in person—you may attend the Shareholder Meeting and cast your vote there provided that you bring a government-issued picture

identification.

If you choose to submit a proxy by mailing a proxy card, your proxy card should be mailed in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, and your
proxy card must be received by the General Partner’s General Counsel by the time the Shareholder Meeting begins.

Beneficial Owner. If you are a beneficial owner, you should receive instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee that you must follow in
order to have your Class A shares voted. Those instructions will identify which of the above choices are available to you in order to have your
Class A shares voted. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote in person at the Shareholder Meeting, you must provide a
“legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee at the Shareholder Meeting. To attend the meeting in person (regardless of whether you
intend to vote your Class A shares in person at the meeting), you must bring a government-issued picture ID.

For additional information regarding how to vote your Class A shares, see “Information about the Shareholder Meeting and Voting.”

 
Q: What can I do if I change my mind after I have submitted my proxy for my Class A shares?
 

A: If your Class A shares are registered directly in your name with the transfer agent, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
Shareholder Meeting by:

 

 •  submitting another proxy prior to the Shareholder Meeting through any of the methods available to you;
 

 
•  giving written notice of revocation to the General Partner’s General Counsel, which must be received by the General Counsel by the time

the Shareholder Meeting begins; or
 

 •  attending the meeting and voting your Class A shares in person.

If your Class A shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions of your bank, broker or other nominee
regarding the revocation of proxies. If your bank, broker or other nominee allows you to submit your proxy via telephone or Internet, you may be
able to change your vote by submitting a proxy again by telephone or Internet.

See “Information about the Shareholder Meeting and Voting.”

 
Q: What is a proxy?
 

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your Class A shares. The written document describing the
matters to be considered and voted on at the Shareholder Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” A “proxy card” is a document used to designate a
proxy to vote your Class A shares.

See “Information about the Shareholder Meeting and Voting.”

 
Q: If a Shareholder gives a proxy, how are its Class A shares voted?
 

A: Regardless of how you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your Class A shares in the way that you
indicate. When completing the Internet or telephone processes or the

proxy card, you may specify whether your Class A shares should be voted “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or whether you wish to “ABSTAIN” from
voting, on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Shareholder Meeting.

If you own Class A shares that are directly registered in your name with the transfer agent and return a signed proxy card or submit your proxy via
the Internet or by telephone but do not indicate how you wish your Class A shares to be voted, the Class A shares represented by your properly
submitted proxy card will be voted “FOR” the Merger Proposals.

See “Information about the Shareholder Meeting and Voting.”

 
Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card?
 

A: If you received more than one proxy card, your Class A shares are likely registered in different names or with different addresses or are in more
than one account. You must separately vote the Class A shares shown on each proxy card that you receive in order for all of your Class A
shares to be voted at the meeting.

See “Information about the Shareholder Meeting and Voting.”

 
Q: What happens if I sell my Class A shares before the Shareholder Meeting?
 

A: The record date for Shareholders entitled to vote at the Shareholder Meeting is earlier than both the date of the Shareholder Meeting and the
consummation of the Transactions. If you transfer your Class A shares after the record date of the Shareholder Meeting but before the Shareholder
Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you transfer your Class A
shares and each of you notifies the Partnership in writing of such special arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such Class A shares at the
Shareholder Meeting but will transfer the right to receive the Share Merger Consideration if the Transactions are consummated to the person to
whom you transfer your Class A shares.

See “Information about the Shareholder Meeting and Voting.”

 
Q: What happens if I sell my Class A shares after the Shareholder Meeting but before the effectiveness of the Partnership Merger?
 

A: If you transfer your Class A shares after the Shareholder Meeting but before the effectiveness of the Partnership Merger, you will have transferred
the right to receive the Share Merger Consideration if the Transactions are consummated to the person to whom you transfer your Class A shares.
In order to receive the Share Merger Consideration, you must hold your Class A shares through completion of the Transactions.

 
Q: Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
 

A: The Partnership has engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Shareholder Meeting.
Innisfree will be paid approximately $25,000 by the Partnership for these and other consulting, analytic and advisory services in connection with
the Shareholder Meeting. In the event of obtaining Shareholder Approval, the Partnership will pay an additional $25,000 to Innisfree. In addition,
the Partnership has agreed to reimburse Innisfree for certain fees and expenses and will also indemnify Innisfree, its subsidiaries and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents against certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses. Forms of proxies and proxy
materials may also be distributed through brokers, banks and other nominees to the beneficial owners of Class A shares, in which case these
parties will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Table of Contents

Q: How will I receive the Share Merger Consideration to which I am entitled?
 

A: Promptly after the Closing, a paying agent reasonably acceptable to, and appointed by, the Partnership (the “Paying Agent”) will mail or provide
to each holder of record of Class A shares certain transmittal materials and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Class A shares to the
Paying Agent. If your Class A shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should contact your bank, broker or
other nominee for instructions as to how to effect the surrender of your “street name” Class A shares in exchange for the Share Merger
Consideration.

See “The Merger Agreement—Payment for the Class A shares.”

 
Q: Am I entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights?
 

A: No. Under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, as amended, and the Partnership Agreement, no dissenters’ or appraisal rights
are available, or will be available, with respect to the Transactions.

 
Q: What are the expected U.S. federal income tax consequences to a Shareholder as a result of the Transactions?
 

A: The receipt of the Share Merger Consideration in the Partnership Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders (as defined in “The Mergers
—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, the Partnership Merger will be treated as a
taxable sale of a U.S. holder’s Class A shares in exchange for the Share Merger Consideration. A U.S. holder generally will recognize capital gain
or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Class A
shares exchanged therefor.

The Transactions (other than the Partnership Merger) will have no U.S. federal income tax consequences for U.S. holders of the Class A shares.

See “The Mergers—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a more complete discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Partnership Merger.

 
Q: What is “householding”?
 

A: The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as brokers or banks) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy
statements with respect to two or more security holders sharing the same address by delivering a single notice or proxy statement addressed to
those security holders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for security holders
and cost savings for companies.

Banks, brokers and other nominees with accountholders who are Shareholders may be “householding” the Partnership’s proxy materials. As
indicated in the notice provided by these banks, brokers and other nominees to Shareholders, a single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple
Shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected Shareholder. Once you have received notice
from your bank, broker or other nominee that it will be “householding” communications to your address, “householding” will continue until you
are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and you prefer to
receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your bank, broker or other nominee or contact Innisfree, the Partnership’s proxy solicitor, by
calling toll-free at (877) 750-8338 or write to the following address:

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All
statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements
of future expectations that are based on the Partnership’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties
and projections of results of operations or of financial condition or forecasts of future events that could cause actual results, performance or events to
differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Words such as “could,” “will,” “may,” “assume,” “forecast,” “position,” “predict,”
“strategy,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “project,” “budget,” “potential” or “continue” and similar expressions are
used to identify forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this proxy
statement include statements concerning the Partnership’s expectations of plans, strategies, objectives, growth and anticipated financial and operational
performance, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to termination of the Merger Agreement; the inability to
complete the Mergers due to the failure to obtain the requisite approvals for the Mergers or the failure to satisfy other conditions to completion of the
Mergers, including that a governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the Mergers; risks related to
disruption of management’s attention from the Partnership’s ongoing business operations due to the Transactions; and the effects of future litigation,
including litigation relating to the Mergers. Forward-looking statements can be affected by assumptions used or by known or unknown risks or
uncertainties. Consequently, no forward-looking statements can be guaranteed.

A forward-looking statement may include a statement of the assumptions or bases underlying the forward-looking statement. The Partnership
believes that it has chosen these assumptions or bases in good faith and believes that they are reasonable. However, when considering these forward-
looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this proxy statement and the Partnership’s other filings
with the SEC, including the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2017 and any updates thereto in the
Partnership’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Those risk factors and other factors noted throughout this
proxy statement could cause the Partnership’s actual results to differ materially from those disclosed in any forward-looking statement. You are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.

Among other risks and uncertainties, there can be no guarantee that the Mergers will be completed, or if they are completed, the time frame in
which they will be completed. The Transactions are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the Merger Agreement.

Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement and the Partnership undertakes no obligation to publicly
update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law.

converted into a number of Class A shares equal to the number of Class A shares canceled pursuant to (i) above. In addition, and notwithstanding the
cancellation of Class A shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following the Partnership Merger Effective Time, holders as of the relevant record
date of Class A shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time will have continued rights to any distribution

Partnership Distribution”)

The Merger Consideration will be adjusted at the Closing at a set daily rate representing cash expected to be generated between December 1, 2017
and the Closing, less distributions declared (to the extent the record date has passed prior to the Closing) or paid after January 12, 2018 and prior to the
Closing.

The General Partner Interest (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) will be unaffected by the Mergers and will remain outstanding, such that,
upon the Equity Transfers, the General Partner Interest will be owned, directly or indirectly, by 8point3 Solar or an affiliate of 8point3 Solar designated
by 8point3 Solar.

Background of the Mergers

The Partnership conducted its initial public offering in June 2015, at which time the Partnership stated that its primary business objective was to
generate predictable cash distributions that grow at a sustainable rate. The Partnership stated that it intended to achieve this objective by acquiring high-
quality solar assets primarily developed by the Sponsors that generate long-term contracted cash flows and serve utility, commercial and industrial and
residential customers in the United States and other select markets, primarily within the countries that comprise the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development. In connection with the initial public offering, each Sponsor granted the Partnership rights of first offer on certain of
such Sponsor’s solar energy projects that were contracted or were expected to be constructed and contracted prior to being sold, should such Sponsor
decide to sell such projects before June 24, 2020. Primarily as a result of the acquisition of certain solar energy projects pursuant to the Partnership’s
right of first offer, the Partnership increased its quarterly distributions over time from its initial quarterly distribution of $0.2097 per Class A share in the
third quarter of 2015 (prorated to $0.157 per Class A share due to a shortened post-initial public offering quarter) to $0.2802 per Class A share in the
fourth quarter of 2017, or an increase of approximately 34% in less than two and half years.

Despite such initial success in achieving its objective, in mid-2016, the Partnership started to experience market conditions which challenged its
ability to finance additional growth. Such market conditions included an increase in the Partnership’s cost of capital, which made it more difficult for the
Partnership to access the equity capital markets on an attractive and consistent basis. In addition, the Partnership did not consider it practicable to access
the debt capital markets due to its leverage and restrictions in the Existing Credit Facility on incurring additional senior indebtedness. As a result of
these challenges, the Partnership required a loan from First Solar, which was issued as subordinated indebtedness to comply with such restrictions in the
Existing Credit Facility, to be able to complete its acquisition of the Stateline Project (the Partnership’s last acquisition of a new project) and found it
necessary to waive its rights of first offer on a number of the other projects offered to it. In addition to the challenges that the Partnership was
experiencing related to its inability to finance acquisitions, the nature of the solar industry was evolving which enabled the Sponsors to sell projects at an
earlier stage of construction than was best suited for the Partnership. In order to acquire such projects, the Partnership, whose primary business objective
is to generate predictable cash distributions from acquiring complete or substantially complete projects, would need to start acquiring projects that were
still under construction, which would require additional capital to fund such projects to commercial operation. For these reasons, and because First Solar
had been taking actions to strategically align its resources and capital in support of its transition to its new Series 6 product offering, First Solar decided
to explore options for the sale of its interests in the Partnership.

On March 23, 2017, at a meeting of the General Partner Board, First Solar advised the General Partner Board that it would be considering
alternatives for its interests in the Partnership Entities. During the discussion, Mr. Charles Boynton, chairman of the General Partner Board and chief
executive officer of the General Partner as well as chief financial officer of SunPower, noted that SunPower, after learning of First Solar’s strategic
review process, held several discussions with potential purchasers of First Solar’s interests, none of which progressed to concrete proposals, and
Mr. Boynton indicated SunPower’s willingness to review alternatives in respect of its interests in the Partnership Entities. At the conclusion of the
meeting, it was determined that the members of the General Partner Board and representatives of each of the Sponsors would confer to address the
Sponsors’ next steps. Ultimately, the Sponsors decided to launch a formal transaction process. To assist with this process, First Solar retained Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“BofA Merrill Lynch”) to act as financial advisor to First Solar.

While SunPower initially desired to retain its interests in the Partnership Entities and to replace First Solar with a new strategic partner that had a
portfolio of assets it could sell to the Partnership, SunPower also initiated a broader strategic review of its interests to consider all options. SunPower
retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Goldman Sachs” and, together with BofA Merrill Lynch, the “Sponsor Financial Advisors”) to act as financial
advisor to SunPower in connection with such process.

On March 31, 2017, the GP Conflicts Committee held a meeting with representatives of Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A., legal advisor to the GP
Conflicts Committee (“RL&F”), to discuss the Sponsors’ planned announcement of their intention to explore strategic options for disposing of their
interests in the Partnership Entities, the potential impact of such disposition on the outlook for the Partnership and the publicly held Class A shares and
the potential role for the GP Conflicts Committee in connection with such a disposition.

On April 5, 2017, First Solar issued a press release stating that it was working together with its financial and legal advisors to review alternatives
for the sale of its interests in the Partnership Entities. Likewise, SunPower issued a press release stating that it was evaluating strategic options for its
investment in the Partnership Entities. First Solar and SunPower stated that they would be coordinating their review of their alternatives related to the
Partnership Group, which would include a replacement of First Solar.

On April 5, 2017, the Partnership announced in its earnings release for the first quarter of 2017 stating that (i) the General Partner Board had been
informed of the strategic review that had been initiated by the Sponsors, (ii) the Sponsors’ strategic review process may result in interest from third
parties about acquiring the public ownership in the Partnership as well as the Sponsors’ interests and (iii) any potential transaction arising out of such
review that involved the potential acquisition by a third party of the public Class A Shares would be referred to the GP Conflicts Committee.

On April 7, 2017, representatives of each of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors, Baker Botts L.L.P., counsel for SunPower and the
Partnership (“Baker Botts”), and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel for First Solar and the Partnership (“Skadden”), met to discuss
preliminary matters pertaining to the contemplated transaction and alternatives, including (i) a sale of just First Solar’s interests in the Partnership
Entities to SunPower or a third party, with the Partnership remaining a publicly traded partnership, (ii) a sale of both First Solar’s and SunPower’s
interests in the Partnership Entities, with the Partnership remaining a publicly traded partnership, and (iii) a sale of all of the interests in the Partnership
Entities, with the Partnership no longer remaining a publicly traded partnership, and the viability of each alternative, and to coordinate outreach for the
contemplated transaction. If either SunPower or First Solar ceased to be a sponsor, it would be removed as a potential source of acquisition opportunities
and therefore remove committed sources of projects that would enable the Partnership’s primary business objective of generating predictable cash
distributions that grow at a sustainable rate.

On April 10, 2017, representatives of the Sponsors and the members of the GP Conflicts Committee met to discuss the status of the strategic
review process, including the engagement of the Sponsor Financial Advisors by

the Sponsors, the proposed acquisition alternatives, the breadth of the “Phase I” confidentiality agreements and an expected timeline of the process.

From April 7, 2017 to May 16, 2017, representatives of each of the Sponsor Financial Advisors and the Sponsors began their marketing efforts
and engaged in discussions with 131 different potential counterparties regarding a possible transaction through various alternatives. These counterparties
included infrastructure investors, pension funds, public corporations and partnerships, and other strategic and financial investors. These discussions
advanced with 37 counterparties to a point where most counterparties and each Sponsor executed a confidentiality agreement, at which time such
counterparty received a “Phase I” process letter and management presentation that included only publicly available information. A minority of the
counterparties did not execute a confidentiality agreement and continued their respective due diligence efforts on solely public information. The “Phase
I” process letter provided guidelines for the submission of a preliminary non-binding indication of interest (“Indication of Interest”), which included
identifying (i) the prospective counterparty, (ii) the counterparty’s preferences regarding the various transaction alternatives, (iii) the valuation
methodology used and assumptions made by the counterparty, (iv) the counterparty’s sources of financing and (v) any material conditions or approvals
applicable with respect to such Indication of Interest. The “Phase I” process letter also detailed that due diligence during this phase would be limited to
public information.

During the course of April 2017, the GP Conflicts Committee held multiple meetings with representatives of Evercore and RL&F to discuss
potential dropdown transactions proposed by First Solar involving the California Flats solar generation project in California (the “California Flats
Project”) and the Cuyama solar generation project in California (the “Cuyama Project”) and, as further discussed below, to discuss the potential of an
offer being made by SunPower for a dropdown transaction involving the Boulder Solar I solar generation project in Nevada (the “Boulder Solar
Project”). Following a consideration of, among other things, a review of financial projections for each of the California Flats Project and the Cuyama
Project, the Partnership’s ability to finance one or more of the transactions, restrictions on the Partnership in the loan from First Solar in connection with
the acquisition of interests in the Stateline Project, the fact that the California Flats Project and Cuyama Project were offered without a tax equity buyer
or a joint venture partner in place and would therefore require the Partnership to fund the projects to commercial operation, the GP Conflicts Committee
recommended that OpCo waive the 45-day negotiation period under the Right of First Offer Agreement, dated as of June 24, 2015, as amended, by and
between OpCo and First Solar (the “First Solar ROFO Agreement”) with respect to the California Flats Project and the Cuyama Project. On May 15,
2017, OpCo waived the 45-day negotiation period under the First Solar ROFO Agreement with respect to the California Flats Project and the Cuyama
Project. On July 27, 2017, First Solar sold the Cuyama Project to a third party and on August 21, 2017, First Solar sold the California Flats Project to an
affiliate of Capital Dynamics; both projects were sold at a purchase price above the price offered to the Partnership.

On May 8, 2017, representatives of the Sponsors and the members of the GP Conflicts Committee met to discuss the status of the strategic review
process, including the timeline of the next phase of the process and certain tax matters.

From May 23, 2017 to May 25, 2017, the Sponsor Financial Advisors received a total of nine written Indications of Interest from potential
counterparties (of which eight preferred to acquire the entire Partnership Group). Later, on June 25, 2017, the Sponsor Financial Advisors received a
written Indication of Interest from Capital Dynamics, which also preferred to acquire the entire Partnership Group (collectively, the “Phase I Bidders”).
In addition to these Indications of Interest being non-binding, they were subject to various conditions, including completion of due diligence on the
Partnership Group, the negotiation of definitive documentation and the receipt of internal approvals of the Phase I Bidders, and could not be transacted
upon in their current state. Additionally, the Sponsor Financial Advisors received seven informal, verbal expressions of interest from separate potential
counterparties. Representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors subsequently had conversations with many of these potential counterparties to discuss
and clarify the Indications of Interest or the informal expressions of interest.

From May 25, 2017 through June 18, 2017, given the overwhelming preference of the potential counterparties for a sale of the entire Partnership
Group, the Sponsors negotiated with each other regarding the consideration required by SunPower for agreeing to enter into such transaction. Such
negotiations focused on the provisions of the limited liability company agreement of Holdings and the General Partner related to the consent rights of
SunPower related to the sale of First Solar’s interests in the Partnership Entities. On June 19, 2017, the Sponsors agreed that First Solar would pay
SunPower additional consideration from the proceeds it receives at the Closing. The effect of this agreement is that, based upon the unadjusted Unit
Merger Consideration of $12.35 per unit, First Solar will receive an aggregate of approximately $242.8 million (or $10.98 per OpCo Unit) and
SunPower will receive an aggregate of approximately $387.1 million (or $13.40 per OpCo Unit). See “The Mergers—Interests of Certain Persons in the
Mergers—Interests of the Sponsors” for a description of this agreement.

On May 30, 2017, representatives of the Sponsors and the members of the GP Conflicts Committee met to discuss the status of the strategic
review process and next steps. At the meeting, Mr. Boynton reviewed the materials regarding the strategic review process prepared by the Sponsor
Financial Advisors, which were previously circulated to the GP Conflicts Committee. Mr. Boynton discussed the marketing efforts, the number of Phase
I Bidders, the range of bids received and remaining due diligence efforts to be completed by the Phase I Bidders.

Between June 19, 2017 and June 28, 2017, representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors contacted the Phase I Bidders to inform them of next
steps, including selection for the “Phase IIA” process, which required the execution of a revised confidentiality agreement and included access to
non-public information related to the Partnership. In addition, some of the bidders that only showed verbal interest were, at the direction of the
Sponsors, invited to sign a revised confidentiality agreement and participate in the next round. The form confidentiality agreement covered all
documents, analyses, forecasts, and other information provided to the bidders, including the status of the transaction, and included a standstill provision.

On June 28, 2017, the General Partner Board held its regular quarterly meeting, at which the Sponsor Financial Advisors reviewed materials
regarding the transaction process, including an update with regard to the number of Indications of Interest received, the identity of the Phase I Bidders
(including specifics of each bid) and the next steps. The General Partner Board reviewed the discussions between the Sponsors related to the process and
the agreement among the Sponsors related to a division of proceeds from a sale of the Sponsors’ interests. In addition, the GP Conflicts Committee held
a meeting with representatives of RL&F to discuss the initial Indications of Interest and that such bidders were predominantly interested in buying both
the publicly held Class A shares of the Partnership and the Sponsors’ interests in the Partnership Entities, which would result in the acquisition of 100%
of the Partnership Group. The GP Conflicts Committee discussed its role in connection with the sales process and its need to be fully informed and
engaged with respect to the sales process.

Between June 28, 2017 and July 25, 2017, the Sponsors negotiated the revised confidentiality agreements with some of the Phase I Bidders and
some of the bidders that only showed verbal interest. Of these 15 bidders invited to participate in “Phase IIA,” 14, including Capital Dynamics, executed
the revised confidentiality agreement and received a detailed project overview presentation and a financial model. Of the 14 bidders that executed the
revised confidentiality agreement, seven submitted Phase IIA Bids (as defined below) and the remaining bidders declined to continue.

Beginning on July 13, 2017, at the direction of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors sent the “Phase IIA” process letter and financial
projections that had been prepared by management (which were the same as those later given to Evercore) to the various counterparties that executed the
revised confidentiality agreement. The process letter outlined the procedures for submitting a non-binding indication of interest for the proposed
transaction by July 31, 2017. The process letter required potential counterparties to indicate their preference for transaction options among (i) only
acquiring the Sponsors’ combined stakes in the Partnership Entities and (ii) acquiring 100% of the Partnership Group. In addition to the information
requested by the “Phase I” process

letter, the “Phase IIA” process letter also requested the prospective counterparties to submit their expectations regarding (a) the Sponsors’ continued
activities under the operations and maintenance agreements and management services agreements for the existing Partnership Group projects, (b) the
potential sources of financing for the transactions and (c) the level of review, authorization and approvals needed within each bidder’s organization.
Following the distribution of the “Phase IIA” process letter, at the direction of the Sponsors, representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors held
meetings with many of these bidders (the “Phase IIA Bidders”) to discuss the financial model, including a call with Capital Dynamics on July 26, 2017.

On July 28, 2017, the GP Conflicts Committee held a meeting with representatives of RL&F. The GP Conflicts Committee discussed, among
other things, organizational matters in connection with the possibility that the Sponsors, after consulting with the Sponsor Financial Advisors, could
come to the conclusion that the most attractive offers received as a result of the Sponsors’ sale process were for all of the Sponsors’ interests in the
Partnership Entities and also for all the publicly held Class A shares. The GP Conflicts Committee had an initial discussion regarding the potential future
engagement of Evercore as its financial advisor with respect to the potential transaction and Evercore’s experience. The GP Conflicts Committee also
discussed the potential of an offer being made by SunPower for a dropdown transaction involving the Boulder Solar Project. Following consideration of,
among other things, the difficulty the Partnership would face in financing the acquisition of the Boulder Solar Project, the GP Conflicts Committee
concluded that, if an offer were received, it would likely recommend that OpCo waive the 45-day negotiation period under the Right of First Offer
Agreement, dated as of June 24, 2015, as amended, by and between OpCo and SunPower (“the SunPower ROFO Agreement”) with respect to the
Boulder Solar Project. Later, on July 28, 2017, OpCo received an offer from SunPower with respect to the Boulder Solar Project and on August 11,
2017, OpCo waived the 45-day negotiation period under the SunPower ROFO Agreement with respect to the Boulder Solar Project. SunPower
subsequently sold the Boulder Solar Project on February 15, 2018 to a third party at a price above the price offered to the Partnership.

On July 31, 2017 and August 1, 2017, the Sponsor Financial Advisors received seven “Phase IIA” non-binding bids, including a non-binding bid
from Capital Dynamics (the “Phase IIA Bids”). Of the seven Phase IIA Bidders, six preferred acquiring 100% of the interests in the Partnership Entities.
Two bidders (Bidder B and, initially, Capital Dynamics) suggested they would be open to the possibility of either investment alternative. One bidder
preferred acquiring only the Sponsors’ combined stakes in the Partnership Entities (but was open to the possibility of acquiring all of the interests in the
Partnership Entities). All Phase IIA Bids were subject to continued due diligence. Additionally, on July 31, 2017, the Sponsor Financial Advisors
received a telephone call from one of the Phase I Bidders that had not submitted a Phase IIA Bid. On the call, the counterparty verbalized an offer to
purchase all interests in the Partnership Entities for approximately $11.00 per share. The Sponsor Financial Advisors had no further discussions with this
counterparty, nor did they receive a Phase IIA bid from such counterparty despite additional follow-up. The following is a summary of each non-binding
Phase IIA Bid received by the Sponsor Financial Advisors:
 

 
•  Bidder A, a publicly traded strategic buyer, submitted a Phase IIA Bid on July 31, 2017. The non-binding bid contemplated a combination of

stock and cash consideration and valued the Partnership Entities at approximately $949-$989 million (or $12.00-$12.50 per share).
Additionally, Bidder A proposed that it would pay cash to the Sponsors, but a combination of stock and cash to the Public Shareholders.

 

 
•  Bidder B, a publicly traded strategic buyer, submitted a Phase IIA Bid on July 31, 2017. The non-binding bid contemplated cash

consideration and valued the Partnership Entities between approximately $1.107 billion and $1.147 billion (or $14.00-$14.50 per share).
Bidder B’s bid assumed that the Partnership’s cash balance would be approximately $42 million at the closing of the transactions.

 

 
•  Bidder C, a publicly traded strategic buyer, submitted a Phase IIA Bid on July 31, 2017. The non-binding bid contemplated cash

consideration and valued the Partnership Entities at approximately $1.147 billion (or $14.50 per share).

•  Bidder D, a publicly traded strategic buyer, submitted a Phase IIA Bid on August 1, 2017. The non-binding bid contemplated a combination

of stock and cash consideration and valued the Partnership Entities at approximately $1.201 billion (or $15.19 per share).
 

 
•  Bidder E, a financial sponsor, submitted a Phase IIA Bid on July 31, 2017. The non-binding bid contemplated cash consideration and valued

the Partnership Entities at $11.50-$12.50 per share. Bidder E stated that it would require a period of exclusivity to conduct its final due
diligence.

 

 
•  Bidder F, a financial sponsor, submitted a Phase IIA Bid on August 1, 2017. The non-binding bid contemplated cash consideration and

valued the Partnership Entities at approximately $909 million (or $11.50 per share). Bidder F indicated that it preferred acquiring only the
Sponsors’ interests but that it was also open to the possibility of acquiring all of the interests in the Partnership Entities.

 

 

•  Capital Dynamics submitted a Phase IIA Bid on July 31, 2017. The non-binding bid contemplated cash consideration and valued the
Partnership Entities at $976 million (or $12.35 per share). Capital Dynamics initially indicated that it preferred acquiring all of the interests
in the Partnership Entities, but it was also open to the possibility of acquiring only the Sponsors’ interests. On August 2, 2017, Capital
Dynamics clarified that it was solely interested in acquiring all of the interests in the Partnership Entities.

On August 1, 2017, SunPower announced its earnings release, which stated that the strategic review process of the sale of the Partnership Group
was continuing and that the Sponsors had received significant initial interest in the acquisition of the Sponsors’ interest in the General Partner or the sale
of the Partnership Group. The earnings release also stated that SunPower had made the decision not to actively seek a replacement partner for First Solar
and to focus its efforts on the monetization of its ownership stake in the Partnership Group.

On August 1, 2017 and August 2, 2017, representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors had conversations with all seven Phase IIA Bidders to
discuss and clarify the Phase IIA Bids. The focus of these calls was to clarify points made in the bid letters, gauge level of engagement and understand
the status of the Phase IIA Bidders’ due diligence processes. The Sponsor Financial Advisors discussed potential improvements to the Phase IIA Bids
with each Phase IIA Bidder in order to provide feedback prior to the binding bid, which was expected after conducting detailed due diligence in the next
phase of the process. The Sponsor Financial Advisors’ questions focused on key assumptions used by the Phase IIA Bidders in their bids (e.g., capital
structure, merchant power pricing, asset useful life, California property tax impact and operating assumptions), remaining due diligence, and source of
funding.

On August 2, 2017 and August 4, 2017, representatives of each of the Sponsors met with their respective Sponsor Financial Advisors to review
the Phase IIA Bids along with a bid summary prepared by the Sponsor Financial Advisors. After this review, the Sponsors agreed to invite each of the
Phase IIA Bidders to “Phase IIB” of the process, recognizing that some of the Phase IIA Bidders would require extensive additional due diligence and
would ultimately be unlikely to submit a competitive bid.

On August 9, 2017, all seven Phase IIA Bidders, including Capital Dynamics, started “Phase IIB.” During “Phase IIB,” the Phase IIA Bidders
received access to a virtual data room, which contained additional non-public information about the Partnership Group. Phase IIA Bidders were also
entitled to make selected site visits to the Partnership Group’s project sites and had multiple calls with representatives of the Sponsor Financial
Advisors. Additionally, most of the Phase IIA Bidders conducted detailed formal Q&A interactions with the Sponsors during Phase IIB.

On August 10, 2017, members of the General Partner Board, including the members of the GP Conflicts Committee, and representatives of each
of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors and RL&F met to receive an update from the Sponsor Financial Advisors regarding the process and
timing for Phase IIB and the substance of the subsequent interactions with the Phase IIA Bidders.

From August 14, 2017 to October 13, 2017, representatives of each of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors and the Phase IIB Bidders (as
defined below) had numerous telephone calls to discuss the Partnership’s projects, tax and insurance questions and general due diligence items.

Throughout the process, at the direction of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors also conducted many “check-in” calls with the Phase IIB
Bidders to gauge the level of interest from each bidder.

On August 28, 2017, the GP Conflicts Committee held a meeting with representatives of RL&F to further discuss the potential engagement of
Evercore as financial advisor to the GP Conflicts Committee in connection with a potential sale of the Partnership Group as a whole. The GP Conflicts
Committee considered Evercore’s knowledge and experience with respect to similar transactions, publicly traded partnerships in general, the Partnership
and its business and operations in particular, and the fact that Evercore had previously acted as advisor to the GP Conflicts Committee and delivered
excellent work product and financial advice. The GP Conflicts Committee also considered disclosures from Evercore with respect to its services and
relationships with certain potential bidders in connection with the potential transaction (which showed that Evercore did not receive any fees from
Capital Dynamics during the immediately prior two-year period). The GP Conflicts Committee determined that Evercore was well-positioned to provide
high quality, independent financial advice to the GP Conflicts Committee.

On August 29, 2017, Bidder F notified representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors that it was ending its participation in the transaction
process because Bidder F believed it would be unable to submit a competitive Phase IIB Bid (as defined below) after conversations with the Sponsor
Financial Advisors.

On September 6, 2017, Bidder E notified representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors that it was ending its participation in the transaction
process because Bidder E believed it would be unable to submit a competitive Phase IIB Bid after conversations with the Sponsor Financial Advisors.

On September 12, 2017, Baker Botts, Skadden and the Sponsors finalized drafts of the Merger Agreement, the partnership disclosure letter and the
support agreement (collectively, the “Bid Documents”), which were then uploaded to the data room. At the direction of the Sponsors, the Sponsor
Financial Advisors sent a “Phase IIB” letter to each of the five remaining bidders (Bidders A, B, C, D and Capital Dynamics) (the “Phase IIB Bidders”),
which requested each bidder to submit comments to each of the Bid Documents along with a binding acquisition proposal (each, a “Phase IIB Bid”).
The Sponsor Financial Advisors indicated that the deadline to submit a Phase IIB Bid was October 9, 2017. After receiving feedback from some of the
Phase IIB Bidders that they required more time for their due diligence efforts, the Sponsors directed representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors to
extend the deadline to receive “Phase IIB” bids to October 16, 2017.

On September 21, 2017, the General Partner Board held its regular quarterly meeting, at which representatives of each of the Sponsor Financial
Advisors reviewed materials regarding the transaction process, the investment profile of the Phase IIB Bidders, the various phases for the receipt of bids
submitted by the Phase IIB Bidders, the materials provided to the Phase IIB Bidders and an update with regard to next steps. Representatives of the
Sponsor Financial Advisors also reviewed the due diligence performed to date by the Phase IIB Bidders, including site visits, volume and nature of the
due diligence questions and Phase IIA Bids received. The meeting was limited to process-related topics, and there was no discussion on valuations or a
financial analysis of the bids. At such meeting, the General Partner Board authorized the GP Conflicts Committee to (i) review and evaluate the terms
and conditions, and determine the advisability, of the potential transaction on behalf of the Partnership and its subsidiaries and the public holders of
Class A shares, (ii) evaluate the merits of the potential transaction relative to the merits of maintaining the status quo, as the GP Conflicts Committee
deemed necessary or appropriate, (iii) negotiate on behalf of the Partnership and its subsidiaries and the public holders of Class A shares, or delegate the
ability to negotiate to any persons, with any party the GP Conflicts Committee deemed appropriate, with respect to the terms and conditions of the
potential transaction, (iv) determine whether to give or withhold the GP Conflicts Committee’s approval of the potential transaction,

including by “Special Approval” pursuant to Section 7.9(a) of the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership dated
June 24, 2015, as heretofore amended (the “Partnership Agreement”), (v) make a recommendation to the General Partner Board whether to approve the
potential transaction, and (vi) if the potential transaction is approved by the GP Conflicts Committee and if applicable, make a recommendation to the
public holders of Class A shares whether to approve the potential transaction. The General Partner Board also authorized the GP Conflicts Committee to
select and retain its own independent advisors in connection with the potential transaction. In addition, the GP Conflicts Committee held a meeting with
representatives of RL&F and discussed the bids that had been received by the Sponsors for their interests in the Partnership Entities and also for all the
publicly held Class A shares, the sale process in general, the current participants in the process, preliminary bid amounts, status of due diligence and the
contemplated timing of the process. The GP Conflicts Committee also discussed the terms of the authority granted to it by the General Partner Board
with respect to the potential transaction.

On September 29, 2017, Bidder B notified representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors that it was ending its participation in the transaction
process because the Phase IIB Bid that it was prepared to submit, after completing due diligence and its valuation analysis and considering various
internal issues, was materially lower than its bid of July 31, 2017 and, after conversations with the Sponsor Financial Advisors, unlikely to be
competitive with other Phase IIB Bids.

On October 3, 2017, Bidder A informed representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors that it desired to partner with Bidder E to prepare and
submit a joint bid. Bidder E believed it could provide a more competitive bid if it bid jointly with Bidder A. After discussing such request with
representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors, the Sponsors permitted Bidder A and Bidder E to submit a joint bid.

On October 11, 2017, Bidder C notified representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors that it was ending its participation in the transaction
process because the Phase IIB Bid that it was prepared to submit, after completing due diligence and its valuation analysis and considering various
internal issues, was materially lower than its bid of July 31, 2017 and, after conversations with the Sponsor Financial Advisors, unlikely to be
competitive with other Phase IIB Bids.

On October 11, 2017, following negotiation of the terms of Evercore’s engagement, the GP Conflicts Committee engaged Evercore as its financial
advisor in connection with the potential sale of the Partnership Group and, upon request of the GP Conflicts Committee, Evercore agreed to deliver an
opinion to the GP Conflicts Committee in accordance with its customary practice and subject to the assumptions, procedures, qualifications and
limitations to be set forth in its written opinion with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the Partnership and to the public holders of
the Class A shares of the consideration to be received by the public holders of the Class A shares in the potential transaction.

On October 16, 2017, Bidder D notified representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors that it was ending its participation in the transaction
process because the Phase IIB Bid that it was prepared to submit, after completing due diligence and its valuation analysis and considering various
internal issues, was materially lower than its bid of August 1, 2017 and, after conversations with the Sponsor Financial Advisors, unlikely to be
competitive with other Phase IIB Bids.

On October 16, 2017, Capital Dynamics submitted its Phase IIB Bid (including a mark-up of the proposed merger agreement). Capital Dynamics
proposed a total equity market value of the Partnership Group of $985 million, representing a per share valuation of $12.45 per share/unit (subject to
confirmatory due diligence), which would be paid equally to holders of Class A shares, OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units in cash. No
consideration would be paid to the Sponsors for the IDRs or the General Partner Interest. The proposed financing of the transaction would come from a
combination of equity financing from Capital Dynamics’ investors and debt financing arranged through a committed bridge facility, which would be put
in place at signing of the merger agreement. Capital Dynamics proposed that its obligation to consummate the transaction would not be contingent on its
obtaining financing.

On October 17, 2017, Bidders A and E submitted their joint Phase IIB Bid (including a mark-up of the proposed merger agreement), which
detailed a proposal for the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding Class A shares on a fully diluted basis as well as 100% of the OpCo Common Units,
OpCo Subordinated Units, IDRs and the General Partner Interest. The bid confirmed that, since it was submitted as a joint bid between Bidders A and E,
both bidders had reached an agreement on the primary commercial terms of a partnership agreement between them prior to submission. The bid was
made without any site visits and only limited due diligence and proposed total consideration for the Partnership Entities’ interests of approximately
$977 million (subject to possible reductions after additional due diligence), and such consideration was not divided equally among the Class A shares,
OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units. Pursuant to the terms of the bid, the consideration payable on the Class A shares would be a
combination of cash and stock valued at $13.00 per share, while all OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units held by the Sponsors would
receive $12.00 per unit in cash. Further, up to $1.00 per unit of the consideration for the OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units held by the
Sponsors was contingent on the Partnership’s obtaining security for certain third-party obligations under the Maryland Solar project lease, potentially
reducing the amount to be received by the Sponsors on their OpCo Units to $11.00 per unit. No consideration would be paid to the Sponsors for the
IDRs or the General Partner Interest. The proposal also required gradual, pre-set termination of certain existing operation and maintenance services and
asset management agreements to which the Sponsors were parties, and the loss of cash flows associated with these agreements would further reduce the
economic value to be received by the Sponsors in connection with such proposal. In addition, the proposal requested a grant of exclusivity in
negotiations and that the Sponsors retain certain tax liabilities. The proposal also contemplated using one or more bridge lenders to finance the
transaction, but did not require the transaction be subject to a financing contingency.

Between October 16, 2017 and October 24, 2017, representatives of each of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors, Baker Botts and
Skadden reviewed the Phase IIB bids from Bidders A and E and from Capital Dynamics and met several times to discuss the terms of the Phase IIB
Bids. During such time, at the direction of the Sponsors, representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors had a call with Bidder A to clarify some of
the terms of its joint bid with Bidder E. The Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors, Baker Botts and Skadden discussed each Phase IIB Bid at length,
and the Sponsors concluded that each of the Phase IIB Bids was incomplete and that each of Bidders A and E and Capital Dynamics needed additional
time to perform due diligence to refine and finalize their Phase IIB Bids. The Phase IIB Bid from Bidders A and E contained a detailed schedule of
remaining due diligence that included items such as operations, tax and accounting matters. Additionally, the proposal from Bidders A and E requested
exclusivity to proceed. Due to the reasons mentioned above and the Sponsors’ belief that the joint-bid was not firm, the Sponsors did not provide
exclusivity to Bidders A and E.

On October 24, 2017, the Sponsors directed representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors to deliver feedback to each of the remaining Phase
IIB Bidders, which entailed providing such bidders an additional month to finalize their due diligence and produce a complete, binding offer that was
subject to as few contingencies as possible. Representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors advised each of the remaining Phase IIB Bidders to
improve the terms of their respective proposals, specifically on increasing their price.

Between October 24, 2017 and November 21, 2017, representatives of each of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors and Baker Botts
(i) held numerous calls with the remaining Phase IIB Bidders concerning their respective comments to the merger agreement and other key issues,
(ii) worked with each bidder to develop a transaction timeline for a definitive, binding bid, and (iii) provided additional due diligence to the bidders,
including permitting additional site visits.

On October 31, 2017, the GP Conflicts Committee held a meeting with representatives of Evercore and RL&F to discuss bids that had been
received by the Sponsors for all of the direct and indirect interests in the Partnership Entities. The GP Conflicts Committee discussed the status of the
bids, including initial markups of a proposed merger agreement submitted by the Phase IIB Bidders, the current state of the yield-oriented public
company, or YieldCo, market generally, the Partnership’s current trading price and other industry dynamics that

may affect the bids. The GP Conflicts Committee received an initial presentation from Evercore with respect to its preliminary financial analysis of the
potential transaction, the status of Evercore’s preliminary due diligence and management’s projections for the future financial performance of the
Partnership (which were the same as those provided to the Phase IIB Bidders), including projections with respect to the refinancing of the Partnership’s
debt obligations and with respect to free cash flow available to equity. Following the meeting on October 31, 2017 and regularly until approval of the
transaction, RL&F and Baker Botts and/or representatives of the Sponsors had discussions regarding the terms of the merger agreement and the views of
the GP Conflicts Committee with respect to the terms of the merger agreement.

On November 3, 2017, Capital Dynamics delivered a revised mark-up of the proposed merger agreement. The representatives of each of the
Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors, Baker Botts and Skadden met to discuss Capital Dynamics’ comments and noted a number of material issues,
including, but not limited to, Capital Dynamics’ request for post-closing indemnification from the Sponsors (the scope of which was later narrowed to
shareholder litigation only), the reimbursement of Capital Dynamics’ fees and out-of-pocket expenses in the event the transaction did not close, the
termination fee payable by Capital Dynamics in certain circumstances (including the potential escrow of the termination fee), certain covenants related
to the condition of the assets, the materiality standard used throughout the representation and warranties of the parties, certain valuation issues related to
working capital, certain tax matters and the acquisition of interests held by SunPower in certain of OpCo’s lower-tier Partnership Group entities.

On November 7, 2017 and November 14, 2017, at the direction of the Sponsors, representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors met with
representatives of the investment bank assisting Bidders A and E to assess Bidders A and E’s commitment to complete a transaction and to discuss
commercial aspects of their joint Phase IIB Bid. Bidders A and E’s bid raised a number of high-level commercial issues (as detailed above), which they
wanted resolved before they invested resources on further due diligence efforts. Representatives of the Sponsors, Bidder A and Bidder E met to discuss
these issues, but most remained unresolved at the end of the meeting. Following that meeting, Bidders A and E reduced their due diligence activity in
the post-“Phase IIB” period and requested exclusivity, which the Sponsors decided to not provide due to the extent of the unresolved issues and the
Sponsors’ belief that Bidders A and E would most likely seek additional reductions to the proposed merger consideration and material modifications to
the merger agreement once they had completed due diligence. Ultimately, Bidders A and E did not re-engage the Sponsors on the commercial issues and
eventually stopped participating in the transaction process. On November 14, 2017, representatives of the Sponsors met with the GP Conflicts
Committee to discuss the status of the commercial negotiations with Bidders A and E.

Also on November 7, 2017, representatives of SunPower met with representatives of Capital Dynamics to provide feedback on Capital Dynamics’
bid and to assess Capital Dynamics’ commitment to complete a transaction. As a result of that meeting, Capital Dynamics proposed further comments
on the merger agreement to the Sponsor Financial Advisors on November 10, 2017. Representatives of each of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial
Advisors, Baker Botts and Skadden met to discuss Capital Dynamics’ comments to the merger agreement, which reiterated the business issues
highlighted in their November 3, 2017 comments to the proposed merger agreement. The Sponsors, with the assistance of Baker Botts and Skadden,
prepared a revised draft of the merger agreement, which representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors delivered to Capital Dynamics on
November 14, 2017 with a request that Capital Dynamics provide their most competitive bid by the following week.

On November 8, 2017, in lieu of Capital Dynamics’ request for exclusivity, the Sponsors and Capital Dynamics entered into a letter agreement
regarding the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Capital Dynamics during the transaction process. The Sponsors agreed to reimburse Capital
Dynamics for half of the costs (up to $450,000 per Sponsor) associated with its due diligence efforts in the event that (i) Capital Dynamics’ binding bid
met certain conditions, including a binding proposal with a valuation of greater than, or equal to, $12.55 per Class A share, or OpCo Unit, respectively,
and (ii) Capital Dynamics was ultimately not selected as the final bidder.

On November 20, 2017, the GP Conflicts Committee held a meeting with representatives of Evercore and RL&F to discuss the bids that had been
received by the Sponsors for all of the interests in the Partnership

Entities, including the bid submitted by Capital Dynamics. RL&F presented the GP Conflicts Committee with a summary of the terms of the draft
merger agreement circulated by the Sponsors to potential bidders, which included the Partnership Agreement requirement that the transaction be
approved by the holders of a majority of the Class A shares of the Partnership that are not affiliated with the Sponsors, and a summary of the material
comments to the draft merger agreement provided by Capital Dynamics in connection with its bid.

On November 21, 2017, Capital Dynamics submitted its revised, binding proposal to acquire the Partnership Group for cash. The revised bid
implied a maximum total equity market value of $993 million, representing a per share valuation of $12.55. In its bid, Capital Dynamics requested a
reduction of $0.13 per share due to differences in value between the model provided by the Sponsors and the calculations with respect to tax basis and
depreciation performed by Capital Dynamics’ tax advisor. Additionally, Capital Dynamics proposal suggested that the valuation was subject to First
Solar’s executing a 6-year extension of the Maryland Solar lease. The final price would be adjusted upward for cash generated from December 1, 2017
through the Closing based on the expected daily cash flow accrual applicable for the quarter and downward for the amount of distributions declared (to
the extent that the record date has passed prior to the Closing) or paid prior to the Closing. The bid stated that Capital Dynamics desired to complete the
transaction with investments from certain investors, including certain non-U.S. investors that would become co-purchasers through a co-investment
process, and that it had secured written commitments from such investors; however, the proposal was clear that it was not dependent or contingent on
that process or any co-investors. Attached as part of the proposal was a binding commitment letter provided by The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, UFJ,
Ltd. for a bridge facility of $1.1 billion. The proposal stated that, aside from outstanding due diligence questions, Capital Dynamics required no further
confirmatory due diligence. The proposal was not subject to any financing contingencies. On November 22, 2017, Capital Dynamics clarified its bid to
representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors that the proposed valuation would be subject to a further reduction of $0.23 per share if First Solar did
not enter into an extension of the Maryland Solar lease. This reduction and the others mentioned above would potentially result in Capital Dynamics’
valuing the Partnership Entities at $12.19 per share.

Between November 21, 2017 and December 17, 2017, representatives of each of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors, Baker Botts and
Skadden negotiated the terms of the proposed merger agreement and the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters (as defined below under “—Financing
of the Mergers—Debt Financing”) with representatives of Capital Dynamics and Amis, Patel & Brewer, LLP, legal counsel to Capital Dynamics
(“APB”).

On November 28, 2017, the GP Conflicts Committee held a meeting with representatives of Evercore and RL&F to discuss the potential
transaction with Capital Dynamics. The GP Conflicts Committee received a presentation from Evercore discussing, among other things, Capital
Dynamics’ then-current bid, key issues that Capital Dynamics had identified as potentially affecting the financial terms of its bid, management’s
financial projections for the Partnership (which were the same as those provided to Evercore), the key assumptions made by management in connection
with its financial projections, certain sensitivity cases to management’s financial projections, Evercore’s preliminary financial analysis of the potential
transaction, and the proposed division of proceeds between the public holders of Class A shares and the Sponsors. Based upon the then-current bid from
Capital Dynamics, Evercore’s presentation to the GP Conflicts Committee considered a transaction in which the public holders of Class A shares would
receive consideration for their Class A shares in an amount less than the then-current trading price of the Class A shares. Following discussion, the GP
Conflicts Committee determined to propose to the Sponsors that the public holders of Class A shares receive $15.00 per Class A share in the potential
transaction with a corresponding reduction to the amount to be received by the Sponsors in the event that Capital Dynamics was not prepared to increase
its offer price. Following the meeting on November 28, 2017, Mr. O’Connor, the chair of the GP Conflicts Committee, informed Mr. Boynton of the GP
Conflicts Committee’s proposal and Messrs. O’Connor and Boynton agreed to have a follow-up conversation shortly.

On November 30, 2017, at the direction of the Sponsors and the GP Conflicts Committee, representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors met
with representatives of Evercore to discuss the GP Conflicts Committee’s proposal.

On December 4, 2017, representatives of each of the Sponsors and the GP Conflicts Committee discussed the GP Conflicts Committee’s request
that the public holders of Class A shares receive additional consideration on a per Class A share basis relative to the per Class A share consideration
received by the Sponsors from Capital Dynamics. Representatives of the Sponsors explained the extensive nature of the process, the indications of value
from the bids received and the unattractive alternatives for the Partnership as a standalone company due to the concerns mentioned above (see “The
Mergers—Recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board; Reasons for Recommending Approval of the Merger
Proposals”). Mr. Boynton informed Mr. O’Connor that the Sponsors would consider and respond to the GP Conflicts Committee.

The Sponsors, with the assistance of Baker Botts and Skadden, prepared a revised draft of the merger agreement which, at the direction of the
Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors delivered to Capital Dynamics on December 7, 2017.

On December 11, 2017, Mr. Boynton, after discussion with representatives of each of the Sponsors, informed Mr. O’Connor that the Sponsors
were not willing to provide the public holders of Class A shares with any additional consideration on a per Class A share basis relative to the per OpCo
Unit consideration being received by the Sponsors from Capital Dynamics. Mr. Boynton emphasized to Mr. O’Connor the Sponsors’ position that they
would be receiving the same per share/unit consideration from Capital Dynamics as the public holders of Class A shares and would not be receiving any
consideration for the IDRs and General Partner Interest, although sponsors often receive additional consideration for such interests, as well as the fact
that the Sponsors had run a comprehensive process to identify the most compelling proposals.

On December 12, 2017, the GP Conflicts Committee held a meeting with representatives of Evercore and RL&F to discuss Mr. Boynton’s
response to the GP Conflicts Committee’s proposal and the status of the potential transaction. The GP Conflicts Committee discussed the Sponsors’
rationale for not agreeing to provide more consideration to the public holders of Class A shares and factors that argued for and against the public holders
of Class A shares receiving different consideration than the Sponsors. The GP Conflicts Committee further discussed the prospects for the Partnership if
the potential transaction did not occur, including uncertainty surrounding the Partnership’s outlook for growth projects and uncertainty as to the level of
Sponsor support with respect to future potential transactions. The GP Conflicts Committee determined that it would not respond to Mr. Boynton at this
time pending receipt by the Partnership of an expected further revised bid from Capital Dynamics.

Later on December 12, 2017, Capital Dynamics sent to representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors comments to the merger agreement. In
such comments, Capital Dynamics acknowledged that a pre-signing increase to the policy limits on the Partnership’s directors’ and officers’ insurance in
lieu of post-closing indemnification by the Sponsors may be acceptable, but the valuation and expense reimbursement issues remained. Additionally, the
comments reflected resolution of various issues including escrowing the termination fee payable by Parent in certain circumstances, the materiality
standard used throughout the representation and warranties of the parties, certain covenants related to the condition of the assets, and certain tax matters.
Capital Dynamics’ comments included a request that SunPower’s Class A interests and Class C interests in certain lower-tier Partnership Group entities
be transferred to Capital Dynamics for no consideration and a request to increase the cap for expense reimbursement should the transaction not be
consummated. Capital Dynamics’ comments also proposed limiting Capital Dynamics’ liability if the transactions did not close due to a lack of CFIUS
Approval even if the lack of CFIUS Approval were due to the failure of Capital Dynamics or its affiliates to provide certain information to a
governmental authority. These comments rejected the Sponsors’ proposal for Parent to pay a termination fee in the event that a lack of CFIUS Approval
was due to the failure to provide such requested information.

On December 15, 2017, the General Partner Board held a special telephonic meeting, at which representatives of the Sponsors discussed with the
independent directors on the General Partner Board (who comprise the GP Conflicts Committee) details of the negotiations with Capital Dynamics, an
anticipated timeline for executing a transaction with Capital Dynamics if negotiations continued to advance, the continuing process of providing the GP

Conflicts Committee and Evercore with information from management of the Sponsors and representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors, and
proposed financial consideration for the various interests in the Partnership Entities. Mr. Boynton, speaking in his capacity as a representative of
SunPower, reiterated the Sponsors’ position that the Sponsors would not provide incremental value to the public holders of Class A shares because the
Sponsors would collectively be receiving the same per share/unit consideration from Capital Dynamics as the public holders of Class A shares and
would not be receiving any consideration for the IDRs and the General Partner Interest. The independent directors on the General Partner Board also
provided an update on the GP Conflicts Committee’s evaluation of Capital Dynamics’ proposed consideration and draft merger agreement.

On December 17, 2017, representatives of each of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors, Baker Botts and Skadden met with
representatives of Capital Dynamics and APB to discuss the issues that remained in the most recent comments provided by Capital Dynamics.

Between December 17, 2017 and January 4, 2018, advancement of the merger agreement continued as the parties considered internally the
remaining open issues in respect of all aspects of the proposed transaction, and, during this time, the parties continued to discuss a pre-signing increase
to the policy limits on the Partnership’s directors’ and officers’ insurance in lieu of post-closing indemnification by the Sponsors. The parties also
discussed scheduling an in-person negotiation session.

On December 20, 2017, the GP Conflicts Committee held a meeting with Evercore and RL&F to further discuss Evercore’s preliminary financial
analysis of the potential transaction with Capital Dynamics and open issues in the Merger Agreement. The GP Conflicts Committee received a
presentation from Evercore with respect to the potential transaction with Capital Dynamics and discussed, among other things, (i) Evercore’s
preliminary financial analysis of the potential transaction assuming that the holders of Class A shares receive $12.19 per Class A share in connection
with the potential transaction, (ii) the fact that the Sponsors likely could not consummate the potential transaction unless the Class A shares were part of
the transaction because Capital Dynamics indicated that it was not willing to agree to purchase only the Sponsors’ interests in the Partnership Entities,
(iii) the comprehensive auction process run by the Sponsors to identify potential bids for the Partnership Entities, (iv) potential factors that argue for and
against the public holders of Class A shares receiving more per share than the Sponsors in the potential transaction, (v) the fact that the Sponsors were
proposing to transfer the General Partner Interest in the Partnership and their incentive distribution rights in OpCo to Capital Dynamics for no
consideration, and (vi) that the Sponsors had firmly rejected the GP Conflicts Committee’s proposal that the public holders of Class A shares receive
premium consideration relative to the Sponsors. Following extensive discussion, the members of the GP Conflicts Committee concluded that the
Sponsors would not agree to allocate additional consideration to the public holders of Class A shares as part of the transaction and that the per Class A
share price offered by Capital Dynamics was likely going to be more attractive to the public holders of Class A shares than no transaction.

On December 22, 2017, at the direction of the Sponsors and the GP Conflicts Committee, representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors met
with representatives of Evercore and RL&F to explain and discuss the Sponsors’ marketing process for the contemplated transaction.

On January 5, 2018, representatives of each of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors, Baker Botts and Skadden discussed with
representatives of Capital Dynamics and APB the issues that remained in the draft merger agreement.

On January 7, 2018, the Sponsors, with the assistance of Baker Botts and Skadden, prepared a revised draft of the proposed merger agreement
with Capital Dynamics, and, at the direction of the Sponsors, representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors sent that draft to Capital Dynamics.

On January 9, 2018, representatives of each of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors, Baker Botts and Skadden and representatives of
Capital Dynamics and APB met in New York City to discuss the issues that remained in the draft merger agreement. At such meeting, the parties
discussed issues related to the requested

post-closing indemnification from the Sponsors and Capital Dynamics’ expense reimbursement. The parties agreed to obtain additional directors’ and
officers’ insurance in lieu of a post-closing indemnity from the Sponsors related to shareholder litigation, and agreed to the amount of the cap of expense
reimbursement. Additionally, the parties discussed the issue regarding the required efforts to obtain CFIUS Approval and remedies in the event CFIUS
Approval was not obtained. The parties agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval; however, with respect to Capital Dynamics,
such efforts did not require obtaining certain information from their non-U.S. investors if such investors objected to disclosing information in certain
situations. As a result, Capital Dynamics agreed to reimburse the Partnership’s expenses (subject to a cap) if CFIUS Approval was not obtained for any
reason. Also at such meeting, representatives of the Sponsors and Capital Dynamics met privately to finalize the merger consideration (including open
valuation issues discussed above, which at the time represented a reduction of approximately $0.36 to Capital Dynamics’ proposed offer of $12.55 per
share/unit). As a result of such discussions, Capital Dynamics and SunPower agreed to give First Solar the option of final merger consideration for all
Class A shares and OpCo Units equal to either (i) $12.30 per share/unit without an amendment to the Maryland Solar lease that eliminated automatic
termination in the event of FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.’s bankruptcy or (ii) $12.35 per share/unit with such an amendment of the Maryland Solar lease.
See “The Merger Agreement—Maryland Solar Lease Amendment” for a description of this amendment.

On January 13, 2018, First Solar, after a review of financial impacts, chose the proposal described in clause (ii) of the prior paragraph. The final
price for all Class A shares and OpCo Units would be adjusted upward for cash generated from December 1, 2017 through Closing based on the
expected daily cash flow accrual applicable for the quarter and downward for the amount of distributions declared (to the extent that the record date has
passed prior to Closing) or paid prior to Closing.

On January 16, 2018, the GP Conflicts Committee held a meeting with representatives of Evercore and RL&F to discuss Capital Dynamics’
revised merger consideration proposal and other elements of the potential transaction. The GP Conflicts Committee received a presentation from
Evercore with respect to the potential transaction with Capital Dynamics and discussed, among other things, (i) Evercore’s preliminary financial analysis
of the revised merger consideration proposed, (ii) a proposal by the Sponsors regarding the manner of paying the fees and expenses of the Sponsors, the
Partnership and OpCo in connection with the potential transaction (which proposal would not result in the Partnership or OpCo paying any fees of BofA
Merrill Lynch or Goldman Sachs in connection with the potential transaction), (iii) the agreement between the Sponsors regarding the division of the
Sponsors’ aggregate transaction consideration among them in connection with the consideration required by SunPower for agreeing to enter into such
transaction, (iv) the Sponsors’ position that the Sponsors would not take less consideration per OpCo Unit to provide incremental value to the public
holders of Class A shares and (v) the open issues in the merger agreement being negotiated with Capital Dynamics. The GP Conflicts Committee
considered the fact that First Solar had agreed to pay some of the consideration it receives in the transaction to SunPower as described in clause (iii) of
this paragraph. Following discussion, the GP Conflicts Committee decided to propose to the Sponsors that the public holders of Class A shares would
receive consideration that was equivalent to the consideration that SunPower would be receiving, taking into account the division of proceeds from First
Solar to SunPower. Following the meeting on January 16, 2018, Mr. O’Connor informed Mr. Boynton of the GP Conflicts Committee’s proposal.

On January 16, 2018, Capital Dynamics sent its comments to the merger agreement to Baker Botts, which Baker Botts forwarded to
representatives of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors and Skadden.

On January 17, 2018, representatives of the Sponsors and Capital Dynamics, respectively, had a conversation to discuss outstanding issues,
including certain obligations of Capital Dynamics and its investors to provide responsive documentation to obtain CFIUS Approval and other regulatory
approvals. The parties also discussed the terms of a transition services agreement to be entered into at Closing.

On January 17, 2018, SunPower notified representatives of the GP Conflicts Committee, that it would be requesting a waiver from the
requirements of the SunPower ROFO Agreement for all projects still subject thereto

during the pendency of the Mergers, since the draft merger agreement did not permit acquisitions during such time and, even if that were not the case,
the Partnership Group would not have the financial ability to acquire such projects.

On January 19, 2018, Mr. Boynton, after discussions between representatives of First Solar and SunPower, responded by email to the GP Conflicts
Committee’s proposal that the public holders of Class A shares should receive consideration that is equivalent to the consideration that SunPower will
receive, taking into account the additional consideration that SunPower is receiving from First Solar and explained SunPower’s basis for why the public
holders of Class A shares should not receive the same consideration on a per Class A share basis as SunPower, including SunPower’s view of
(i) SunPower’s superior project performance in relation to First Solar’s project performance and SunPower’s resulting expectations for payments on the
IDRs, (ii) a provision in the limited liability company agreement of Holdings that may have resulted in a reallocation of distributions payable by
Holdings from First Solar to SunPower as a result of the performance of SunPower’s projects relative to First Solar’s projects, (iii) the fact that the
Sponsors are jointly receiving the same $12.35 per share/unit consideration as the public holders of Class A shares and have not requested a payment for
the IDRs or the General Partner Interest in the Partnership, and (iv) the fact that (a) SunPower agreed to transfer all of its Class A interests and Class C
interests in certain lower-tier Partnership Group entities to Capital Dynamics for no additional consideration and (b) First Solar agreed to amend the
Maryland Solar lease to eliminate termination in the event of FirstEnergy Solutions Corp.’s bankruptcy for no additional consideration in order to secure
the higher merger consideration offered by Capital Dynamics on behalf of all shareholders. See “The Merger Agreement—Maryland Solar Lease
Amendment” for a description of this amendment.

On January 22, 2018, SunPower held a meeting of its board of directors to evaluate the proposed transaction with Capital Dynamics and all
present board members voted to approve the transaction.

On January 23, 2018, First Solar held a meeting of its board of directors to evaluate the proposed transaction with Capital Dynamics and all
present board members voted to approve the transaction.

On January 24, 2018, Baker Botts sent a further revised draft of the merger agreement to APB.

On January 25, 2018, the GP Conflicts Committee met with representatives of Evercore and RL&F to discuss the Sponsors’ view that the public
holders of Class A shares should not receive the same consideration as SunPower, taking into account the additional consideration that SunPower is
receiving from First Solar. The GP Conflicts Committee discussed Mr. Boynton’s response rejecting the GP Conflicts Committee’s proposal, including
SunPower’s rationale. The GP Conflicts Committee further discussed (i) the current proposed terms for the potential transaction with Capital Dynamics,
including the fact that the consideration had been increased to $12.35 per Class A share, (ii) the then current trading price of Class A shares, (iii) the
outlook for the Partnership, including management’s financial projections for the Partnership (which were the same as those provided to Evercore) and a
related sensitivity case, (iv) that the potential transaction requires approval of the holders of a majority of the Class A shares that are not affiliates of the
Sponsors, (v) that the transaction had been broadly marketed, (vi) updates to the merger agreement with Capital Dynamics, and (vii) a request by
SunPower that the GP Conflicts Committee approve a waiver to SunPower’s ROFO Agreement that would allow SunPower to sell projects during the
period between signing and closing of the merger without offering them to OpCo. Following discussion, the GP Conflicts Committee determined that
Mr. O’Connor should again contact Mr. Boynton and discuss the GP Conflicts Committee’s request that the public holders of Class A shares receive
consideration that is no lower than the consideration that SunPower will receive, taking into account the additional consideration that SunPower is
receiving from First Solar.

On January 25, 2018, Messrs. Boynton and O’Connor discussed Mr. Boynton’s January 19th e-mail response to the GP Conflicts Committee,
Mr. Boynton reaffirmed that the Sponsors would not re-allocate any consideration payable to them by Capital Dynamics in the transaction to the public
holders of Class A shares due to the extensive sale process, the overall value being provided to the Class A shareholders given the challenging outlook
for the Partnership, the fact that the Sponsors are collectively receiving the same per unit consideration

as the public shareholders and no consideration for the General Partner Interest or the IDRs, First Solar’s agreement with Parent to waive certain lease
termination rights with Maryland Solar for no additional consideration and SunPower’s agreement with Parent to transfer ownership interests in certain
entities to Parent for no additional consideration. Later on January 25, 2018, Mr. Boynton sent a confirmatory e-mail on behalf of the Sponsors
reiterating that they would not agree to any re-allocation of consideration to the public holders of Class A shares.

On January 28, 2018, Capital Dynamics, through APB, sent Baker Botts comments to the merger agreement, which Baker Botts forwarded to
representatives of the Sponsors, the Sponsor Financial Advisors and Skadden. Over the ensuing days, the parties sent multiple revised drafts to finalize
the outstanding remaining issues.

On January 30, 2018, the General Partner Board held its regular quarterly meeting, at which representatives of the Sponsor Financial Advisors and
Baker Botts reviewed the transaction process, the terms of the proposed transaction with Capital Dynamics and expected timeline for the approval
process. The General Partner Board asked numerous questions of management and Baker Botts regarding the terms, process and timeline. In addition,
the GP Conflicts Committee met with representatives of Evercore and RL&F to discuss the status of the potential transaction with Capital Dynamics.
The GP Conflicts Committee received a presentation from Evercore with respect to the potential transaction with Capital Dynamics and discussed,
among other things, (i) Evercore’s financial analysis of the potential transaction with Capital Dynamics at $12.35 per Class A share, (ii) matters related
to the payment of distributions by the Partnership after execution of the merger agreement and how such payments adjust the amount payable to holders
of Class A shares, including the upward adjustments to the final price for cash generated from December 1, 2017 through Closing based on the expected
daily cash flow accrual applicable for the quarter and downward adjustments for the amount of distributions declared (to the extent that the record date
has passed prior to Closing) or paid prior to Closing, (iii) the agreement between First Solar and SunPower on the manner of allocating their aggregate
consideration between them in connection with the consideration required by SunPower for agreeing to enter into such transaction, (iv) the material
terms of the merger agreement, including an update on the negotiations between the Partnership and Capital Dynamics with respect to Capital
Dynamics’ obligation to pursue CFIUS Approval, (v) the letter agreement between the Partnership and the Sponsors that allocates certain transaction
expenses among the parties, (vi) the duties and obligations of the GP Conflicts Committee under Delaware law and the Partnership Agreement, and
(vii) SunPower’s request for a waiver of SunPower’s obligation to offer projects to the Partnership during the period between signing and closing of the
merger and the reasons for SunPower’s request.

Over the course of January 31, 2018 through the morning of February 5, 2018, representatives of the various parties and the GP Conflicts
Committee finalized documentation and resolved the remaining issues.

On February 5, 2018, the GP Conflicts Committee met with representatives of Evercore and RL&F to discuss the near final terms of the merger
agreement with Capital Dynamics. The GP Conflicts Committee received a presentation from Evercore with respect to the potential transaction with
Capital Dynamics and discussed Evercore’s financial analysis of the potential transaction with Capital Dynamics and the updates to its analysis since the
GP Conflicts Committee’s prior meeting, and RL&F summarized the terms of the merger agreement for the GP Conflicts Committee, including an
update on the negotiations between the Partnership and Capital Dynamics with respect to Capital Dynamics’ obligation to pursue CFIUS Approval.
Later that same day, the GP Conflicts Committee held a second meeting with representatives of Evercore and RL&F, wherein RL&F summarized
Capital Dynamics’ obligations under the merger agreement to obtain CFIUS Approval and Evercore confirmed that there were no material changes to
the financial analysis it presented to the GP Conflicts Committee earlier in the day. At the GP Conflicts Committee’s request, Evercore orally delivered
its opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) that, subject to the assumptions, procedures, qualifications and limitations to be set forth in
the written opinion, the consideration to be paid by Capital Dynamics pursuant to the merger agreement for each Class A share is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the Partnership and the Public Shareholders. Thereafter, the GP Conflicts Committee unanimously (i) determined that the Mergers,
including the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, are advisable, fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, the Partnership Group and the
Public Shareholders, (ii) approved the Mergers, including the Merger Agreement and

the Transactions, such approval constituting “Special Approval” pursuant to Section 7.9(a) of the Partnership Agreement, (iii) recommended to the
General Partner Board that the General Partner Board approve the Mergers and consummate the Transactions on the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement, (iv) recommended to the Public Shareholders that the Public Shareholders approve the Merger Agreement and the Mergers and (v) approved
a waiver from the requirements of the SunPower ROFO Agreement for all projects still subject thereto during the pendency of the Mergers.

Promptly after the GP Conflicts Committee meeting, the General Partner Board held a meeting to review the final changes to the proposed
transaction documents. After reviewing the final terms of the proposed transactions, Mr. Boynton asked for a report from the GP Conflicts Committee.
Mr. O’Connor reported to the General Partner Board (i) that Evercore had orally delivered its opinion (which was subsequently confirmed in writing) to
the GP Conflicts Committee that, subject to the assumptions, procedures, qualifications and limitations to be set forth in the written opinion, the
consideration to be paid by Capital Dynamics pursuant to the Merger Agreement for each Class A share is fair, from a financial point of view to the
Partnership and the Public Shareholders, and (ii) that, following consideration of the uncertainty of the long-term outlook of the Partnership, concerns of
maintaining sustainable distribution growth, the Partnership’s high cost of capital, the fairness opinion of Evercore and the terms and provisions of the
proposed transactions, the GP Conflicts Committee had approved the resolutions described in the preceding paragraph. Thereafter, the members of the
General Partner Board voted unanimously to approve the Transactions and recommend that the shareholders of the Partnership vote in favor of the
Merger and the Merger Agreement. The members of the General Partner Board also approved a waiver from the requirements of the SunPower ROFO
Agreement for all projects still subject thereto during the pendency of the Mergers.

Thereafter, on February 5, 2018, the parties executed the Merger Agreement, the Support Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and issued press
releases announcing the Transactions.

Recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board; Reasons for Recommending Approval of the Merger
Proposals

The GP Conflicts Committee

The GP Conflicts Committee consists of three independent directors: Thomas C. O’Connor, Norman J. Szydlowski and Michael W. Yackira. The
General Partner Board authorized the GP Conflicts Committee to (i) review and evaluate the terms and conditions, and determine the advisability, of the
Mergers on behalf of the Partnership Group and the Public Shareholders, (ii) evaluate the merits of the Mergers relative to the merits of maintaining the
status quo, as the GP Conflicts Committee deems necessary or appropriate, (iii) negotiate on behalf of the Partnership Group and the Public
Shareholders, or delegate the ability to negotiate to any persons, with any party the GP Conflicts Committee deemed appropriate, with respect to the
terms and conditions of the Mergers, (iv) determine whether to give or withhold the GP Conflicts Committee’s approval of the Mergers, including by
“Special Approval” pursuant to Section 7.9(a) of the Partnership Agreement, (v) make a recommendation to the General Partner Board whether to
approve the Mergers, and (vi) if the Mergers were approved by the GP Conflicts Committee, make a recommendation to the Shareholders whether to
approve the Mergers if applicable.

The GP Conflicts Committee retained RL&F as its legal counsel and Evercore as its financial advisor. The GP Conflicts Committee oversaw the
performance of financial and legal due diligence by its advisors, conducted an extensive review and evaluation of the Sponsors’ proposal, evaluated the
merits of the Mergers relative to the merits of maintaining the Partnership’s status quo, and conducted negotiations with the Parent Entities, the Sponsors
and their respective representatives with respect to the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the related documents (the “Transaction
Documents”) and the Transactions.

The GP Conflicts Committee considered the benefits of the Merger Agreement, including the Mergers, as well as the associated risks, and at a
meeting held on February 5, 2018, unanimously (i) determined that the Mergers,

including the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, are advisable, fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, the Partnership Group and the
Public Shareholders, (ii) approved the Mergers, including the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, such approval constituting “Special Approval”
pursuant to Section 7.9(a) of the Partnership Agreement, (iii) recommended to the General Partner Board that the General Partner Board approve the
Mergers and consummate the Transactions on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (iv) recommended to the Public Shareholders that they
approve the Merger Agreement and the Transactions.

The General Partner Board, at a meeting held on February 5, 2018, based in part upon the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee,
unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the General Partner, the Partnership Group, the Shareholders and the holders of OpCo
Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units (such holders of OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units, the “Unitholders”), and declared it
advisable, for the Partnership Entities to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Mergers, (ii) authorized and directed the General Partner
to approve the Merger Agreement and the Mergers in its capacity as the general partner of the Partnership, acting individually and in its capacity as the
managing member of OpCo, to approve the Merger Agreement and the Mergers, (iii) authorized and directed the General Partner to execute and deliver
the Merger Agreement in its individual capacity and on behalf of the Partnership, acting individually and on behalf of OpCo, (iv) authorized and
directed the General Partner to direct the Merger Agreement and the Mergers to be submitted to a vote of the Shareholders (voting as separate classes) at
a meeting in accordance with the Partnership Agreement, (v) authorized and directed the General Partner, upon receipt of the Shareholder Approval, to
obtain the consent of (a) a Unit Majority and (b) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Common Units, voting as a class, in each case in accordance with
the OpCo LLC Agreement and the Partnership Agreement, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Mergers and (vi) determined to
recommend that the Shareholders approve the Merger Agreement and the Mergers.

In reaching its determination, the GP Conflicts Committee viewed the following factors as generally positive or favorable in arriving at its
determinations and recommendation with respect to the Mergers:
 

 
•  The Share Merger Consideration is an all-cash amount, which the GP Conflicts Committee believed provided greater value to the Public

Shareholders than the long-term value of the Partnership as a publicly traded partnership, after taking into account the risks and challenges
facing the Partnership’s current business and financial prospects.

 

 

•  As part of the Share Merger Consideration, Public Shareholders will be entitled to receive the following: (1) if closing of the Partnership
Merger occurs on or prior to May 31, 2018: (A) $0.135 per Class A share, plus (B) the product of the number of days from March 1, 2018
through and including the Closing Date multiplied by $0.0021 per Class A share, or (2) if closing of the Partnership Merger occurs after
May 31, 2018: (A) $0.3282 per Class A share, plus (B) the product of the number of days from June 1, 2018 through and including the
Closing Date multiplied by $0.0045 per Class A share. The GP Conflicts Committee understood that the Partnership will be permitted to pay
distributions between the signing and the Closing, subject to certain permitted increases, and the Share Merger Consideration would be
decreased by the amount of any distributions paid by the Partnership after January 12, 2018.

 

 
•  The GP Conflicts Committee believed that $12.35 per Class A share was Capital Dynamics’ final offer and was the highest price per Class A

share that Capital Dynamics would be willing to pay to the Public Shareholders at the time of the GP Conflicts Committee’s determination
and approval.

 

 

•  The GP Conflicts Committee believed that neither Sponsor would be willing to lower the consideration it receives in the Mergers to benefit
the Public Shareholders, which belief was based on the Sponsors’ rejection of multiple requests by the GP Conflicts Committee that the
Sponsors decrease their Unit Merger Consideration in order to benefit the Public Shareholders. The GP Conflicts Committee also believed
that the negotiated Merger Consideration was based, in part, on concessions made by the Sponsors to Capital Dynamics for no additional
consideration, and that the Sponsors would agree to no further concessions to Capital Dynamics.

 •  The Sponsors are transferring their General Partner Interest and their IDRs in OpCo for no consideration.
 

 
•  The Mergers resulted from a comprehensive process in which the Sponsors and the Partnership contacted or received inbound interest from

over 130 prospective buyers over approximately nine months and entered into non-disclosure agreements with more than 30 prospective
buyers.

 

 
•  Prior to initiating a comprehensive process to contact prospective buyers, each Sponsor publicly announced its intention to explore

alternatives related to its interests in the Partnership.
 

 
•  The potential for downward pressure on the public share price of Class A shares as a result of the Sponsor’s OpCo Subordinated Units

converting into OpCo Common Units (which would be exchangeable for Class A shares in the Partnership) as a result of the expected
expiration of the subordination period in the second half of 2018.

 

 
•  The delivery of an opinion by Evercore to the GP Conflicts Committee on February 5, 2018, that, as of such date and based on and subject

to the assumptions, procedures, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in the opinion, the Share Merger Consideration to be
paid by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Partnership and the Public Shareholders.

 

 
•  The GP Conflicts Committee believed that the Partnership would face significant challenges were it to continue as a public standalone

company, which challenges included, among other things:
 

 

•  The GP Conflicts Committee’s belief that the growth prospects for the Partnership if it continues as a standalone entity are extremely
limited and that it would be challenging for the Partnership to finance the acquisition of additional projects given its current share
price and current debt levels, the rising interest rate environment and restrictions on its business, including restrictions resulting from
its debt obligations.

 

 
•  The risk that the Partnership may not be able to re-finance its debt obligations that come due in calendar year 2020 on favorable

terms.
 

 
•  Management’s view that the Partnership will be required to amortize the principal amount of its debt obligations over the term of any

re-financed debt period, which would likely reduce the Partnership’s cash available for distribution.
 

 

•  The challenges to the Partnership’s ability to acquire additional projects and grow its distribution in light of the Sponsors’ public
announcements that they were exploring alternatives for their investments in the Partnership and the Sponsors’ desire to exit their
investments in the Partnership and therefore remove committed sources of projects that would enable the Partnership’s primary
business objective of generating predictable cash distributions that grow at a sustainable rate.

 

 
•  The evolving nature of the solar industry has enabled the Sponsors to sell projects at an earlier stage of construction and

development than is best suited for the Partnership.
 

 
•  The Mergers being subject to the approval of a majority of the outstanding Class A shares (excluding Class A shares owned by the General

Partner or its affiliates), voting as a class.
 

 
•  The terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement having been determined through extensive arm’s-length negotiations among the

Sponsors, the Partnership, the GP Conflicts Committee, Capital Dynamics and their respective representatives and advisors.
 

 •  Certain terms of the Merger Agreement, principally:
 

 
•  The Partnership’s right, subject to certain conditions, to negotiate certain unsolicited acquisition proposals, and the Partnership’s

ability under certain circumstances to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect
to a Superior Proposal, subject to Parent’s right to receive payment of the Termination Fee of approximately $24.7 million.

Table of Contents

 

•  The provision of the Merger Agreement allowing the GP Conflicts Committee to withdraw its recommendation in specified
circumstances relating to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event (as defined below under “The Merger Agreement—No
Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation”), subject to Parent’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement and receive payment
of the Termination Fee of approximately $24.7 million.

 

 •  The Merger Agreement may not be amended or modified in any respect without the approval of the GP Conflicts Committee.
 

 
•  The agreement by the Sponsors to vote their indirectly owned Class B shares and common and subordinated units in OpCo in favor of the

Merger Agreement and the Transactions.
 

 
•  The Mergers and the Transactions not being conditioned upon Parent’s obtaining sufficient financing and Parent’s having entered into a debt

commitment letter to fund, together with the equity funds available to Parent, the Merger Consideration.
 

 •  The Mergers not being subject to a vote of Parent’s equity owners.
 

 
•  In connection with the consideration of the Mergers, the GP Conflicts Committee retained its own independent financial and legal advisors

with knowledge and experience advising publicly traded companies with respect to transactions similar to the Mergers.
 

 •  The GP Conflicts Committee understood that it had no obligation to approve or recommend any transaction.

In addition, the GP Conflicts Committee considered the following factors to be generally negative or unfavorable in making its determination and
approvals, and the related recommendation to the General Partner Board and the Public Shareholders:
 

 
•  The Share Merger Consideration represents (i) an approximate 13.6% discount to the closing price of the Class A shares as of February 2,

2018, and (ii) an approximate 5.7% discount to the closing price of the Class A shares as of April 4, 2017, which was the closing price on
the day before the Sponsors publicly announced their intention to explore alternatives related to their interests in the Partnership.

 

 
•  The Share Merger Consideration could be decreased below $12.35 as a result of any distributions declared (to the extent the record date has

passed prior to the Closing) or paid by the Partnership after January 12, 2018.
 

 

•  As a result of an agreement between First Solar and SunPower, First Solar will pay certain of the proceeds it receives in the Transactions to
SunPower, which will result in SunPower receiving approximately $13.40 for each OpCo Common Unit and OpCo Subordinated Unit and
First Solar receiving approximately $10.98 for each OpCo Common Unit and OpCo Subordinated Unit. Consequently, the Public
Shareholders will receive less, on a per share/unit basis, than SunPower, although the GP Conflicts Committee recognized the Public
Shareholders would receive more, on a per share/unit basis, than First Solar.

 

 
•  The Sponsors are receiving the Unit Merger Consideration, which is identical to the Share Merger Consideration, notwithstanding the fact

that the subordinated units of OpCo are subordinated with respect to distributions and are not currently exchangeable into Class A shares
which are freely-tradeable on a public securities exchange.

 

 
•  The Class A shares are currently, and have in the past, traded at levels that exceed the Share Merger Consideration that each Public

Shareholder will be entitled to receive. The 52-week high for the Class A shares as of February 2, 2018 was $15.90.
 

 
•  The Public Shareholders will not have any equity participation in the Partnership or Parent or any of its affiliates following the OpCo

Mergers Effective Time and Partnership Merger Effective Time, and the Public Shareholders will accordingly cease to participate in the
Partnership’s future earnings or growth, if any, or to benefit from increases, if any, in the value of the Class A shares.

Table of Contents

 
•  The Partnership Merger will be a taxable transaction to the Public Shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which will generally

cause Public Shareholders who have tax gain in their Class A shares to incur a tax liability.
 

 
•  The GP Conflicts Committee was not authorized to, and did not, conduct its own independent auction process or other solicitation of interest

from third parties for the acquisition of the Partnership.
 

 •  Certain terms of the Merger Agreement, principally:
 

 •  the provisions limiting the ability of the Partnership to solicit, or to consider unsolicited, offers from third parties for the Partnership;
 

 •  the Termination Fee payable by OpCo to Parent in connection with termination of the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances;
 

 
•  the expense reimbursement payable by OpCo to Parent in connection with termination of the Merger Agreement in certain

circumstances; and
 

 
•  if there is a failure of Parent’s Debt Financing (as defined below), Parent could refuse to close the Mergers notwithstanding the

satisfaction of all of the closing conditions, in which case Parent would be obligated to pay a termination fee to OpCo of
approximately $54.3 million (the “Parent Termination Fee”).

 

 
•  The Mergers may not be completed in a timely manner, or at all, and a failure to complete the Mergers could result in significant costs and

disruption to the Partnership’s normal business and negatively affect the trading price of the Class A shares.
 

 
•  Litigation may be commenced in connection with the Mergers or the Transactions, and such litigation may increase costs and result in a

diversion of management focus.
 

 
•  The Public Shareholders are not entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights under the Merger Agreement, the Partnership Agreement or

Delaware law.
 

 
•  The Sponsors and certain members of the Partnership’s management or General Partner Board may have interests in the Mergers that are

different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Partnership’s Public Shareholders.

After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the GP Conflicts Committee concluded that the potential benefits of
the Mergers outweighed any negative or unfavorable considerations and determined that that it is advisable, fair and reasonable to, and in the best
interests of, the Partnership Group and the Public Shareholders for the Partnership to enter into the Transaction Documents and consummate the
Mergers.

The foregoing discussion is not intended to be exhaustive, but is intended to address material information and principal factors considered by the
GP Conflicts Committee. In view of the number and variety of factors and the amount and complexity of information considered, the GP Conflicts
Committee did not find it practicable or useful to, and did not make specific assessments of, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to, the specific
factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, the GP Conflicts Committee did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination, and
individual members of the GP Conflicts Committee may have given different weights to different factors. The GP Conflicts Committee made its
recommendation based on the totality of information presented to, and the investigation conducted by, the GP Conflicts Committee. It should be noted
that certain statements and other information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors
discussed under the heading “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

The General Partner Board

The General Partner Board consists of seven directors, three of whom are independent (Messrs. O’Connor, Szydlowski and Yackira), one of whom
is the Chief Executive Officer of the General Partner and a designee of

the Sponsors (Mr. Boynton) and three of whom are also designees of the Sponsors (Messrs. Widmar and Bradley and Ms. Jackson). As such, certain
members of the General Partner Board may have different interests in the Partnership Merger than do the Shareholders. For a complete discussion of
these and other interests of the members of the General Partner Board in the Mergers, see “—Interests of Certain Persons in the Mergers.” Because of
such possible and actual conflicts of interest, the General Partner Board delegated to the GP Conflicts Committee the full power and authority of the
General Partner Board to (i) review and evaluate the terms and conditions, and determine the advisability, of the Mergers on behalf of the Partnership
Group and the Public Shareholders, (ii) evaluate the merits of the Mergers relative to the merits of maintaining the status quo, as the GP Conflicts
Committee deems necessary or appropriate, (iii) negotiate on behalf of the Partnership Group and the Public Shareholders, or delegate the ability to
negotiate to any persons, with any party the GP Conflicts Committee deemed appropriate, with respect to the terms and conditions of the Mergers,
(iv) determine whether to give or withhold the GP Conflicts Committee’s approval of the Mergers, including by “Special Approval” pursuant to
Section 7.9(a) of the Partnership Agreement, (v) make a recommendation to the General Partner Board whether to approve the Mergers, and (vi) if the
Mergers were approved by the GP Conflicts Committee, make a recommendation to the Shareholders whether to approve the Mergers if applicable.

The GP Conflicts Committee considered the benefits of the Merger Agreement, including the Mergers, as well as the associated risks, and at a
meeting held on February 5, 2018, unanimously (i) determined that the Mergers, including the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, are advisable,
fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, the Partnership Group and the Public Shareholders, (ii) approved the Mergers, including the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions, such approval constituting “Special Approval” pursuant to Section 7.9(a) of the Partnership Agreement,
(iii) recommended to the General Partner Board that the General Partner Board approve the Mergers and consummate the Transactions on the terms set
forth in the Merger Agreement and (iv) recommended to the Public Shareholders that the Public Shareholders approve the Merger Agreement and the
Mergers.

Later that day, the General Partner Board, acting based in part upon the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee, unanimously
(i) determined that it is in the best interests of the General Partner, the Partnership Group, the Shareholders and the Unitholders, and declared it
advisable, for the Partnership Entities to enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the Mergers, (ii) authorized and directed the General
Partner, in its capacity as the general partner of the Partnership, acting individually and in its capacity as the managing member of OpCo, to approve the
Merger Agreement and the Mergers, (iii) authorized and directed the General Partner to execute and deliver the Merger Agreement in its individual
capacity and on behalf of the Partnership, acting individually and on behalf of OpCo, (iv) authorized and directed the General Partner to direct the
Merger Agreement and the Mergers to be submitted to a vote of the Shareholders (voting as separate classes) at a meeting in accordance with the
Partnership Agreement, (v) authorized and directed the General Partner, upon receipt of the Shareholder Approval, to obtain the consent of (a) a Unit
Majority and (b) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Common Units, voting as a class, in each case in accordance with the OpCo LLC Agreement and
the Partnership Agreement, to enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Mergers and (vi) determined to recommend that the Shareholders
approve the Merger Agreement and the Mergers.

The General Partner Board considered a number of factors, including the following material factors:
 

 •  the unanimous determinations and recommendations of the GP Conflicts Committee;
 

 
•  the factors considered by the GP Conflicts Committee, including the material factors considered by the GP Conflicts Committee described

under “—The GP Conflicts Committee” above;
 

 
•  the belief that the Partnership’s current cost of capital relative to the market and inability to access the capital markets on a consistent basis

would hinder the Partnership’s growth prospects and would make it unlikely that the Partnership could acquire projects; and
 

 
•  the current price of the Class A shares would create difficulties in financing accretive acquisitions and any failure of the Partnership’s

acquired solar energy projects to be accretive could have a material

 adverse effect on the Partnership’s ability to grow its business and make increased cash distributions to Shareholders.

In doing so, the General Partner Board conducted its review of factors it has determined to be relevant, including the analysis, recommendations
and approval of the GP Conflicts Committee, which is discussed above.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the General Partner Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes
material factors the General Partner Board considered. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Mergers and
the complexity of these matters, the General Partner Board did not find it useful and did not attempt to quantify or assign any relative or specific weights
to the various factors considered in making its determination and recommendation. In addition, each of the members of the General Partner Board may
have given differing weights to different factors.

Recommendation

Each of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board recommends that the Shareholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposals.

Opinion of the GP Conflicts Committee’s Financial Advisor

Introduction

The GP Conflicts Committee retained Evercore as its financial advisor with respect to the provision of (i) financial advisory services to the GP
Conflicts Committee and (ii) an opinion to the GP Conflicts Committee as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Share Merger
Consideration to the Partnership and the Public Shareholders. At the request of the GP Conflicts Committee at a meeting of the GP Conflicts Committee
held on February 5, 2018, Evercore rendered its oral opinion to the GP Conflicts Committee that, as of February 5, 2018, based upon and subject to the
assumptions, procedures, qualifications, limitations and other matters considered by Evercore in connection with the preparation of its opinion, the
Share Merger Consideration to be paid by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Partnership and the
Public Shareholders. Evercore subsequently confirmed its oral opinion in a written opinion on the same date.

Evercore’s opinion speaks only as of the date it was delivered and not as of the time the Partnership Merger will be completed or any other date.
The opinion does not reflect changes that may occur or may have occurred after February 5, 2018, which could alter the facts and circumstances on
which Evercore’s opinion was based. It is understood that subsequent events may affect Evercore’s opinion, but Evercore does not have any obligation
to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

Evercore’s opinion was directed to the GP Conflicts Committee (in its capacity as such), and only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of
view, as of February 5, 2018, of the Share Merger Consideration to the Partnership and the Public Shareholders. Evercore’s opinion did not address any
other term or aspect of the Partnership Merger. The full text of the written opinion that describes the assumptions made, procedures followed,
qualifications and limitations of the review undertaken, and other matters considered by Evercore in rendering its opinion, is attached hereto
as Annex B. The summary of Evercore’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
written opinion. However, neither the written opinion nor the summary of such opinion and the related analyses set forth in this proxy
statement are intended to be, and they do not constitute, a recommendation as to how Shareholders or any other person should act or vote with
respect to the Partnership Merger or any other matter.

Evercore’s opinion to the GP Conflicts Committee was among several factors taken into consideration by the GP Conflicts Committee in making
its recommendation to the board of directors of the General Partner regarding the Partnership Merger.

Table of Contents

In connection with rendering its opinion and performing its related financial analysis, Evercore, among other things:
 

 
•  reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to the Partnership and OpCo that Evercore deemed

to be relevant, including the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016 and certain Current
Reports on Form 8-K, in each case, as filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Partnership since December 1, 2016;

 

 
•  reviewed certain non-public historical financial and operating data relating to the Partnership and OpCo provided to Evercore by

management of the Partnership;
 

 
•  reviewed certain non-public projected financial and operating data relating to the Partnership and OpCo that were provided to Evercore by

management of the Partnership and a sensitivity case prepared by Evercore that was recommended by and developed utilizing assistance and
certain assumptions from management of the Partnership;

 

 
•  discussed the historical and current operations, financial projections and current financial condition of the Partnership and OpCo with

management of the Partnership (including such management’s views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving such projections);
 

 •  reviewed publicly available research analyst estimates for the Partnership’s future financial performance on a standalone basis;
 

 
•  performed discounted cash flow analyses based on projected financial data and other data of the Partnership and OpCo provided by

management of the Partnership;
 

 •  reviewed the reported prices and historical trading activity of the Class A shares;
 

 
•  compared the financial performance of the Partnership with the stock market trading multiples of certain publicly traded companies that

Evercore deemed relevant based on various metrics;
 

 •  reviewed certain historical transactions that Evercore deemed relevant;
 

 •  reviewed a draft, dated February 5, 2018, of the Merger Agreement; and
 

 
•  performed such other analyses and examinations, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Evercore deemed

appropriate for purposes of providing the opinion.

For purposes of Evercore’s analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon, without undertaking any independent verification of, the
accuracy and completeness of all of the information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed
with, or reviewed by Evercore, and Evercore assumes no liability therefor. With respect to the projected financial and operating data relating to the
Partnership and OpCo referred to above, Evercore assumed that such data were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and good faith judgments of management of the Partnership as to the future financial performance of the Partnership and OpCo, as applicable,
under the business assumptions reflected therein. Evercore did not express a view as to any projected financial and operating data or any judgments,
estimates or assumptions on which they are based. Evercore relied, at the GP Conflicts Committee’s direction, without independent verification, upon
the assessments of the management of the Partnership as to the future financial and operating performance of the Partnership and OpCo. In addition,
Evercore did not produce any retail or wholesale market electricity forecasts and is not an expert in such and relied, with the GP Conflicts Committee’s
consent, upon electricity forecasts provided by management of the Partnership.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the Merger Agreement and related documents
that were reviewed by Evercore would be executed and delivered (in the draft form reviewed by Evercore), that the representations and warranties of
each party contained in the Merger Agreement (in the draft form reviewed by Evercore) would be true and correct, that each party will perform all of the
covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the Partnership
Merger and the related transactions in the Merger

Agreement will be satisfied without material waiver or modification thereof. Evercore further assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other
consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Partnership Merger and the related transactions in the Merger Agreement will be
obtained without any material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Partnership or the Public Shareholders
or the consummation of the Partnership Merger and the related transactions in the Merger Agreement or materially reduce the benefits of the Partnership
Merger to the Public Shareholders.

Evercore did not make nor assume any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the
Partnership or OpCo, nor was Evercore furnished with any such appraisals, nor did Evercore evaluate the solvency or fair value of the Partnership or
OpCo under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore’s opinion was necessarily based upon information
made available to Evercore as of the date of its opinion and financial, economic, monetary, market, regulatory and other conditions and circumstances as
they existed and as could be evaluated by Evercore as of the date of its opinion. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect Evercore’s
opinion and that Evercore does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

The estimates contained in Evercore’s analyses and the results from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of future results, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or assets neither
purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or assets may actually be sold. Accordingly, Evercore’s analyses
and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

In arriving at its opinion, Evercore did not attribute any particular weight to any particular analysis or factor considered by it, but rather made
qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Several analytical methodologies were employed by Evercore in
its analyses, and no one single method of analysis should be regarded as determinative of the overall conclusion reached by Evercore. Each analytical
technique has inherent strengths and weaknesses, and the nature of the available information may further affect the significance of particular techniques.
Accordingly, Evercore believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and of the factors considered
by it, without considering all analyses and factors in their entirety, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its
opinion. The conclusion reached by Evercore, therefore, is based on the application of Evercore’s experience and judgment to all analyses and factors
considered by Evercore, taken as a whole.

Evercore was not asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than whether the Share Merger Consideration is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the Partnership and the Public Shareholders. Evercore’s opinion did not express any opinion as to the structure,
terms (other than the Share Merger Consideration) or effect or any other aspect of the Partnership Merger, including, without limitation, the tax
consequences of the Partnership Merger. Evercore did not express any view on, and its opinion does not address, the fairness of the Unit Merger
Consideration to, or any consideration paid or received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other securities, creditors or other constituencies
of the Partnership or its affiliates nor any view as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers,
directors or employees of the Partnership or its affiliates, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Share Merger Consideration or otherwise.
Evercore assumed that any modification to the structure of the Partnership Merger and the related transactions in the Merger Agreement will not vary in
any respect material to its analysis. Evercore’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the Partnership Merger as compared to other business or
financial strategies that might have been available to the Partnership, nor did it address the underlying business decision of the Partnership to engage in
the Partnership Merger. In arriving at its opinion, Evercore was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any third party with respect to
the acquisition of any or all of the limited partner interests in the Partnership or any business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving
the Partnership. Evercore’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to the GP Conflicts Committee or to any other persons in respect of the
Partnership Merger, including as to how any holders of Class A shares should vote or act in respect of the Partnership Merger. Evercore expressed no
opinion as to the price at which the Class A shares will trade at any time. Evercore is not a

legal, regulatory, accounting or tax expert and assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by the Partnership and its advisors with respect to
legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Evercore in connection with the preparation of its opinion and
reviewed with the GP Conflicts Committee on February 5, 2018. Unless the context indicates otherwise, enterprise values and equity values used in the
selected partnerships and corporations analysis described below were calculated using the closing price of the selected partnerships and corporations
listed below as of February 2, 2018, and transaction values for the selected transactions analysis described below were calculated on an enterprise value
basis based on the value of the equity consideration and other public information available at the time of the relevant transaction’s announcement. The
analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed, the tables
must be considered together with the textual summary of the analyses.

No entity or transaction used in the analyses of entities or transactions summarized below is identical or directly comparable to the Partnership or
the Partnership Merger. As a consequence, mathematical derivations (such as the high, low, mean and median) of financial data are not by themselves
meaningful, and these analyses must take into account differences in the financial and operating characteristics of the selected entities and differences in
the structure and timing of the selected transactions and other factors that would affect the public trading value and acquisition value of the entities
considered.

Projections

See “—Certain Financial Projections” for a description of certain non-public historical and projected financial and operating data and
assumptions, relating to the Partnership, prepared and furnished to Evercore by management of the Partnership and a sensitivity case prepared by
Evercore that was recommended by and developed utilizing assistance and certain assumptions from management of the Partnership.

Analysis of the Partnership

Evercore performed a series of analyses to derive indicative valuation ranges for the Partnership’s Class A shares and applied each of the resulting
implied valuation ranges to derive a range of implied values of the Partnership’s Class A shares and compared these values to the Share Merger
Consideration.

Evercore performed its analyses utilizing financial projections for the Partnership as provided by the Partnership’s management and as adjusted to
reflect a going concern scenario per Partnership management’s recommendations, which financial projections are referred to as the “8point3 Financial
Projections – Base Case.” Evercore also utilized a sensitivity case in its analysis, which is referred to as the “8point3 Financial Projections – MD Solar
Merchant Sensitivity,” that contemplates a scenario wherein the Partnership’s Maryland Solar Project sells all of its generation on a merchant basis
beginning in 2018 and which was developed under the Partnership’s management’s recommendation and assistance and which utilizes assumptions
provided by the Partnership’s management. The Partnership’s management provided information to, and answered the questions of, Evercore during the
performance of Evercore’s analyses, including the preparation of 8point3 Financial Projections – MD Solar Merchant Sensitivity, but did not review or
evaluate the results of such analyses.

Levered Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Evercore performed a levered discounted cash flow analysis of the Partnership by valuing the after-tax free cash flows to be received by the
Partnership based on the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case and the 8point3 Financial Projections – MD Solar Merchant Sensitivity. In addition,
Evercore performed the levered discounted cash flow analysis sensitizing (i) the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case’s forward price curve for
merchant power for a 10.0% increase and a 10.0% decrease (the “Merchant Price Curve Sensitivity”) and (ii) the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base
Case’s total projected generation for a 5.0% increase and a 5.0% decrease (the “Generation Sensitivity”). The Partnership’s after-tax free cash flows to
equity reflect the use by

Table of Contents

the Partnership of net operating losses to offset taxable income and are equivalent to the Cash Available for Distribution as defined and set forth in the
following section of this document entitled “Certain Financial Projections.” Evercore calculated the per share value range for the Partnership’s Class A
shares by utilizing a range of discount rates with a mid-point equal to the Partnership’s cost of equity, as estimated by Evercore based on the Capital
Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”). Evercore assumed a range of discount rates of 6.0% to 8.0%. The applicable tax rate was assumed to be 27.2%, per
management of the Partnership.

Evercore’s levered discounted cash flow analysis for the Partnership resulted in implied equity value per share ranges of $10.53 per share to
$12.44 per share based on the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case, $10.13 per share to $12.03 per share based on the 8point3 Financial
Projections – MD Solar Merchant Sensitivity Case, $10.35 per share to $12.72 per share based on the Merchant Price Curve Sensitivity, and $9.54 per
share to $13.59 per share based on the Generation Sensitivity.

Unlevered Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Evercore performed an unlevered discounted cash flow analysis of the Partnership by valuing the unlevered after-tax free cash flows to be
received by the Partnership based on the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case and the 8point3 Financial Projections – MD Solar Merchant
Sensitivity. In addition, Evercore performed the unlevered discounted cash flow analysis under the assumptions of (i) the Merchant Price Curve
Sensitivity and (ii) the Generation Sensitivity. The Partnership’s unlevered free cash flows reflect the use by the Partnership of net operating losses to
offset taxable income and are equivalent to the Unlevered Free Cash Flow as defined and set forth in the following section of this document entitled
“Certain Financial Projections.” Evercore calculated the per share value range for the Partnership’s Class A shares by utilizing a range of discount rates
with a mid-point equal to the Partnership’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), as estimated by Evercore based on CAPM and assuming that
22.2% of the Partnership’s total capitalization is comprised of debt with a time-weighted, after-tax cost of 3.28%. Evercore assumed a range of discount
rates of 5.0% to 7.0%. The applicable tax rate was assumed to be 27.2%, per management of the Partnership.

Evercore’s unlevered discounted cash flow analysis for the Partnership resulted in implied equity value per share ranges of $9.81 per share to
$13.13 per share based on the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case, $9.43 per share to $12.73 per share based on the 8point3 Financial Projections
– MD Solar Merchant Sensitivity Case, $9.58 per share to $13.48 per share based on the Merchant Price Curve Sensitivity, and $8.76 per share to
$14.38 per share based on the Generation Sensitivity.

Peer Group Trading Analysis

Evercore performed a peer group trading analysis of the Partnership by reviewing and comparing the market values and trading multiples of the
following renewable power dividend growth-oriented public companies commonly referred to as “YieldCos” (“YieldCos”) that Evercore deemed to
have certain characteristics that are similar to those of the Partnership:

US YieldCos:
 

 •  NextEra Energy Partners LP
 

 •  Pattern Energy Group Inc.

Canadian YieldCos:
 

 •  Brookfield Renewable Partners LP
 

 •  Northland Power Inc.
 

 •  TransAlta Renewables Inc.
 

 •  Innergex Renewable Energy Inc.

Table of Contents

International YieldCos:
 

 •  Atlantica Yield plc

YieldCos Under Sale Process:
 

 •  NRG Yield Inc.

Although the peer group was compared to the Partnership for purposes of this analysis, no partnership or corporation used in the peer group
analysis is identical or directly comparable to the Partnership. In order to calculate peer group trading multiples, Evercore relied on publicly available
filings with the SEC and other regulatory agencies and equity research analyst estimates.

For each of the peer group partnerships or corporations, Evercore calculated the following trading multiples:
 

 •  Enterprise Value / 2018 EBITDA, which is defined as Enterprise Value divided by estimated EBITDA for the calendar year 2018; and
 

 
•  Current Annualized Dividend Yield, which is defined as the most recently declared quarterly distribution annualized divided by current

share price.

The mean and median trading multiples are set forth below. The table also includes relevant multiple ranges selected by Evercore based on the
resulting range of multiples and certain other considerations related to the specific characteristics of the Partnership noted by Evercore.
 

Benchmark (US YieldCos)   Mean    Median 
Enterprise Value / 2018 EBITDA    11.6x    11.6x 
Current Annualized Dividend Yield    6.0%    6.0% 

 
Benchmark (Canadian YieldCos)   Mean    Median 
Enterprise Value / 2018 EBITDA    12.1x    12.7x 
Current Annualized Dividend Yield    6.0%    5.6% 

 
Benchmark (Based on US and Canadian YieldCos)   

Reference
Range  

Enterprise Value / 2018 EBITDA    11.0x – 13.0x 
Current Annualized Dividend Yield    8.0% – 5.0% 

Evercore applied the Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiple reference ranges illustrated above to estimated 2018 EBITDA from the 8point3
Financial Projections – Base Case. Evercore determined an implied equity value per share range by utilizing the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base
Case of $9.38 per share to $12.66 per share.

Evercore applied the current annualized dividend yield reference ranges illustrated above to current annualized dividend per share, as announced
by the Partnership in a press release on December 20, 2017. Evercore determined an implied equity value per share range by utilizing this current
annualized dividend per share of $14.01 per share to $22.42 per share.

Evercore also applied the current annualized dividend yield reference ranges illustrated above to estimated 2018 – 2022 average implied dividend
per share from the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case. Evercore determined an implied equity value per share range by utilizing this estimated
2018 – 2022 average implied dividend per share of $11.66 per share to $18.66 per share.

Precedent M&A Transaction Analysis

Evercore reviewed the EBITDA multiples paid in the selected historical transactions and derived a range of relevant implied multiples of
transaction value to EBITDA of 10.0x to 12.0x for 2018 EBITDA for its precedent transactions analysis. Evercore then applied this range of selected
multiples to estimated 2018 EBITDA from the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case. Evercore determined an implied equity value per share range
of $7.75 per share to $11.02 per share.

Evercore reviewed the cash available for distribution yield paid in the selected historical transactions and derived a range of relevant implied
yields of 10.0% to 8.5% for its precedent transactions analysis. Evercore then applied this range of selected yields to estimated 2018 – 2022 average
corporate cash available for distribution from the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case. Evercore determined an implied equity value per share
range of $10.98 per share to $12.91 per share.

General

Evercore and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for their own accounts and the accounts of customers. In connection with these
businesses or otherwise, Evercore and its affiliates and/or their respective employees, as well as investment vehicles in which any of them may have a
financial interest, may at any time, directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions and may trade or otherwise effect transactions for their own
accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products relating to the Partnership and its respective
affiliates, for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or
instruments.

The GP Conflicts Committee selected Evercore to provide financial advice in connection with its evaluation of the Partnership Merger because of,
among other reasons, Evercore’s experience, reputation and familiarity

with the solar sector of the energy industry and because its investment banking professionals have substantial experience in transactions similar to the
Partnership Merger.

The description set forth above constitutes a summary of the analyses employed and factors considered by Evercore in rendering its opinion to the
GP Conflicts Committee. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex, analytical process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.

Pursuant to the terms of the engagement of Evercore, Evercore will receive a fee of $1,650,000 for its services, of which $200,000 became
payable upon the execution of its engagement letter, $550,000 became payable upon delivery of the opinion and $900,000 will become payable upon the
Closing of the Partnership Merger. In addition, the Partnership has agreed to reimburse certain of Evercore’s expenses and to indemnify Evercore against
certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.

During the two year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed between Evercore or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and
the Partnership or any of its respective affiliates, on the other hand, pursuant to which compensation was or is intended to be received by Evercore or its
affiliates as a result of such a relationship except with respect to (a) Evercore’s opinion and work performed for the GP Conflicts Committee in
connection with the GP Conflicts Committee’s consideration of the Partnership’s acquisition of (i) interests in the Henrietta Project from SunPower,
(ii) the Stateline Project in California from First Solar and subsidiaries of SunPower and (iii) FSAM Kingbird Solar Holdings, LLC from a subsidiary of
SunPower and (b) Evercore’s work performed for the GP Conflicts Committee in connection with other potential acquisitions by the Partnership of
certain assets from SunPower, First Solar and their respective affiliates. For each of the engagements described in this paragraph Evercore received fees
and reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses. Evercore may provide financial or other services to the Partnership in the future and in connection
with any such services Evercore may receive compensation.

Certain Financial Projections

The Partnership does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose long-term financial projections because of, among other reasons, the uncertainty
of the underlying assumptions and estimates and the unpredictability of its business and competitive markets in which it operates. While the Partnership
prepares forecasts annually for internal budgeting and business planning purposes, such forecasts generally focus on the current fiscal year and the
immediately following fiscal year. However, in connection with the evaluation of a potential transaction, the Partnership provided multi-year projections
to prospective strategic and financial participants in connection with their due diligence review and to Evercore and the GP Conflicts Committee in
connection with their consideration of the Mergers.

The summary financial projections included in this proxy statement should not be regarded as predictive of actual future results nor should they be
construed as financial guidance. The summary of the financial projections is not intended to influence or induce any Shareholder to vote in favor of the
Merger Proposals but has been included solely because these financial projections were made available to the GP Conflicts Committee and used by
Evercore in connection with the rendering of its fairness opinion to the GP Conflicts Committee and performing its related financial analyses, as
described in the section entitled “—Opinion of the GP Conflicts Committee’s Financial Advisor.”

The financial projections were prepared for prospective strategic and financial participants and the GP Conflicts Committee and the General
Partner Board in connection with the proposed transactions. The Partnership has not updated, and does not intend to update or otherwise revise, the
projections or the prospective financial information contained therein to reflect circumstances existing or arising since their preparation, including any
changes in general economic or industry conditions, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The projections and the prospective financial
information contained therein do not necessarily reflect current estimates or assumptions management of the General Partner may have about prospects
for the

Partnership’s business, changes in general business or economic conditions, or any other transaction, event or circumstance that has occurred or that may
occur and that was not anticipated, or that has occurred or that may occur differently than as anticipated, at the time the projections or any of the
prospective financial information contained therein were prepared. Neither the Partnership nor any of its affiliates, advisors, directors, officers,
employees, agents or representatives has made or makes any representation or warranty to any shareholder of the Partnership or other person regarding
the ultimate performance of the Partnership compared to the information contained in the prospective financial information or that the projections will
be achieved.

The Partnership’s financial projections are subjective in many respects. There can be no assurance that these financial projections will be realized
or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than forecasted. In addition, the financial projections were not prepared with a view toward
public disclosure or toward complying with GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the use of non-GAAP financial
measures or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to preparation or presentation of
prospective financial information, but, in the view of management, was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and
judgments, and presents, to the best of the Partnership’s management’s knowledge and belief, the Partnership’s expected future financial performance.
However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forecasted financial information.

The prospective financial information included in this proxy statement has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, the Partnership’s
management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the
accompanying prospective financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of
assurance with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to the Partnership’s
previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.

In developing the financial projections, the Partnership made numerous material assumptions with respect to its business for the periods covered
by the projections. The Partnership developed the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case based on the performance of its current portfolio of
financial projections, and the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case assumptions included, but were not limited to, the following:
 

 •  terms of existing offtake agreements and contracts with residential customers;
 

 •  project useful life and solar power generation at each project;
 

 •  merchant solar power pricing after expiration of existing offtake agreements;
 

 
•  operations and maintenance services and asset management costs based on existing O&M Agreements (as defined below) and asset

management agreements;
 

 •  schedule of reimbursement of network upgrade costs;
 

 •  operating costs, general and administrative costs and maintenance capital expenditure;
 

 •  average default rate of contracts in the residential portfolio;
 

 •  distributions from unconsolidated affiliates to the Partnership;
 

 •  payments under existing tax equity financing agreements;
 

 •  no additional acquisition of new solar projects after completion of the Stateline acquisition;
 

 •  utilization of deferred tax assets; and
 

 •  other general business, market, industry, commodity pricing and interest rate assumptions.

In addition to performing its analyses using the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case, Evercore utilized a sensitivity case in its analysis. In
particular, the sensitivity was adjusted for the underlying assumptions

affecting the Partnership’s Maryland Solar Project. If not explicitly stated to the contrary, the underlying assumptions in the 8point3 Financial
Projections – Base Case remained intact in the sensitivity case.

The adjustments to the 8point3 Financial Projections – Base Case for the Maryland Solar Merchant Sensitivity were based on the following
recommendations by the Partnership’s management:
 

 
•  with respect to the Maryland Solar Project, termination of the current power purchase agreement with FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. as of

January 1, 2018; and
 

 
•  with respect to the Maryland Solar Project, merchant power generation, renewable energy credit, and PJM capacity sales from 2018E to

2047E, in each case, based on third-party forecasts provided to Evercore by the management of the Partnership.

Important factors that may affect actual results and cause these financial projections not to be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and
uncertainties relating to the Partnership’s business, industry performance, general business and economic conditions, the regulatory environment and
other factors described in or referenced under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and those risks and uncertainties detailed
in the Partnership’s public filings with the SEC. In addition, the projections also reflect assumptions that are subject to change and do not reflect revised
prospects for the Partnership’s business, changes in general business or economic conditions or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that
may occur and that was not anticipated at the time the financial projections were prepared. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that these financial
projections will be realized or that the Partnership’s future financial results will not materially vary from these financial projections. No one has made or
makes any representation to any Shareholder regarding the information included in the financial projections set forth below. The Partnership has made
no representation to the Parent Entities in the Merger Agreement concerning these or any financial projections.

Definitions of Certain Financial Terms

Adjusted EBITDA

The Partnership defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest expense, net of interest income, income tax provision, depreciation,
amortization and accretion, including the Partnership’s proportionate share of net interest expense, interest income, income taxes and depreciation,
amortization and accretion from its unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, and share-based compensation and
transaction costs incurred for its acquisitions of projects; and excluding the effect of certain other non-cash or non-recurring items that the Partnership
does not consider to be indicative of its ongoing operating performance such as, but not limited to, mark to market adjustments to the fair value of
derivatives related to its interest rate hedges. Adjusted EBITDA is not a United States generally accepted accounting principle (“U.S. GAAP”) financial
measure. This measurement is not recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of
performance. The U.S. GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA
should not be construed as an inference that the Partnership’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

The Partnership believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating its operating performance because securities analysts and other
interested parties use such calculations as a measure of financial performance and borrowers’ ability to service debt. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is
used by the Partnership’s management for internal planning purposes including certain aspects of its consolidated operating budget and capital
expenditures. It is also used by investors to assess the ability of the Partnership’s assets to generate sufficient cash flows to make distributions to the
Shareholders.

However, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool because it does not reflect the Partnership’s cash expenditures or future
requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital, does not reflect
significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Partnership’s outstanding debt or cash
distributions on tax equity, does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes, and excludes the effect of certain other cash flow
items, all of which could have a material effect on the Partnership’s financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S.
GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measure determined in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Partnership’s cash needs. In addition, the Partnership’s calculations of Adjusted EBITDA are
not necessarily comparable to EBITDA as calculated by other companies. Investors should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP
measure, including net income (loss).

Unlevered Free Cash Flow

The Partnership defines Unlevered Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, cash income taxes
paid, maintenance capital expenditures, cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and principal amortization payments on any project-level
indebtedness plus cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, indemnity payments and promissory notes from Sponsors, test electricity generation,
cash proceeds from sales-type residential leases, state and local rebates and cash proceeds for reimbursable network upgrade costs. The Partnership’s
cash flow is generated from distributions it receives from OpCo each quarter. OpCo’s cash flow is generated primarily from distributions from the
Partnership’s subsidiary project entities. As a result, the Partnership’s ability to make distributions to Shareholders depends primarily on the ability of
such project entities to make cash distributions to OpCo and the ability of OpCo to make cash distributions to its unitholders.

Table of Contents

The Partnership believes that unlevered free cash flow is useful to evaluate the future performance of the Partnership independent of the
Partnership’s capital structure. However, unlevered free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool because, among other items, it does not reflect the
Partnership’s cost of capital. Unlevered free cash flow is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or
any other performance measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Partnership’s cash needs. In
addition, the Partnership’s calculations of unlevered free cash flow are not necessarily comparable to unlevered free cash flow as calculated by other
companies. Investors should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP measure.

Cash Available for Distribution

The Partnership uses cash available for distribution, which the Partnership defines as Adjusted EBITDA less equity in earnings of unconsolidated
affiliates, cash interest paid, cash income taxes paid, maintenance capital expenditures, cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and principal
amortization payments on any corporate or project-level indebtedness plus cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates, indemnity payments and
promissory notes from Sponsors, test electricity generation, cash proceeds from sales-type residential leases, state and local rebates and cash proceeds
for reimbursable network upgrade costs. The Partnership’s cash flow is generated from distributions it receives from OpCo each quarter. OpCo’s cash
flow is generated primarily from distributions from the Partnership’s subsidiary project entities. As a result, the Partnership’s ability to make
distributions to Shareholders depends primarily on the ability of such project entities to make cash distributions to OpCo and the ability of OpCo to
make cash distributions to its unitholders.

The Partnership believes cash available for distribution is useful to investors in evaluating the Partnership’s operating performance because
securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of the Partnership’s ability to generate sustainable distributions. In
addition, when evaluating a potential acquisition, the Partnership’s management team projects expected cash available for distribution to determine
whether to make such acquisition. The U.S. GAAP measure most directly comparable to cash available for distribution is net income (loss).

However, cash available for distribution has limitations as an analytical tool because it does not capture the level of capital expenditures necessary
to maintain the operating performance of the Partnership’s projects, does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and excludes the effect of
certain other cash flow items, all of which could have a material effect on the Partnership’s financial condition and results from operations. Cash
available for distribution is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance
measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Partnership’s cash needs. In addition, the
Partnership’s calculations of cash available for distribution are not necessarily comparable to cash available for distribution as calculated by other
companies. Investors should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP measure, including net income (loss).

Interests of Certain Persons in the Mergers

In considering the recommendations of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board with respect to the Merger Agreement and the
Mergers, the Shareholders should be aware that certain of the current directors and executive officers of the General Partner and their affiliates have
interests in the Mergers that differ from, or are in addition to, the interests of the Shareholders generally. The Shareholders should take these interests
into account in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the Merger Proposals. These interests are described in more detail below.

Interests of the Sponsors

The Sponsors have a significant interest in the Partnership and OpCo through their collective indirect ownership of 100.0% of the Class B shares,
approximately 35.6% of the OpCo Common Units and 100% of the

Table of Contents

OpCo Subordinated Units. First Solar owns 6,721,810 OpCo Common Units and 15,395,115 OpCo Subordinated Units, all of which will be canceled
upon the Closing and converted into the right to receive the Unit Merger Consideration. SunPower owns 8,778,190 OpCo Common Units and
20,104,884 OpCo Subordinated Units, all of which will be canceled upon the Closing and represent the right to receive the Unit Merger Consideration.
Additionally, each of First Solar and SunPower owns a 50% voting and economic interest in Holdings, which owns the General Partner Interest and the
IDRs in OpCo. The Sponsors are transferring their ownership of the General Partner Interest and the IDRs for no consideration.

Beginning after November 30, 2019, the economic interests of Holdings owned by the Sponsors will be subject to adjustment annually based on
the performance of the Partnership’s subsidiary project entities and any additional assets contributed to OpCo by such Sponsor against the performance
of all the Partnership’s subsidiary project entities and all additional assets held by OpCo. The percentage of the aggregate economic interests held by
each Sponsor after adjustment will equal the percentage arrived at by dividing (i) the cash generated and distributed, subject to certain exclusions, by
one Sponsor’s project entities and any additional assets contributed by such Sponsor to OpCo prior to the end of the most recent fiscal year, by (ii) the
cash generated and distributed, subject to certain exclusions, by both Sponsors’ project entities and any additional assets contributed by the Sponsors to
OpCo prior to the end of the most recent fiscal year. In addition, after November 30, 2019, payments on the economic interests are subject to an annual
reallocation among the Sponsors based on the relative performance of the assets contributed by each Sponsor compared to the projected performance of
such assets at the time of contribution.

The Sponsors agreed on a division of proceeds between them from the sale of the Partnership Entities or any of the Sponsors’ interests therein.
Such division of proceeds was the result of negotiation regarding the consideration required by SunPower for agreeing to enter into such transaction.
Such negotiations focused on the provisions of the limited liability company agreement of Holdings, and the General Partner related to the consent
rights of SunPower related to the proposed transactions. Pursuant to a separate agreement to effectuate the foregoing, First Solar has agreed to pay
SunPower additional consideration from the proceeds received at the Closing. As a result of such agreement, based on an unadjusted Unit Merger
Consideration, First Solar will receive an aggregate of approximately $242.8 million (or $10.98 per OpCo Unit) and SunPower will receive an aggregate
of approximately $387.1 million (or $13.40 per OpCo Unit).

Additionally, the Partnership entered into the Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2016, as amended, with First Solar,
SunPower, the General Partner, OpCo and Holdings (the “Omnibus Agreement”) and certain other agreements with the Sponsors, in which the Sponsors
agreed to provide a variety of operation, maintenance and asset management services, and certain performance warranties or availability guarantees (the
“O&M Agreements”). In addition, the Omnibus Agreement provided for certain indemnification obligations by the Sponsors relating to the ownership
and operation of each of First Solar’s and SunPower’s contributed projects. Simultaneous with the Closing, the parties will terminate the obligations,
including such indemnification obligations, under the Omnibus Agreement. The O&M Agreements will remain effective after the Closing under the
same terms and obligations.

On or prior to the Closing Date, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each of the Sponsors and their affiliates will be fully released
from providing certain credit support obligations, including but not limited to, performance bonds and surety bonds in connection with certain
contributed projects and guaranty agreements in favor of third parties. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon the
effectiveness of OpCo Merger 1, the Initial Surviving LLC will repay the loan incurred from First Solar in connection with the Partnership’s acquisition
of the Stateline Project.

Interests of Certain Directors and Officers of the General Partner

Certain directors of the General Partner Board are designees and employees of the Sponsors. Mr. Boynton, Chief Executive Officer of the General
Partner and director of the General Partner Board, is the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of SunPower; Ms. Jackson, Vice President
of Operations of the General Partner and director of the General Partner Board, is the Vice President for Project & Structured Finance at

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations

The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations with respect to the Transactions for U.S. holders (as
defined below) of the Class A shares. This summary is based on the provisions of the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder,
administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or varying
interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein. A ruling
from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary has not been sought, and there can be no
assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with such statements and conclusions.

This summary is limited to U.S. holders of Class A shares that hold their Class A shares as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of
the Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary is general in nature and does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation
that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their personal circumstances. In addition, this summary does not address the Medicare tax on certain
investment income, U.S. federal estate or gift tax laws, any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws, or any tax treaties. This summary also does not address tax
considerations that may be applicable to investors that may be subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as:
 

 •  banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions;

Table of Contents

 •  tax-exempt or governmental organizations;
 

 •  dealers in securities or foreign currencies;
 

 •  traders in securities that use the mark-to-market method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 •  persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
 

 •  partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or holders of interests therein;
 

 •  persons deemed to sell Class A shares under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;
 

 
•  persons that acquired Class A shares through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified

retirement plan;
 

 •  certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
 

 
•  persons that hold Class A shares as part of a straddle, appreciated financial position, synthetic security, hedge, conversion transaction or

other integrated investment or risk reduction transaction; and
 

 
•  persons that are part of a group that is in control of us (within the meaning of Section 304 of the Code) both immediately before and

immediately after the Partnership Merger.

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Class A shares, the tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner, upon the activities of the partnership and upon certain
determinations made at the partner level. A partner in a partnership (including entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) holding Class A shares should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Transactions.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Class A shares that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is:
 

 •  an individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;
 

 
•  a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that was created or organized in or under the

laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 •  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 

 
•  a trust (1) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and that has one or more United States persons

that have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) that has made a valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury
regulations to be treated as a United States person.

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF
ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH HOLDER OF CLASS A SHARES IS
STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT WITH AND RELY UPON ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE SPECIFIC FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL
AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF THE TRANSACTIONS.

Tax Characterization of the Partnership Merger

The receipt of the Share Merger Consideration in the Partnership Merger will be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In general, the Partnership Merger will be treated as a taxable sale of a U.S. holder’s Class A shares in exchange for the Share Merger
Consideration.

Table of Contents

Amount and Character of Gain or Loss Recognized

A U.S. holder who receives the Share Merger Consideration in the Partnership Merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Class A shares exchanged therefor.

Such gain or loss will generally be taxable as capital gain or loss. Capital gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder will generally be long-term
capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held its Class A shares for more than one year as of the closing of the Partnership Merger. Non-corporate U.S.
holders are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation on long-term capital gains. Capital losses recognized by a U.S. holder may offset capital gains
and, in the case of individuals, offset no more than $3,000 of ordinary income. Capital losses recognized by U.S. holders that are corporations may only
be used to offset capital gains.

Backup Withholding

Under the U.S. federal backup withholding tax rules, unless an exemption applies, the Paying Agent will be required to withhold, and will
withhold, 24% of the Share Merger Consideration to which a U.S. holder is entitled unless the holder provides a tax identification number, certifies that
such number is correct and that no backup withholding is otherwise required and otherwise complies with such backup withholding rules. The Paying
Agent will provide U.S. holders with instructions regarding the appropriate certification documentation.

The Transactions (Other Than the Partnership Merger) Are Not Taxable Events to U.S. Holders

The Transactions (other than the Partnership Merger) are not taxable events with respect to U.S. holders of Class A shares because the Public
Shareholders are not direct parties to such Transactions. Such Transactions will have no U.S. federal income tax consequences for such holders.

Financing of the Mergers

Parent estimates that the total amount of funds required to complete the Mergers, including to retire indebtedness, pay fees and expenses in
connection with the Mergers, is approximately $1.7 billion. Parent expects to fund this amount through a combination of:
 

 
•  committed equity financing available to Parent by CD CEI V, Co-Invest HoldCo 1 and Co-Invest HoldCo 2 (collectively, the “Equity

Investors”), which is described below under “—Equity Financing”; and
 

 
•  debt financing that has been committed to Parent by The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, UFJ, Ltd (“MUFG”), Massachusetts Mutual Life

Insurance Company (“Mass Mutual”), Key Bank National Association (“Key Bank”) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (“CBA” and
collectively with MUFG, Mass Mutual and Key Bank, the “Lenders”), which is described below under “—Debt Financing.”

The Merger Agreement does not contain a financing condition and if the debt financing or equity financing funds are not obtained, Parent shall
continue to be obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to consummate the
Transactions (provided that the Partnership may not seek specific performance in the event of Parent’s failure to consummate the Transactions due to the
failure to obtain the debt financing, in which case Parent would be obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee). The funding of the debt financing is
subject to the satisfaction of conditions set forth in the commitment letters pursuant to which the debt financing will be provided. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, Parent has agreed, among other things, to take all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
equity financing, and to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the debt financing.

Table of Contents

Equity Financing

The equity funds for the Mergers (which will be equal to all funds necessary to consummate the Transactions less any amounts received pursuant
to the debt financing (the “Equity Commitment Amount”)) will come from existing commitments from the Equity Investors, which are investment
vehicles managed by CDI.

The Equity Investors’ obligations to fund the Equity Commitment Amount are subject to the condition that the conditions to the Closing have
occurred and that the full amount of the Debt Financing (as defined below) has been funded concurrently with the Equity Commitment Amount.

The Equity Investors’ obligations to fund the Equity Financing will terminate upon the earliest to occur of:
 

 •  the Closing; and
 

 •  the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.

Debt Financing

In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, Parent has obtained a commitment letter from the Lenders (as amended from time to time
to the extent expressly permitted by, and in accordance with, the Merger Agreement, the “Debt Commitment Letter”) pursuant to which the Lenders
have committed to provide, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, debt financing consisting of (i) a term
loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion (the “Term Facility”), and (ii) an up to $60 million dollar letter of credit facility. The
financing described above in clauses (i) and (ii) collectively is referred to as the “Debt Financing.”

The Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter is conditioned on (i) the consummation of the Mergers in accordance with the
Merger Agreement (as amended from time to time to the extent expressly permitted by, and in accordance with, the Debt Commitment Letter) and
(ii) other customary conditions, including, but not limited to:
 

 
•  the execution and delivery by the borrowers and certain guarantors of definitive documentation consistent with the Debt Commitment

Letter;
 

 

•  the accuracy of representations and warranties made by or with respect to the General Partner, the Partnership, OpCo and all of their
respective direct and indirect subsidiaries in the Merger Agreement as are material to the interests of the Lenders under the Debt Financing,
but only to the extent Parent has the right not to consummate the Transactions, or to terminate its obligations (or otherwise does not have an
obligation to close), under the Merger Agreement as a result of a failure of such representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement to
be true and correct, and the accuracy of certain other specified representations and warranties in the loan documents;

 

 
•  there having not occurred, since November 30, 2016, any event that has resulted in a Partnership material adverse effect (as defined below

under “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation”);
 

 
•  the receipt by Parent of the Equity Commitment Amount (or such other funds necessary), which along with the proceeds of the Debt

Financing, are sufficient to consummate the Transactions;
 

 
•  the repayment of all existing indebtedness for borrowed money of the General Partner, the Partnership, OpCo and all of their respective

direct and indirect the subsidiaries shall have been repaid and any liens associated therewith have been released;
 

 •  payment of all applicable costs, fees and expenses;
 

 •  delivery of certain audited and unaudited financial statements and base case projections;

Table of Contents

 
•  receipt by the lead arrangers under the Debt Commitment Letter of documentation and other information about the borrowers and guarantors

required under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations (including the USA PATRIOT Act);
 

 
•  the execution and delivery of guarantees by the guarantors and the taking of certain actions necessary to establish and perfect a security

interest in specified items of collateral, subject to certain limitations specified in the Debt Commitment Letter;
 

 •  the receipt of consent from a third party under a certain power purchase agreement;
 

 
•  cancellation of all Class A interests and the transfer of all Class C interests, in each case, in the lower-tier Partnership Group entities that are

owned by SunPower;
 

 •  the delivery of certain environmental reports; and
 

 
•  the completion of a marketing period to syndicate the Term Facility prior to the Closing date, such marketing period to be at least thirty

(30) consecutive business days after the date Parent shall have delivered certain marketing material specified in the Debt Commitment
Letter.

If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the
related fee letter, Parent is required to use its reasonable best efforts to, among other things, arrange and obtain as promptly as practicable alternative
financing on terms and conditions that do not contain conditions to funding that are materially more adverse, in the aggregate, to Parent than the terms
and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter and the related fee letter in an amount at least equal to the amount of the Debt Financing or such
unavailable portion thereof.

The Lenders may invite other banks, financial institutions and institutional lenders to participate in the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter and to undertake a portion of the commitments to provide such Debt Financing, in each case as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter.

Escrow Agreement

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, 8point3 Solar, OpCo, the Partnership and the Bank of New York Mellon, a New York
banking corporation (the “Escrow Agent”), entered into an escrow agreement establishing an escrow account in support of the potential obligation of
Parent to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and 8point3 Solar deposited into the Escrow Account an
amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee. At the Closing, each of 8point3 Solar, the Partnership and OpCo shall deliver a notice to the Escrow Agent
directing the Escrow Agent to disburse all of the funds held in the escrow account on the Closing Date.

Accounting Treatment

The Mergers qualify as business combinations and the Transactions will be accounted for using the acquisition method.

No Dissenters’ or Appraisal Rights

Under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, as amended, and the Partnership Agreement, there are no dissenters’ or appraisal
rights for the Public Shareholders with respect to the Transactions.

Litigation

On March 31, 2018, John Taylor, a purported Shareholder, filed a putative class action complaint against the Partnership and the members of the
General Partner Board (collectively, the “Defendants”) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The case is captioned John
Taylor v. 8point3 Energy Partners LP, et al., Case No. 5:18-cv-01989 (N.D. Cal.). The complaint alleges that (1) the Defendants violated Section 14(a)

Table of Contents

of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, by allegedly misrepresenting or failing to disclose material information about the
Transactions in this proxy statement, and (2) the members of the General Partner Board, as alleged control persons of the Partnership, violated Section
20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the filing of an allegedly materially deficient proxy statement. Mr. Taylor has asked the court to, among
other things, (i) declare that his action is properly maintainable as a class action and certifying him as class representative, (ii) enjoin Defendants from
proceeding with or consummating the Transactions, unless and until the Partnership discloses additional material information which Mr. Taylor believes
was omitted from this proxy statement, (iii) direct the Defendants to account to Mr. Taylor and the class alleged damages sustained and (iv) award Mr.
Taylor attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses.

On April 3, 2018, Adam Franchi, a purported Shareholder, filed a putative class action complaint against the Defendants on behalf of a class of
Shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The case is captioned Adam Franchi v. 8point3 Energy Partners LP, et al., Case No.
1:18-cv-00493-UNA (D. Del.). The complaint alleges that (1) Defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder, by allegedly disseminating false and misleading material information or failing to disclose material information about the Transactions in
this proxy statement, and (2) the members of the General Partner Board, as alleged control persons of the Partnership, violated Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act in connection with the filing of an allegedly materially deficient proxy statement. Mr. Franchi has asked the court to, among other things,
(i) enjoin Defendants from proceeding with or consummating the Transactions; (ii) alternatively, if the Transactions are consummated, rescind the
Transactions or award rescissory damages, (iii) direct the members of the General Partner Board to disclose the material information allegedly misstated
or omitted from this proxy statement, (iv) declare that Defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder,
and/or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and (v) award Mr. Franchi attorneys’ and experts’ fees.

The Partnership believes that the complaints described above are without merit. The Partnership cannot predict the outcome of or estimate the
possible loss or range of loss from these matters. It is possible that additional, similar complaints may be filed or the complaints described above are
amended. If this occurs, the Partnership does not intend to announce the filing of each additional, similar complaint or any amended complaint unless it
contains materially new or different allegations.

Delisting and Deregistration of Class A Shares

If the Transactions are completed, the Class A shares will be delisted from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act (via
termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act). After the Closing, the Partnership will also file a Form 15 to suspend its
reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As a result, the Partnership will no longer be obligated to file any periodic reports or
other reports with the SEC on account of the Class A shares.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Mergers

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Holdings, the Partnership and Parent agreed to prepare, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement and, in no event later than ten (10) business days, file the notifications required under the
HSR Act. While a filing under the HSR Act is contemplated as a condition under the Merger Agreement, after further analysis, Holdings, the
Partnership and Parent concluded and agreed that filing under the HSR Act is not required.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Holdings, the Partnership and Parent agreed to, (i) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement, prepare and, in no event later than ten (10) business days after the date of this
Agreement, submit an application for approval from the FERC under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act (“FPA”), and (ii) use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the approval from
FERC so as to be able to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including

taking all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the FERC may assert under applicable law (including the FPA)
with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than August 6, 2018). The
Partnership submitted an application for approval to FERC on February 21, 2018.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, each party agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain CFIUS
Approval, including (i) exercising reasonable best efforts to promptly (and not later than fifteen (15) business days after the date of the Merger
Agreement, unless otherwise agreed by the parties) making the joint draft filing required in connection with obtaining CFIUS Approval in accordance
with Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the “DPA”), (ii) promptly making the joint final filing in connection with
obtaining CFIUS Approval and in accordance with the DPA after receipt of confirmation that CFIUS has no further comment to the draft filing, and
(iii) providing any information requested by any Governmental Authority (as defined below under “The Merger Agreement—Cooperation”) in
connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of the Transactions within the timeframes set forth in the DPA. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
Parent will not be in breach of its obligations under the Merger Agreement if any of its direct or indirect non-U.S. member or owner of Parent or
subsidiary of a non-U.S. Person (as defined below under “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation”) that is a direct
or indirect member or owner of Parent (each, a “Non-U.S. Member”) declines to provide information that it deems to be proprietary or otherwise not
advisable to make available, provided that Parent exercised reasonable best efforts in requesting such information of its Non-U.S. Members. A formal
filing was made with CFIUS on March 21, 2018 and accepted for review by CFIUS on March 28, 2018.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING AND VOTING

Date, Time and Place

The Partnership will hold a special meeting of Shareholders on May 23, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. (Pacific Time), at 77 Rio Robles, San Jose, California
95134.

Purpose

At the Shareholder Meeting, Shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the Merger Proposals.

Record Date and Quorum Requirement

The General Partner has fixed April 6, 2018 as the record date. Only holders of record of Class A shares as of the close of business on the record
date will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Shareholder Meeting. As of the record date, there were 28,093,305 Class A shares issued and
outstanding held by approximately four holders of record. Votes may be cast at the Shareholder Meeting in person or by proxy.

Each holder of record of Class A shares at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote for each Class A share then held on each
matter submitted to a vote of shareholders at the Shareholder Meeting. Pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, if any person or group (other
than the General Partner and its affiliates) owns, controls or holds 20% or more of the outstanding Class A shares, none of the Class A shares owned by
such person or group shall be entitled to vote on any matter. This loss of voting rights does not apply to any person or group that acquired the Class A
shares from the General Partner or its affiliates (other than the Partnership) and any transferees of that person or group approved by the General Partner
or to any person or group who acquired the shares with the prior approval of the General Partner Board. At the Shareholder Meeting, the presence, in
person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding Class A shares as of the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum for
the Shareholder Meeting and will permit the Partnership to conduct the proposed business at the Shareholder Meeting. Class A shares registered directly
in your name with the transfer agent will be counted as present at the Shareholder Meeting if you (1) are present in person at the Shareholder Meeting or
(2) have submitted and not revoked a properly executed proxy card or have submitted and not revoked your proxy via telephone or the Internet. Proxies
received but marked as abstentions will be counted as Class A shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a
quorum. If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your Class A shares will not be voted on any proposal on which your broker does not
have discretionary authority to vote. This is referred to in this proxy statement and in general as a broker non-vote. In these cases, the broker can register
your Class A shares as being present at the Shareholder Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be able to vote on those matters for
which specific authorization is required. Brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on the Merger Proposals and a broker non-vote will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposals. If you fail to submit a proxy or do not vote in person at the Shareholder Meeting, your
Class A shares will not count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. Assuming there is a quorum, failures to vote, broker
non-votes (if any) and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the Merger Proposals.

Submitting a Proxy Card

Holders of record can ensure that their shares are voted at the Shareholder Meeting by completing, signing, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy
card in the enclosed postage-prepaid envelope. Submitting instructions by this method will not affect your right to attend the Shareholder Meeting.

If you hold your Class A shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the separate voting instructions, if any, provided by
the bank, broker or other nominee with this proxy statement.

Table of Contents

Submitting a Proxy via Telephone or Internet

Submitting a proxy via telephone or the Internet is fast and convenient. If you are a holder of record and choose to submit your proxy via
telephone or the Internet, instructions to do so are set forth on the enclosed proxy card. The telephone and Internet proxy procedures are designed to
authenticate proxies by use of a personal control number, which appears on the proxy card. These procedures, which comply with Delaware law, allow
you to appoint a proxy to vote your Class A shares and to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you submit your proxy via
telephone or the Internet, you do not have to mail in your proxy card.

If your Class A shares are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, please follow the instructions provided with your proxy materials to determine
if Internet or telephone proxy submission is available. If your bank, broker or other nominee does make Internet or telephone proxy submission
available, please follow the instructions provided on the voting form supplied by your bank, broker or other nominee.

Revoking Your Proxy

If your Class A shares are registered directly in your name with the transfer agent, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
Shareholder Meeting by:
 

 •  submitting another proxy prior to the Shareholder Meeting through any of the methods available to you;
 

 
•  giving written notice of your revocation to the General Partner’s General Counsel, which must be received by the General Counsel by the

time the Shareholder Meeting begins; or
 

 •  attending the Shareholder Meeting and voting your Class A shares in person.

If your Class A shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions of your bank, broker or other nominee

If you have more questions about the Mergers or how to submit your proxy, or if you need additional copies of this proxy statement or the
enclosed proxy card or voting instructions, please contact Innisfree, the Partnership’s proxy solicitor, by calling toll-free at (877) 750-8338.

Voting at the Shareholder Meeting

Shareholder Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the Shareholder Meeting. Please note, however, that if your Class A shares
are held in “street name,” which means your Class A shares are held of record by a bank, broker or other nominee, and you wish to vote at the
Shareholder Meeting, you must bring to the Shareholder Meeting a proxy from the record holder of the Class A shares authorizing you to vote at the
Shareholder Meeting. Please contact your bank, broker or other nominee for specific instructions.

approval of the Partnership Merger requires the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the outstanding Class A shares (excluding Class A shares owned by
the General Partner or its affiliates), voting as a class, and (ii) a majority of the outstanding Class B shares, voting as a class. Simultaneously with the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding Class A shares (excluding the Class A shares owned by the General Partner or its affiliates), the
Partnership will solicit a written consent from the Sponsors voting their Class B shares in favor of the Merger Agreement and the Partnership Merger.
The Sponsors, who indirectly own 100.0% of the outstanding Class B shares, have entered in to the Support Agreement (as defined below), pursuant to
which the Sponsors have agreed to vote their Class B shares for the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Partnership
Merger.

OpCo Merger Proposal

The approval of the OpCo Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding Class A shares to direct the Partnership
to vote its corresponding number of OpCo Common Units in favor of the OpCo Mergers. The approval of the OpCo Mergers requires the affirmative
vote of (i) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Common Units (excluding OpCo Common Units whose voting power is, with respect to the subject vote,
controlled by the General Partner or its affiliates, other than the Partnership, through ownership or otherwise), voting as a class, (ii) a majority of the
outstanding OpCo Subordinated Units, voting as a class and (iii) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Common Units, voting as a class. Immediately
following the approval of the OpCo Merger Proposal, a written consent in favor of the OpCo Merger 1 Proposal will be solicited from the Partnership,
the Sponsors and their affiliates.

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership, as a member of OpCo, shall vote (or refrain from voting) the OpCo Common Units it
holds in the same manner as the holders of Class A shares have voted (or refrained from voting) their Class A shares on the matter. The Sponsors, who
indirectly own 35.6% of the outstanding OpCo Common Units and 100.0% of the outstanding OpCo Subordinated Units, have entered in to the Support
Agreement, pursuant to which the Sponsors have agreed to vote their OpCo Units for the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions,
including the OpCo Mergers.

Subject to revocation, all shares represented by each properly submitted proxy will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated. If you
return a signed proxy card or submit your proxy via the Internet or by telephone but do not provide voting instructions (other than in the case of any
broker non-votes), the shares represented by your properly submitted proxy will be voted (1) “FOR” the Partnership Merger Proposal and (2) “FOR”
the OpCo Merger Proposal, and in such manner as the persons named on the proxy card in their discretion determine with respect to such other business
as may properly come before the Shareholder Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

Failures to vote, broker non-votes (if any) and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote (1) “AGAINST” the Partnership Merger Proposal
and (2) “AGAINST” the OpCo Merger Proposal.

Submitting a proxy confers discretionary authority on the persons named on the proxy card to vote the shares represented by the proxy on any
other matter that is properly presented for action at the Shareholder Meeting or any reconvened meeting following an adjournment of the Shareholder
Meeting, so long as the General Partner Board is not aware of any such other matter a reasonable time before the Shareholder Meeting. As of the date of
this proxy statement, the Partnership does not know of any other matter to be raised at the Shareholder Meeting.

As of April 6, 2018, the record date for the Shareholder Meeting, the directors and executive officers of the General Partner held and were entitled
to vote, in the aggregate, Class A shares representing less than 1% of the outstanding Class A shares. The Partnership believes that the directors and
executive officers of the General Partner intend to vote all of their Class A shares “FOR” the Merger Proposals.

outstanding Class A shares (excluding Class A shares owned by the General Partner or its affiliates), voting as a class, and (ii) a majority of the

OpCo Mergers. The approval of the OpCo Mergers requires the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Common Units (excluding
OpCo Common Units whose voting power is, with respect to the subject vote, controlled by the General Partner or its affiliates, other than the
Partnership, through ownership or otherwise), voting as a class, (ii) a majority of the outstanding OpCo Subordinated Units, voting as a class and (iii) a
majority of the outstanding OpCo Common Units, voting as a class. Immediately following the approval of the OpCo Merger Proposal, a written

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership, as a member of OpCo, shall vote (or refrain from voting) the OpCo Common Units it
holds in the same manner as the holders of Class A shares have voted (or refrained from voting) their Class A shares on the matter. The Sponsors, who
indirectly own 35.6% of the outstanding OpCo Common Units and 100.0% of the outstanding OpCo Subordinated Units, have entered in to the Support
Agreement, pursuant to which the Sponsors have agreed to vote their OpCo Units for the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions,
including the OpCo Mergers.

Accordingly, each of the GP Conflicts Committee and the General Partner Board recommends that the Shareholders vote “FOR” the OpCo
Merger Proposal.

POSTPONEMENT OR ADJOURNMENT

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, prior to the date of the Shareholder Meeting, the General Partner, as the general partner of the Partnership,
may postpone the Shareholder Meeting one or more times for any reason by giving no fewer than two days’ notice to each Shareholder entitled to vote
at the meeting and a new record date does not need to be fixed if the postponement is not for more than 45 days. In addition, pursuant to the Partnership
Agreement, the General Partner may adjourn the Shareholder Meeting one or more times for any reason. No vote of the Shareholders is required for any
adjournment. The Shareholder Meeting may be adjourned to a date within 45 days of the Shareholder Meeting without further notice other than by an
announcement made at the Shareholder Meeting (or such adjourned meeting) and without setting a new record date. If the requisite shareholder votes to
approve the Merger Proposals have not been received at the time of the Shareholder Meeting (or such adjourned meeting), the Partnership may choose
to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Merger Proposals.

OTHER MATTERS

Other Matters for Action at the Special Meeting

As of the date of this proxy statement, the General Partner Board knows of no matters that will be presented for consideration at the Shareholder
Meeting other than as described in this proxy statement.

Householding of Special Meeting Materials

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as brokers or banks) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy
statements with respect to two or more security holders sharing the same address by delivering a single notice or proxy statement addressed to those
security holders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially provides extra convenience for security holders and cost
savings for companies. Some banks, brokers and other nominees may be participating in the practice of “householding” proxy statements and annual
reports. As indicated in the notice provided by these banks, brokers and other nominees to Shareholders, a single proxy statement will be delivered to
multiple Shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected Shareholder. Once you have received notice
from your bank, broker or other nominee that it will be “householding” communications to your address, “householding” will continue until you are
notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you would prefer to receive separate copies of the proxy statement either now or in
the future, please contact your bank, broker or other nominee or contact Innisfree, the Partnership’s proxy solicitor, by written or oral request to the
Partnership at the address and telephone number stated above.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex A and incorporated by reference herein.
The description of the Merger Agreement in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger
Agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to
you. The Partnership encourages you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety before making any decisions regarding the Mergers, as it
is the legal document governing the Mergers. The Merger Agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information
regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement.

Factual disclosures about the Partnership contained in this proxy statement or its respective reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or
modify the factual disclosures about the Partnership contained in the Merger Agreement and described in these summaries. The representations,
warranties and covenants made in the Merger Agreement by the Partnership Entities, Holdings or the Parent Entities, as applicable, were qualified and
subject to important limitations agreed to by the Partnership Entities, Holdings or the Parent Entities, respectively, in connection with negotiating the
terms of the Merger Agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and described in
this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk
between the parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a
contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to shareholders or unitholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC
and in some cases, were qualified by confidential disclosures that were made by each party to the other, which disclosures are not reflected in the
Merger Agreement or otherwise publicly disclosed.

The Mergers and the Equity Transfers

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) OpCo Merger Sub 1 will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, merge with and into OpCo
and the separate existence of OpCo Merger Sub 1 will cease and OpCo will continue as the surviving limited liability company of OpCo Merger 1, (ii)
OpCo Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into the Initial Surviving LLC and the separate existence of OpCo Merger Sub 2 will cease and the Initial
Surviving LLC will continue as the surviving limited liability company of OpCo Merger 2, and (iii) Partnership Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Partnership and the separate existence of Partnership Merger Sub will cease and the Partnership shall continue as the Surviving Partnership. Holdings
will transfer to 8point3 Solar or an affiliate of 8point3 Solar designated by 8point3 Solar, and 8point3 Solar (or its designated affiliate) will accept, for
no consideration, the transfer and delivery of the Equity Transfers. The Mergers will be effective at the time the respective certificates of merger are
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time, if agreed upon by the parties and specified in the certificates of merger
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware).

Units canceled pursuant to (i) above. In addition, and notwithstanding the cancellation of the OpCo Common Units and the OpCo Subordinated Units
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following the OpCo Merger 2 Effective Time, holders as of the relevant record date of the OpCo Common Units and
the OpCo Subordinated Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the OpCo Merger 2 Effective Time will have continued rights to any Unpaid
OpCo Distribution.

Pursuant to the Partnership Merger, upon the Partnership Merger Effective Time, (i) each issued and outstanding Class A share will (a) be

Unit or OpCo Subordinated Unit, or (B) if the Closing occurs after May 31, 2018: (1) $0.3282 per Class A share, OpCo Common Unit or OpCo
Subordinated Unit, plus (2) the product of the number of days from June 1, 2018 through and including the Closing Date multiplied by $0.0045 per
Class A share, OpCo Common Unit or OpCo Subordinated Unit, minus (ii) any distributions paid after January 12, 2018 and prior to the Closing (the
“Consideration Adjustment”). Assuming a Closing Date of May 24, 2018, each Public Shareholder and each Unitholder will receive $12.3833 per Class
A share, OpCo Common Unit or OpCo Subordinated Unit.

The General Partner Interest will be unaffected by the Mergers and will remain outstanding, such that, upon the Equity Transfers, the General
Partner Interest will be owned, directly or indirectly, by 8point3 Solar or an affiliate of 8point3 Solar designated by 8point3 Solar.

Payment for the Class A Shares

The conversion of Class A shares into the right to receive the Share Merger Consideration will occur automatically upon the Partnership Merger

entry form (“Book-Entry Shares”) for the applicable Share Merger Consideration and any Unpaid Partnership Distribution.

At or prior to the Closing Date, Parent will deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of cash equal to the sum of the aggregate Share Merger
Consideration as adjusted for the Consideration Adjustment and any Unpaid Partnership Distribution (which shall include the amount of cash received
by the Partnership in the Special Distribution) (the “Exchange Fund”). The Paying Agent will deliver the Share Merger Consideration and any Unpaid
Partnership Distribution contemplated to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose.

As soon as reasonably practicable after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Paying Agent to send, to each
holder of Book-Entry Shares (other than The Depository Trust Company

(“DTC”)) as of the Partnership Merger Effective Time (and, to the extent commercially practicable, Parent will, or will cause the Paying Agent to, make
available for collection by hand, during customary business hours commencing immediately after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, if so elected
by a holder of Book-Entry Shares) a letter of transmittal (each such letter, a “Letter of Transmittal”) to be used for surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Each
holder of Book-Entry Shares (other than DTC), upon surrender thereof by delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the terms of such Letter of Transmittal, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, will be entitled
to receive in exchange for each surrendered Book-Entry Share a cash amount equal to the Share Merger Consideration to which such Shareholder is
entitled, after giving effect to any required tax withholdings, plus any Unpaid Partnership Distribution. DTC, upon surrender of its Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the customary surrender procedures of DTC and the Paying Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange for each surrendered Book-
Entry Share a cash amount equal to the Share Merger Consideration, plus any Unpaid Partnership Distribution. Each Book-Entry Share so surrendered
will be canceled.

The Share Merger Consideration and Unpaid Partnership Distribution will be paid to (i) the holders of Book-Entry Shares (other than DTC), as
promptly as practicable after receipt by the Paying Agent of the Letter of Transmittal in respect thereof, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
and (ii) DTC, as promptly as practicable after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Generally,
payment of the Share Merger Consideration and Unpaid Partnership Distribution with respect to Book-Entry Shares will only be made to the person in
whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry
Shares. Until surrendered and paid as contemplated in the Merger Agreement, each Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Partnership
Merger Effective Time, as applicable, to represent only the right to receive the Share Merger Consideration and any Unpaid Partnership Distribution in
cash as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Share Merger Consideration and any Unpaid Partnership Distribution paid upon surrender of such
Book-Entry Shares will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Book-Entry Shares.

No person beneficially owning Class A shares through DTC will be required to deliver a Letter of Transmittal to receive the Share Merger
Consideration or any Unpaid Partnership Distribution that such holder is entitled to receive through DTC. Any such Person will receive its Share Merger
Consideration and any Unpaid Partnership Distribution in accordance with the customary payment procedures of DTC following the Partnership Merger
Effective Time.

Approval. See “Information about the Shareholder Meeting and Voting.”

Shareholders that they approve the Merger Agreement and the Mergers and use reasonable best efforts to obtain Shareholder Approval. The

any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made by such party with any governmental or regulatory (including stock exchange) authority, agency,
court commission, or other governmental body (each, a “Governmental Authority”) in connection with the Transactions, and shall submit as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information requested in connection with such filings and notices, (ii) obtain each consent (if any) required to be
obtained (pursuant to any applicable law or contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the Transactions, and (iii) oppose or to lift, as the
case may be, any restraint, injunction, or other legal bar to the Transactions. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to obtaining CFIUS Approval,
which shall be governed by the obligations set forth below.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Holdings, the Partnership and Parent agreed to prepare, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement and, in no event later than ten (10) business days, file the notifications required under the
HSR Act. Without limiting the foregoing, Holdings, the Partnership and Parent shall take all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust
enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction, or any other person, may assert under any applicable law
with respect to the Transactions, and to avoid or eliminate, and minimize the impact of, each and every impediment under any applicable law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, in each case so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date (as defined below)). While a filing under the HSR Act is contemplated as a condition under
the Merger Agreement, after further analysis, Holdings, the Partnership and Parent concluded and agreed that filing under the HSR Act is not required.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Holdings, the Partnership and Parent agreed to, (i) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement, prepare and, in no event later than ten (10) business days after the date of this
Agreement, submit an application for approval from the FERC under Section 203 of the FPA, and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the approval from FERC so as to be able to
consummate and make effective the Transactions, including taking all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the
FERC may assert under applicable law (including the FPA) with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date). The Partnership submitted an application for approval to FERC on February 21, 2018.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, each party agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain CFIUS
Approval, including (i) exercising reasonable best efforts to promptly (and not later than fifteen (15) business days after the date of the Merger
Agreement, unless otherwise agreed by the parties) making the joint draft filing required in connection with obtaining CFIUS Approval in accordance
with Section 721 of the DPA, (ii) promptly making the joint final filing in connection with obtaining CFIUS Approval and in accordance with the DPA
after receipt of confirmation that CFIUS has no further comment to the draft filing, and (iii) providing any information requested by any Governmental
Authority in connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of the Transactions within the timeframes set forth in the DPA. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, Parent will not be in breach of its obligations under the Merger Agreement if any Non-U.S. Member declines to provide information that it
deems to be proprietary or otherwise not advisable to make available, provided that Parent exercised reasonable best efforts in requesting such
information of its Non-U.S. Members. A formal filing was made with CFIUS on March 21, 2018 and accepted for review by CFIUS on March 28, 2018.

No Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation

No Solicitation

The Merger Agreement provides that the Partnership Entities and Holdings have agreed for themselves that they shall not, and that they shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their subsidiaries and respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by the Partnership Entities (collectively, the “Representatives”) not to: (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage (including by providing information; provided that any communication undertaken by the Partnership Entities or Holdings in the
ordinary course of business and not related, directly or indirectly, to an Alternative Proposal (as defined below) or the Mergers or any other similar
transaction shall not, in and of itself be deemed an action by the Partnership Entities or Holdings to encourage) any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to, or the making or completion of, an Alternative Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations or discussions (other than to (x) state
that they are not permitted to have discussions or (y) seek clarification regarding the terms of an Alternative Proposal), approve or provide or cause to be
provided any non-public information or data relating to any of the Partnership Group Entities in connection with, an Alternative Proposal, (iii) take any

publicly propose or announce to do any of the foregoing (subject to the exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement).

The Merger Agreement provides that the Partnership Entities and Holdings will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) the Partnership may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality agreement, standstill agreement or similar agreement to the
extent necessary to allow an Alternative Proposal to be made to the Partnership or the General Partner Board or any committee thereof (including the GP
Conflicts Committee), and (ii) the Partnership shall be deemed to have waived, as of immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, any
provision in any such agreement to the extent necessary to allow the applicable counterparty to convey an Alternative Proposal to the Partnership or the
General Partner Board or any committee thereof (including the GP Conflicts Committee).

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, the Partnership and Holdings may,

received after the date of the Merger Agreement and (ii) which the General Partner Board (after due consideration of the recommendation of the GP
Conflicts Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with outside financial and legal advisors) constitutes or may reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, (as defined below) (A) furnish information with respect to the General Partner and the Partnership Group Entities and the
Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities to the Person (as defined below) making such Alternative Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2017 by and among First
Solar, SunPower, the Partnership and Capital Dynamics Limited, a Delaware corporation (except for such changes specifically necessary in order for the
Partnership Entities and Holdings to be able to comply with their obligations under the Merger Agreement and it being understood that the Partnership
Entities and Holdings may enter into a confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision) and (B) engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with such Person and its Representatives regarding such Alternative Proposal; provided, however, that the Partnership and Holdings shall
provide or make available to Parent any material non-public information concerning the General Partner and the Partnership Group Entities and the
Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities that is provided to the Person making such Alternative Proposal or its Representatives which was not
previously provided or made available to Parent.

No Withdrawal of Recommendation

The Merger Agreement provides that neither the General Partner Board nor the GP Conflicts Committee may (i) withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to the Parent Entities the Board Recommendation (as defined below), (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend,
any Alternative Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Board Recommendation in this proxy statement distributed to the Shareholders in connection with the
Transactions, or (iv) resolve or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any of such actions, an “Adverse Recommendation Change”).

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above and subject to compliance with the procedures described below, at any time prior to obtaining
Shareholder Approval,
 

 

(i) an Intervening Event (as defined below) has occurred and is continuing and the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, that the consummation of the Mergers would not be in,
or would be adverse to, the best interests of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders or would otherwise be inconsistent with its
duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable Law, then the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee may effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change; and/or

 

 

(ii) the Partnership receives a Bona Fide Alternative Proposal and the General Partner Board after due consideration of the recommendation of
the GP Conflicts Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, that (A) such Alternative
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) the consummation of the Mergers would not be in, or would be adverse to, the best
interests of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders or would otherwise be inconsistent with its duties under the Partnership
Agreement or applicable law, then the General Partner Board may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the Partnership, upon
receiving such authorization from the General Partner Board, may enter into a definitive alternative acquisition agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal if, with respect to this clause (B), the Partnership concurrently terminates the Merger Agreement pursuant to the
terms therein. If the GP Conflicts Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, that
(A) such Alternative Proposal constitutes (or could reasonably be expected to constitute) a Superior Proposal and (B) the consummation of
the Mergers would not be in, or would be adverse to the best interests of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders or would
otherwise be inconsistent with its duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable law and the General Partner Board does not act
consistently with the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee, the GP Conflicts Committee may effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change.

Table of Contents

The General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee, as applicable, will be entitled to effect, or cause the Partnership Entities to effect, an
Adverse Recommendation Change or authorize the termination of the Merger Agreement in connection with a Superior Proposal only if: (i) the
Partnership notifies Parent in writing at least three (3) business days before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons therefor,
including, if applicable, the identity of the person making the Alternative Proposal; (ii) to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, the Partnership has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent and its Representatives during such three (3) business day period,
to enable Parent to effect revisions to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement that would, if a Superior Proposal has been made, cause such
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or, in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change, it would cause the General
Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee to no longer believe that making an Adverse Recommendation Change would be in, or not adverse to, the
best interests of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders or would otherwise be consistent with their duties under the Partnership Agreement or
applicable law; and (iii) if Parent makes a proposal during such three (3) business day period to adjust the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement, the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee, as applicable, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement as proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that
such Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal, if applicable, and that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
the Merger Agreement, as applicable, could be adverse to the interests of the Partnership Group or Public Shareholders or would otherwise be
inconsistent with their duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable law.

The Partnership promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) must disclosure to Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any written
Alternative Proposal and any written request for non-public information relating to the General Partner and the Partnership Group Entities and the
Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities (other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related to an Alternative Proposal), and, in
each case, shall disclose to Parent the identity of the Person making the written Alternative Proposal or request, and in the case of an Alternative
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal. The Partnership shall, upon the request of Parent, keep Parent reasonably
informed of any material developments with respect to any Alternative Proposal.

Certain Defined Terms

The term “Alternative Proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or “group” (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act), other than Parent and its subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, and whether through a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, unit exchange, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction), outside of the ordinary course of business, of assets of the Partnership Group Entities equal
to 20% or more of the consolidated assets, cash available for distribution (as defined in the documents filed by the Partnership with the SEC) or
Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the documents filed by the Partnership with the SEC) of the Partnership Group Entities or to which 20% or more of the
consolidated revenues or earnings of the Partnership Group Entities are attributable, or (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction

Amendment, Extension and Waiver

The parties may amend provisions of the Merger Agreement at any time, whether before or after receipt of the Shareholder Approval. None of the
General Partner, the Partnership or OpCo may take or authorize any such amendment or modification unless the General Partner Board has first referred
such action to the GP Conflicts Committee for its consideration and the GP Conflicts Committee has approved such amendment or modification. No
amendment that requires approval by Shareholders following the Shareholder Approval will be permitted without the further approval of such
Shareholders. In addition, no amendments or modifications that affect MUFG and any permitted assignees shall be effective without the prior written
consent of MUFG and any permitted assignees. All such amendments must be in writing and signed by each of the parties.

At any time prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the parties may (i) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in the Merger Agreement, (ii) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties or (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the Merger Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to the Merger Agreement to
assert any of its rights under the Merger Agreement or otherwise does not constitute a waiver of such rights.

In addition to any approvals required by the Partnership or the General Partner’s governing documents or under the Transaction Documents, any
determination, discussion, approval, consent or agreement of any Partnership Entity or the General Partner Board required to be made pursuant to the
Merger Agreement or any Transaction Document, and any decision or determination by any Partner Entity or the General Partner Board to (x) terminate
the Merger Agreement or (y) enforce the Merger Agreement, must be made or approved, as applicable, by both the GP Conflicts Committee and the
General Partner Board, and such action shall not require approval of the Public Shareholders.

Specific Enforcement

The Merger Agreement provides that, except as set forth below, each party to the Merger Agreement will be entitled to seek against the other
parties (i) injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement, (ii) specific enforcement of its terms and provisions and (iii) any other remedies to
which they are entitled at law or in equity in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Parent Entities are not permitted or entitled to receive more than one of a grant of specific performance,
the Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, in respect of the same underlying claim. Similarly, pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, the Partnership Entities are not permitted or entitled to receive more than one of a grant of specific performance, the Parent Termination Fee
or the Partnership Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, in respect of the same underlying claim.

The Merger Agreement provides that if, despite the parties’ satisfaction of all closing conditions, Parent fails or is unable to consummate the
Closing due to the failure to obtain the debt financing, the General Partner and the Partnership Entities will not be entitled to pursue (or continue
pursuing) specific performance, in which case Parent would be obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee.

Completion of the Transactions is expected to occur, subject to satisfaction of certain customary conditions, government approvals and vote by the
Shareholders, in the second quarter of 2018. Upon completion of the Transactions, the Partnership will no longer have publicly listed or traded shares,
nor will it be a reporting company under the SEC’s rules and regulations.

On January 12, 2018, OpCo distributed an aggregate of $22.2 million to the holders of the OpCo Common Units and OpCo Subordinated Units,
and the Partnership, in turn, distributed an aggregate of $7.9 million that it received from OpCo’s distribution to the holders of its Class A shares, or, in
each case, $0.2802 per share or unit for the period from September 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017. Although the Partnership Agreement requires that the
Partnership distribute its available cash each quarter, and the OpCo LLC Agreement requires OpCo to distribute its available cash each quarter, neither
the Partnership nor OpCo has a legal obligation to distribute any particular amount per Class A Share or per OpCo Unit. During the pendency of the
Transactions, the Partnership and OpCo intend to make quarterly distributions of $0.2802 per share, which maintains the distribution level at the end of
fiscal year 2017. On March 22, 2018, the General Partner Board declared a cash distribution for the Class A shares of $0.2802 per share for the first
quarter of 2018, which will be paid April 13, 2018 to Shareholders of record as of April 3, 2018.

Table of Contents

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of the Class A shares as of April 6, 2018, held by:
 

 •  each person known by the Partnership to be a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Class A shares;
 

 •  each of the directors of the General Partner;
 

 •  each of the General Partner’s named executive officers; and
 

 •  all of the General Partner’s directors and executive officers as a group.

The amounts and percentage of Class A shares beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of the SEC governing the determination
of beneficial ownership of securities. Under the rules of the SEC, a person is deemed to be a “beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares
“voting power,” which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or “investment power,” which includes the power to dispose of
or to direct the disposition of such security. Except as indicated by footnote, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment
power with respect to all of the Class A and Class B shares shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws where applicable.

Percentage of total Class A shares beneficially owned is based on 28,093,305 Class A shares outstanding as of April 6, 2018. Percentage of total
Class B shares beneficially owned is based on 51,000,000 Class B shares outstanding as of April 6, 2018.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

Under applicable Delaware law and the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership is not required to hold an annual meeting of its Shareholders.
Under the Partnership Agreement, a special meeting of the Shareholders may be called by the General Partner or by Shareholders owning 20% or more
of the outstanding shares of the class or classes for which a meeting is proposed. Such Shareholders may call a special meeting by delivering to the
General Partner one or more requests in writing stating that the signing Shareholders wish to call a special meeting and indicating the specific purposes
for which the special meeting is to be called and the class or classes of shares for which the meeting is proposed. No business may be brought by any
Shareholder before such special meeting except the business listed in the related request. However, Shareholders are not allowed to vote on matters that
would cause the Shareholders to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to
jeopardize the Shareholders’ limited liability under Delaware law or the law of any other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do business.

This proxy statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities, or the solicitation of a proxy, in any
jurisdiction to or from any person to whom it is not lawful to make any offer or solicitation in that jurisdiction. The delivery of this proxy statement
should not create an implication that there has been no change in the affairs of the Partnership since the date of this proxy statement or that the
information herein is correct as of any later date regardless of the time of delivery of this proxy statement.

The provisions of the Merger Agreement are extensive and not easily summarized. You should carefully read the Merger Agreement in its entirety
because it, and not this proxy statement, is the legal document that governs the Mergers, including the Partnership Merger, of the Partnership in which
you own Class A shares.

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by each of the parties to the Merger Agreement. These representations and
warranties have been made solely for the benefit of the other parties to such Merger Agreement and:
 

 
•  may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be

inaccurate;
 

 
•  have been qualified by disclosures that were made to the other parties in connection with the negotiation of the Mergers, which disclosures

are not reflected in the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material to you or other investors; and
 

 
•  were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date or dates as may be specified in the Merger Agreement and are

subject to more recent developments.

Accordingly, these representations and warranties may not describe the actual state of affairs as of the date they were made or at any other time.

The Partnership has not authorized anyone to provide you with information that is different from what is contained in this proxy
statement. This proxy statement is dated April 6, 2018. You should not assume that the information contained in this proxy statement is
accurate as of any date other than that date, or that the information contained in the Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-Ks incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement is accurate as of the date that such form was filed. Neither the mailing of the proxy statement to
shareholders nor the issuance of the Share Merger Consideration pursuant to the Partnership Merger will create any implication to the
contrary.

Partnership Distribution in accordance with this Section 2.5 and any Unpaid Partnership Distribution prior to that time will thereafter look only to
8point3 Solar for delivery of the Share Merger Consideration and any Unpaid Partnership Distribution in respect of such holder’s Book-Entry

previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Partnership Merger Sub, OpCo Merger Subs, the Partnership, OpCo,

cooperate with Parent in coordinating the deduction and withholding of any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Tax Law. To
the extent amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts (i) will promptly be paid over to the appropriate Tax authority and (ii) will be treated for the
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made.

Section 5.8 Solvency. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions to Parent’s obligation to consummate the Mergers, or waiver of such conditions,
and after giving effect to the Transactions, including the payment of the aggregate Share Merger Consideration and OpCo Merger Consideration,
payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, and payment of all related fees and expenses, and
assuming that the Partnership, OpCo and the Partnership Entities are Solvent immediately before the Closing and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of the entities comprising Parent, the Surviving Partnership and the Surviving LLC will be Solvent as of the Closing and
immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Solvent” when used with
respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination (a) the amount of the “fair saleable value” of the assets of such Person will, as of such
date, exceed (i) the value of all “liabilities” of such Person, including “contingent and other liabilities”, as of such date, as such quoted terms are

or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature. For purposes of this definition, “not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged” and “able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature” means that such Person will be able to
generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

Financing Sources have committed to provide, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the Bridge Facility (as defined therein) debt
financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the “Debt Financing”). The term “Debt Commitment Letter” as used
herein shall mean (i) the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and (ii) a New
Debt Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect. Parent also has delivered to the Partnership a true, complete and correct copy of the executed fee
letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from the Debt Financing Sources (the “Debt Fee Letter”), in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter
(it being understood that any such Fee Letter provided to the Partnership is redacted to omit the numerical fee amounts and certain other commercially
sensitive numbers and provisions set forth therein that would not adversely affect the aggregate amount, availability or conditionality of the Debt
Financing).

(b) The amount of funds contemplated to be provided pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, together with the equity funds available to
the Parent at the Closing (the “Equity Funds”), are sufficient to satisfy all of Parent’s payment obligations under this Agreement, including under Article
II, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to pay all other amounts payable by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing.

(c) Neither the Debt Commitment Letter nor the Debt Fee Letter has been amended, restated or otherwise modified as of the date of this
Agreement and, except as permitted by Section 6.16 or as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Partnership, as of the Closing Date, and no such
amendment, restatement or modification is presently contemplated, and the commitments set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been
withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect. The Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered to the Partnership on the date of this
Agreement, is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, in each case except as that

enforceability may be (i) limited by any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and (ii) subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether that enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

(d) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, or the Equity Funds, other than as expressly set forth in Article VII. Assuming the accuracy of the
Partnership’s representations and warranties contained herein, as of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or the Debt Financing Sources, as
applicable, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter, except that no
representation or warranty is made to the extent that any term or condition requires any action by, or otherwise relates to, the Partnership, OpCo or their
respective Subsidiaries. Assuming the accuracy of the Partnership’s representations and warranties contained herein, as of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Debt Financing and
Equity Funds will not be available to Parent for purposes of satisfying its payment obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on the Closing Date.

(e) Except for the Debt Fee Letter referred to in Section 5.9(a) (which does not relate to the amounts or conditionality of, or contain any
conditions precedent to, the funding of the Debt Financing), there are no side letters or other written or oral agreements, contracts or arrangements
related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter and delivered to the Partnership on or prior to the date of this Agreement. Parent has fully paid or caused to be paid any and all commitment and
other fees, costs and expenses that have been incurred and are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letter.

Section 5.10 Financial Statements.

(a) The unaudited balance sheet of CD CEI V JV Holdco as of December 31, 2017, attached hereto as Schedule 5.10 (the “Parent Balance
Sheet”), (i) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the period involved (subject to (1) the lack of footnotes
and normal year-end adjustments which are not, individually or in the aggregate, material and (2) first year audit procedures of FASB ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurements, related to Level III fair market value investments that are in operation), and (ii) fairly presents in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of CD CEI V JV Holdco as of the date thereof (subject to (1) normal year-end adjustments which are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material and (2) first year audit procedures of FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, related to Level III fair
market value investments that are in operation).

(b) Since December 31, 2017, through the date of this Agreement, except as otherwise contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, there
has not been any event, development or state of circumstances that would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2017, neither CD CEI V JV Holdco nor any of its Affiliates has incurred, any liabilities that would
be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of CD CEI V JV Holdco, except liabilities (i) that are accrued or reserved
against in the Parent Balance Sheet or reflected in the notes thereto, (ii) incurred in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
Transactions contemplated herein, (iii) that would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or (iv) that have been discharged or paid in full.

(c) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or any “off-balance sheet arrangements” (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the
purpose of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent in Parent’s financial
statements.

Section 5.11 Brokers. Neither Holdings nor any Parent Entity or Partnership Group Entity will have any liability for, and no broker, investment
banker or financial advisor is entitled to, any broker’s, finders’ or financial advisor’s fee or commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, in

of Transmittal or (B) in connection with any payment of Share Merger Consideration through DTC and (iii) the representations and warranties
made in any certificate required to be delivered under Section 7.2(d), none of the Partnership Entities, Holdings or any other Person is making or
has made, and none of the Parent Entities is relying on, or has relied on, any other representations or warranties, either express or implied, with
respect to the Transactions, the Partnership Entities, Holdings or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition,
results of operations, future operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects), or on the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the General Partner, Holdings or the Partnership Group Entities or any other material furnished or provided to the Parent Entities or
made available to the Parent Entities in any “data rooms,” “virtual data rooms,” management presentations or in any other form, in expectation of,
or in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions.

(b) In connection with the due diligence investigation of Partnership Entities by the Parent Entities, the Parent Entities have received and
may continue to receive from the Partnership Entities certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan and cost-related plan information, regarding the Partnership Group Entities, Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities and
their respective businesses and operations. The Parent Entities hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make
such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, with which the Parent Entities are familiar, that the Parent Entities are
taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information, as well as such business plans and cost-related plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related plans), and that the Parent Entities
will have no claim against the Partnership Group Entities, the Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities, or any of their respective equityholders,
directors, managers, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, or any other Person, with respect thereto.

the Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Partnership may postpone or adjourn, with approval
of the General Partner Board after due consideration of the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee, the Shareholder Meeting (i) to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of quorum, and (iii) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee has
determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Shareholders prior to the Shareholder Meeting. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Article VIII, the Partnership, with the cooperation of the Parent Entities, shall submit this Agreement and the Mergers to the Shareholders for
approval at the Shareholder Meeting even if the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change. Upon obtaining the Shareholder Approval, OpCo shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Unitholder
Approval.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Partnership shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy
statement (the “Proxy Statement”) in preliminary form relating to the Shareholder Meeting; provided, however, that Parent and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement before it is filed. Subject to Section 6.3, the Proxy Statement shall
include the Board Recommendation. The Parties shall cooperate with one another in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement.
Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment to the Proxy Statement each time before
it is filed with the SEC. The Partnership shall promptly provide Parent and its counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether
written or oral, that the Partnership or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement
promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the Partnership’s response to
those comments and to provide comments on that response, including by participating with the Partnership or its counsel in any discussions or
meetings with the SEC. Each of the Partnership and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Partnership shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Shareholders as promptly as practicable after the SEC has completed its review of the Proxy Statement. If, at any
time prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, any information relating to the Partnership, the General Partner, OpCo, Parent, Partnership
Merger Sub or OpCo Merger Subs or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the Partnership or Parent that should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Shareholders.

conditioned), the Partnership Entities shall, and shall cause each of the other Partnership Group Entities to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
conduct their business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business (including maintaining the assets of the Partnership Group
Entities in accordance with past practice), to preserve substantially intact their business organizations and to preserve their present relationships
with customers, suppliers and other Persons with which they have material business relations; provided, however, that no action by any of the
Partnership Entities or the other Partnership Group Entities

permitted to have discussions or (y) seek clarification regarding the terms of an Alternative Proposal) concerning, or to provide or cause to be
provided any non-public information or data relating to any of the Partnership Group Entities in connection with, an Alternative Proposal,
(iii) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Laws inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by any Alternative Proposal, or
(iv) resolve or publicly propose or announce to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, it is understood and agreed that any determination or
action by the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee permitted under Section 6.3(b), Section 6.3(c) or Section 8.1(d)(ii) shall not
be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.3(a). The Partnership Entities and Holdings agree that they will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (A) the Partnership may grant a waiver, amendment or release under any
confidentiality agreement, standstill agreement or similar agreement to the extent necessary to allow an Alternative Proposal to be made to the
Partnership or the General Partner Board or any committee thereof (including the GP Conflicts Committee), and (B) the Parties agree that, by
execution of this Agreement, the Partnership shall be deemed to have waived, as of immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, any provision in any such agreement to the extent necessary to allow the applicable counterparty to convey an Alternative Proposal to
the Partnership or the General Partner Board or any committee thereof (including the GP Conflicts Committee).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.3(a), at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership Shareholder Approval, the
Partnership and Holdings may, (i) in response to a Bona Fide Alternative Proposal received after the date of this Agreement and (ii) which the
General Partner Board (after due consideration of the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee) determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside financial and legal advisors) constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (A) furnish
information with respect to the General Partner and the Partnership Group Entities and the Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities to the
Person making such Alternative Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary in order for the Partnership Entities and Holdings to be able to
comply with their obligations under this Agreement and it being understood that the Partnership Entities and Holdings may enter into a
confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision) and (B) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its
Representatives regarding such Alternative Proposal; provided, however, that the Partnership and Holdings shall provide or make available to
Parent any material non-public information concerning the General Partner and the Partnership Group Entities and the Non-Controlled Partnership
Group Entities that is provided to the Person making such Alternative Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made
available to Parent.

shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Parent Entities the Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement distributed to
the Shareholders in connection with the Transactions, or (iv) resolve or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any of such actions, an
“Adverse Recommendation Change”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.3 or any other provision of this Agreement, if,
prior to obtaining the Partnership Shareholder Approval, (A) an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and the General Partner Board
or the GP Conflicts Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, that the consummation of the
Mergers would not be in, or would be adverse to, the best interests of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders or would otherwise be
inconsistent with its duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable Law, then the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee

consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, that (I) such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (II) the consummation
of the Mergers would not be in, or would be adverse to, the best interests of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders or would otherwise
be inconsistent with its duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable Law, then the General Partner Board may effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or the Partnership, upon receiving such authorization from the General Partner Board, may enter into a definitive
acquisition agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) if, with respect to this clause (B), the
Partnership concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii). If the GP Conflicts Committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, that (1) such Alternative Proposal constitutes (or could reasonably be expected to constitute)
a Superior Proposal and (2) the consummation of the Mergers would not be in, or would be adverse to the best interests of the Partnership Group
or the Public Shareholders or would otherwise be inconsistent with its duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable Law and the General
Partner Board does not act consistently with the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee, the GP Conflicts Committee may effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change. The General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee, as applicable, shall not be entitled to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change or authorize the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) unless:

(i) the Partnership notifies Parent in writing at least three Business Days before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies
the reasons therefor, including, if applicable, the identity of the person making the Alternative Proposal;

(ii) to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, the Partnership has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good
faith with Parent and its Representatives during such three Business Day period, to enable Parent to effect revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that would, if a Superior Proposal has been made, cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal or, in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change, it would cause the General Partner Board or the GP
Conflicts Committee to no longer believe that making an Adverse Recommendation Change would be in, or not adverse to, the best interests
of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders or would otherwise be consistent with their duties under the Partnership Agreement or
applicable Law; and

(iii) if Parent makes a proposal during such three Business Day period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee, as applicable, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this
Agreement as proposed by Parent, continue to determine in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that
such Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal, if applicable, and that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
or terminate this Agreement, as applicable, could be adverse to the interests of the Partnership Group or the Public Shareholders or would
otherwise be inconsistent with their duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable Law.

(d) The Partnership promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any written
Alternative Proposal and any written request for non-public information relating to the General Partner and the Partnership Group Entities and the
Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related to an Alternative Proposal,
and, in each case, shall disclose to Parent the identity of the Person making the written Alternative Proposal or request, and in the case of an
Alternative Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal. The Partnership shall, upon the request of Parent, keep
Parent reasonably informed of any material developments with respect to any Alternative Proposal.

(e) Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall prevent the Partnership, the General Partner Board or the GP Conflicts Committee from

promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to Shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender

Section 6.4 Cooperation; Regulatory Approvals.

(a) Except to the extent that the Parties’ obligations are specifically set forth elsewhere in this Article VI, the Parties shall cooperate fully
with each other and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Transactions to be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable
(including by using reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to closing set forth in Article VII to be satisfied). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Parties (i) shall make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made by such Party with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, and shall submit as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information

Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and for the avoidance of doubt, the obligation of this

person, may assert under any applicable Law with respect to the Transactions, and to avoid or eliminate, and minimize the impact of, each and
every impediment under any applicable Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, in each case so
as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date). Holdings, the Partnership
and Parent shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests received from any Governmental Authority in
connection with antitrust or related matters. Each of Holdings, the Partnership and Parent shall (i) give the other Party notice as promptly as

hereunder if any of its Non-U.S. Members declines to provide information that it deems to be proprietary or otherwise not advisable to make

efforts to implement such conditions, restrictions or other actions in order to obtain CFIUS Approval; provided that Parent shall have the ability to
negotiate any such conditions, restrictions and other actions with CFIUS for a reasonable period of time before agreeing to implement any such
conditions, restrictions or other actions; and provided further that Parent shall not be required to agree to any such conditions, restrictions or other
actions that require any action or concession be taken or made by, any of its direct or indirect owners (including the Non-U.S. Members) or
require any such direct or indirect owner to approve a matter relating to its investment in CD CEI V JV Holdco or any of the other Parent Entities

director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the General Partner or any Partnership Group Entity whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or
after the Partnership Merger Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law but subject to any limitations and exclusions of
any such indemnity as set forth in the General Partner LLC Agreement, the Partnership Agreement or the OpCo LLC Agreement (or in the

Holdco, the General Partner, the Partnership or OpCo to indemnify any Indemnified Person to the extent of such Indemnified Person’s fraud or
willful misconduct. In the event of any Proceeding in which an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, (i) Parent, the General Partner and the Surviving Entities shall pay, as incurred, the fees and expenses of the Indemnified
Person, in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and, if required, upon receipt

Person is not entitled to indemnification, and (ii) Parent, the General Partner and the Surviving Entities will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter; provided that none of Parent, the General Partner or the Surviving Entities shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment

(c) Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Partnership Entities will purchase a single-premium pre-paid “tail policy” for a
period of six years from the Closing Date having coverage terms, benefits, levels of coverage (including limits, self-insured retentions and
deductibles) and other terms and conditions which are in the aggregate not less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons as those in effect under
the director and officer insurance policies (the “D&O Insurance”) of the Partnership Group Entities or the General Partner as of immediately prior
to the Closing. Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the General Partner and the Surviving Entities. If the Partnership Entities for any reason fail to obtain such “tail policy” as of the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, the General Partner and the Surviving Entities shall, and Parent shall cause the General Partner and the
Surviving Entities to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time the
D&O Insurance in place as of immediately prior to the Closing having coverage terms, benefits, levels of coverage (including limits, self-insured
retentions and deductibles) and other terms and conditions which are in the aggregate not less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons as of
immediately prior to the Closing, or the General Partner and the Surviving Entities shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entities to, use
reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period having coverage benefits, levels of coverage (including
limits, self-insured retentions and deductibles) and other terms and conditions which are in the aggregate not less advantageous to the Indemnified
Persons as of immediately prior to the Closing; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent, the General Partner or the Surviving Entities be
required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Partnership
Entities for such insurance; and, provided further that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the General Partner
and the Surviving Entities shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this Section 6.7 will be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have
under the Organizational Documents of the Partnership Group Entities or the General Partner, any Contract with any Partnership Group Entity or
the General Partner, the DRULPA or the DLLCA. The provisions of this Section 6.7 will survive the Closing Date for a period of six years and are
expressly intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs, successors, assigns,
executors and administrators; provided, however, that in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification set forth in this Section 6.7 are
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims will continue until disposition of
all such claims. If Parent, the General Partner, the Surviving Entities or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in each such
case, to the extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the General Partner or the Surviving
Entities, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of Parent, the General Partner and the Surviving Entities set forth in this Section  6.7.

Section 6.8 Transaction Litigation. The Partnership Entities and Holdings will give the Parent Entities prompt notice of any Proceeding
commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Partnership Entities, threatened, against any of them or their respective directors, officers, managers, partners or
Affiliates relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (collectively, “Transaction Litigation”) and shall keep the Parent Entities reasonably informed
with respect to the status thereof (including by promptly furnishing to Parent and its Representatives such information relating to such Proceeding as
may be reasonably requested). The Partnership Entities and Holdings shall reasonably consult with the Parent Entities regarding the defense or
settlement of any Transaction Litigation and shall not compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to
an arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the same, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that the Partnership Entities and Holdings may at any time, without Parent’s consent, settle
such Transaction Litigation pursuant to settlements providing solely for (i) money damages and the payment of attorney’s fees in an aggregate amount
not in excess of amounts equal to the dollar amount of the limits of the

the Code not to, make any available election under Section 6226 of the Code to the extent such election would adversely affect Sponsors as a
result of taxable items or events arising after the Closing that are not related to the Transactions. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence,
Parent and its Affiliates (including OpCo) shall not be precluded from making any available election under Section 6226 of the Code.

(f) The Parties shall cause OpCo to have a valid election in effect under Section 754 of the Code for any taxable period which includes the
Closing Date and shall not revoke such election without the consent of Parent.

(g) The Parties agree that the OpCo Merger Consideration (plus any applicable liabilities for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) will be
allocated among the underlying assets of OpCo (and, to the extent applicable, the Subsidiaries of OpCo or the other Equity Securities owned by
OpCo) for purposes of Sections 743(b), 751, 755 and 1060 of the Code and the statements required to be filed under Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.751-1(a)(3) and 1.743-1(k) (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, as applicable) (the “OpCo Merger Consideration
Allocation”). Within 45 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall provide the Sponsors with a proposed OpCo Merger Consideration Allocation.
Within 30 days after the date of the delivery of such proposed allocation to the Sponsors, the Sponsors shall propose to Parent any changes to such
allocation in writing or otherwise shall be deemed to have agreed with such allocation upon the expiration of such 30 day period. The Sponsors
and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to mutually agree to such allocation and shall reduce such agreement to writing. The Parties shall file
timely any forms and statements required under U.S. federal or state income Laws with respect to Taxes consistent with such OpCo Merger
Consideration Allocation. The Parties shall not file any Tax Return or otherwise take any position with respect to Taxes which is inconsistent with
such OpCo Merger Consideration Allocation, except as required by a final “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code or any
similar state Law.

(h) Parent and the Partnership Entities shall each be liable for and shall pay one-half of any transfer, conveyance, documentary, sales, use,
registration, stamp, excise, value-added or other similar Taxes payable by reason of the Transactions (“Transfer Taxes”). The Party responsible
under applicable Tax Law for submitting payment of such Transfer Taxes to the applicable taxing authority shall file all necessary returns, reports
or other filings with respect to all such Taxes. Should a Partnership Entity or any other Person be responsible for submitting payment of a Transfer
Tax for which Parent is responsible under this Section 6.15(h), Parent shall either (i) provide such Person with the funds necessary to pay such
Transfer Tax at least five (5) days before such Transfer Tax is due, or (ii) if such Person waives the requirement in (i), promptly reimburse such
Person for such Transfer Tax.

Section 6.16 Financing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (i) Parent shall take all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things, necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the Equity Funds, and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter (including the flex provisions), and shall not consent to any assignment of
the commitments set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter to which it has a consent right without the Partnership’s prior written consent or permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or consent to any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee
Letter, if such amendment, modification, consent or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) from that contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter to an amount that, together with Equity
Funds received by Parent, would not enable Parent to meets its payment obligations under this Agreement, including under Article II, or (B) impose new
or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing or any other
terms in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (1) delay or prevent the Closing, (2) make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the Debt Financing
Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter. For purposes of clarification, the foregoing shall not prohibit Parent from amending the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Debt Fee Letter to add additional lender(s) (and Affiliates of such additional lender(s)) as a party thereto so long as the addition of such
lenders would not reasonably be expected to (x) delay or prevent the Closing, (y) make the timely funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur or (z) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the Debt Financing
Sources under the Debt Commitment Letter (with any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt Financing Sources” being deemed to include such
additional lender(s)). Any reference in this Agreement to (a) “Debt Financing” shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
as amended or modified in compliance with this Section 6.16 and (b) “Debt Commitment Letter” shall include such documents as amended or modified
in compliance with this Section 6.16.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms, (B) negotiate and enter into, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event before the Closing),
all definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter (including the flex provisions), (C) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to the consummation of the
Debt Financing that are applicable to Parent or its Affiliates including the payment of any commitment, engagement, placement or other fees or
expenses required as a condition to the Debt Financing, and consummate the portion of the Debt Financing required for the Closing, as applicable, at or
prior to such Closing, (D) deliver a private placement memorandum as required by the Debt Commitment Letter on or before March 7, 2018, (E)
comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Fee Letter and any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing,
(F) cause the proceeds of any issuance of notes, borrowings of loans or consummation of any other debt financing that has the effect of reducing the
principal amount of funds available under the Debt Commitment Letter, and that are expected to be received prior to the Closing Date, to be deposited
by the financing sources thereof into an escrow account and pursuant to

escrow arrangements that are not subject to any conditions more onerous than the Debt Commitment Letter, (G) diligently and in good faith enforce its
rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing, including (upon a good faith request of the
Partnership) by filing one or more lawsuits against the Debt Financing Sources to fully enforce the Debt Financing Sources’ obligations (and the rights
of Parent and its Affiliates) thereunder in the event of a breach by the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter, (H) in the event that all conditions in
the Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied, cause the Debt Financing Sources to fund on the Closing Date the Debt Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and (I) cause the Debt Financing Proceeds to be contributed to OpCo Merger
Sub 1 on the Closing Date. Parent shall refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of
(x) any of the conditions related to the Debt Financing or (y) the Equity Funds to be unavailable to Parent for purposes of satisfying its payment
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date.

(c) Parent shall keep the Partnership informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing and provide to the Partnership copies of all executed definitive documents related to the Debt Financing (provided that the Debt Fee
Letter may be redacted as contemplated by Section 5.9 and to omit the numerical fee amounts and certain other commercially sensitive numbers and
provisions set forth therein). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Partnership prompt notice (i) of any breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive document related to the Debt Financing of which Parent becomes
aware, (ii) of the receipt by Parent of any notice or other communication from any Person with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing, of any provisions of
the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing and (iii) of the occurrence of any event or development
that Parent expects to have a material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent to obtain on a timely basis all or any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive documents related to the Debt Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within three calendar days of the date the
Partnership delivers Parent a written request, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Partnership relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter (including the flex provisions), Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain as promptly as practicable alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions that do not contain
conditions to funding that are materially more adverse, in the aggregate, to Parent than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee
Letter, and in an amount at least equal to the amount of the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the “Alternative
Debt Financing”), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect to such Alternative Debt Financing (the “New Debt Commitment
Letter”) which shall replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter, a true, complete and correct copy of which (together with the Debt Fee Letter) shall
be promptly provided to the Partnership. In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the “Debt
Financing” shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in
this Agreement to the “Debt Commitment Letter” shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters that are not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter at the time in question and the New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, (iii) any reference in this Agreement to
“Debt Fee Letter” shall be deemed to include any fee letter relating to the Debt Commitment Letters that are not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter at the time in question and any fee letter relating to New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect and (iv) any reference
in this Agreement to the “Debt Financing Sources” shall be deemed to include the parties thereto providing such Alternative Debt Financing.

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that it is not a condition to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this Agreement that
Parent obtain financing (including the Equity Funds and the Debt Financing) for, or related to, any of the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Debt Financing or the Equity Funds have not been obtained, Parent shall continue to be obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the applicable

specific performance or other equitable remedies in the event that the Parent Termination Fee is paid), to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 6.17 Financing Cooperation. The Partnership agrees to provide reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement and
consummation of, and the negotiation of agreements with respect to, the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt Financing. In furtherance of and not
in limitation of the foregoing, the Partnership shall (a) cause the management of the Partnership, OpCo and their respective Subsidiaries to be reasonably
available, on reasonable advance notice, to Parent and the Debt Financing Sources providing the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt Financing to
participate in due diligence sessions, (b) assist in the preparation of one or more appropriate and customary offering documents and assisting Parent and
the Debt Financing Sources providing the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt Financing in preparing other appropriate and customary marketing
materials, in each case to be used in connection with the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt Financing, and (c) request the independent auditors
with respect to the Partnership, OpCo and their respective Subsidiaries to prepare and deliver “comfort letters,” dated the date of each offering document
used in connection with any transaction in connection with the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt Financing (with appropriate bring down
comfort letters delivered on the closing date of the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt Financing), in compliance with professional standards and
otherwise on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent, as the case may be, in each of the foregoing cases as may be necessary and customary in connection
with a financing substantially similar to the Debt Financing and any Alternative Debt Financing; provided, however, that the Partnership shall be
reimbursed promptly (and in any event with 10 Business Days of providing invoices to Parent) by Parent for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Partnership in connection with the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.17 shall require (i) any
officer, employee, director or consultant of the Partnership, OpCo or any of their respective Subsidiaries to participate in any way with any Debt
Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing, any capital markets transactions conducted by or on behalf of Parent, any due diligence sessions,
management presentations, roadshows or other marketing activities in connection with any Debt Financing, Alternative Debt Financing or any other
capital markets transactions or related transactions by Parent in connection with financing the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
(ii) the Partnership or any management of the Partnership, OpCo or any of their respective Subsidiaries to engage in any action that would interfere
unreasonably with the business of the Partnership, OpCo and their respective Subsidiaries, or (iii) the Partnership, OpCo or any of their respective
Affiliates to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with any Debt Financing or any Alternative Debt
Financing; provided, however, that the General Partner, the Partnership and OpCo exercise reasonable efforts to make their respective management
reasonably available in connection with their obligation to provide reasonable cooperation to the Parent pursuant to this Section 6.17. Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, OpCo and their respective Affiliates and their respective directors, officers and employees from and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement and completion of any Debt Financing or any Alternative
Debt Financing, capital markets transactions or related transactions by Parent in connection with financing the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents and any information utilized in connection therewith except with respect to information in respect of the Partnership, OpCo and
their respective Subsidiaries supplied by the Partnership and its Representatives specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein, to the
extent such Losses are not caused by a breach by the General Partner, Partnership or OpCo of this Agreement or otherwise caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the General Partner, Partnership, OpCo or any of their respective Affiliates.

(d) Limitation of Liability.

right, if any, to receive the Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement pursuant to Section 8.2(b) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parent Entities and their respective Affiliates against Holdings, the Partnership Entities, their respective Subsidiaries, the

Affiliates, agents or other Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or
the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of Holdings, the Partnership Entities, their
respective Subsidiaries, the Non-Controlled Partnership Group Entities or any of their respective former, current or future stockholders,
directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions. Except as set forth in Section 8.2(a), under no circumstances shall the aggregate amount of damages payable

Table of Contents

breaches under this Agreement or any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement, exceed the amounts specified in Section 8.2(b).
Since the Partnership is a publicly traded entity, any claim against the Partnership will likely adversely affect its trading price, and any claim
brought against the Partnership Entities in excess of the amounts provided above shall result in a waiver by Parent and its Affiliates to assert
any claim hereunder.

(ii) Except as set forth in Section 8.2(a), upon termination of this Agreement for the circumstances described in Section 8.2(c), the
Partnership Group Entities’ right, if any, to receive the Parent Termination Fee or the Partnership Expense Reimbursement pursuant to
Section 8.2(c) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Partnership Group Entities and their respective Affiliates against the Parent
Entities their respective Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future equityholders, directors, managers, officers,
Affiliates, agents or other Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or
the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent Entities, their respective Subsidiaries
or any of their respective former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. Except as set forth in Section 8.2(a), under no
circumstances shall the aggregate amount of damages payable by Parent Entities and any of their respective former, current or future
equityholders, directors, managers, officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives in respect of breaches under this Agreement or any
claim arising out of or related to this Agreement, exceed the amounts specified in Section 8.2(c).

(iii) The provisions of Section 8.2(b), Section 8.2(c) and Section 8.2(d)(i) and (ii) are an integral part of the Transactions and, without
such provisions, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that the payment of the Termination Fee, the Parent Expense Reimbursement, the Parent Termination Fee or the Partnership
Expense Reimbursement is not a penalty but instead is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that shall compensate the Parent Entities
or the Partnership Entities, and their respective Affiliates in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee, the Parent Expense
Reimbursement, the Parent Termination Fee or the Partnership Expense Reimbursement is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

(e) Recoverable Damages. The Parent Entities acknowledge and agree that, without in any way limiting the rights of the Partnership Entities
under Section 9.9, recoverable damages of the Partnership Entities under this Agreement shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs but shall also include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Shareholders and the Unitholders (including “lost premium”),
taking into consideration relevant matters, including the total amount payable to the Shareholders and the Unitholders under this Agreement and
the time value of money, which, in each case, shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Partnership Entities and shall be recoverable by
the Partnership Entities on behalf of the Shareholders and the Unitholders.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Transaction Document to the contrary, each Partnership Entity agrees (on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates) that it will not bring or support any Proceeding (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any
Persons (other than the Parent Entities) that have committed to provide or otherwise enter into Contracts in connection with the Debt Financing,
and the Debt Financing Sources shall have no liability or obligations to any Partnership Entity or any of their Affiliates hereunder, arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Fee Letter, the definitive agreements with respect thereto or the Debt
Financing. In addition, in no event will any Debt Financing Source be liable to any Person for consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or
indirect damages (including any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious nature.

ARTICLE IX
MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1 No Survival, Etc. This Article IX and the agreements contained in Article II, Section 6.7 and Section 6.10 shall survive the
consummation of the Mergers. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, the representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement will
terminate at the Partnership Merger Effective Time, other than those covenants or agreements of the Parties which by their terms apply, or are to be
performed as a whole or in part, after the Partnership Merger Effective Time. The Confidentiality Agreement will (i) survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

Section 9.2 Amendment or Modification. At any time prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or
modified in any and all respects, whether before or after receipt of the Shareholder Approval, only by written agreement of the Parties; provided,
however, that none of the General Partner, the Partnership or OpCo may take or authorize any such amendment or modification unless the General
Partner Board has first referred such action to the GP Conflicts Committee for its consideration and the GP Conflicts Committee has approved such
amendment or modification; provided further, that after the Shareholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made that, pursuant to
applicable Law or the General Partner’s or the Partnership’s governing documents, requires further approval or adoption by the Shareholders without
such further approval or adoption; provided further, at all time no amendments or modifications of, or supplements to, Section 6.17, Section 8.2(f), this
Section 9.2, Section 9.4, Section 9.7 and Section 9.8 (and no definition set forth in this Agreement to the extent that an amendment, supplement or
modification of such definition would amend, supplement or waive the substance of such sections) that affect the Debt Financing Sources shall be
effective without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any
manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf
of each of the Parties (or, if applicable pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Debt Financing Sources).

Section 9.3 Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, any Party may, subject to applicable Law,
(a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other Party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any other Party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other Party with any of the agreements contained herein or, except as
otherwise provided herein, waive any of such Party’s conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in addition to any approvals required by General
Partner’s or the Partnership’s governing documents or under this Agreement or any Transaction Document, any such waiver or extension of any
Partnership Entity must be approved by the GP Conflicts Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any Partnership Entity or
any Parent Entity in exercising any right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver will be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.

Section 9.4 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties, except that Parent, Partnership Merger Sub
and each OpCo Merger Sub may assign, in their respective sole discretion, any or all of their respective rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement (a) to one or more controlled Affiliates of such Party, or (b) to any of their financing sources (including the Debt Financing Sources) as
collateral security, but no such assignment will relieve Parent, Partnership Merger Sub or either OpCo Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 9.4 will be null and void.

Section 9.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken

and delivered to the other Parties.

receive the Merger Consideration and the OpCo Merger 1 OpCo Distribution and (c) Section 6.17, Section 8.2(f), Section 9.2, Section 9.4, this
Section 9.7 and Section 9.8, which will insure to the benefit of the Debt Financing Sources, who are expressly intended to be third party beneficiaries

negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other

date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto agree that (a) none of the Partnership Group Entities or any Parent Entity shall bring or support any Financing Claim in any forum other

extent permitted by law any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any Financing Claim in any such court and (e) agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any such Financing Claim shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court
other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, including any Financing Claim, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 9.8, (ii) any claim that it or
its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (x) the Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING ANY
FINANCING CLAIM. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.8(c).

Section 9.9 Specific Enforcement. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate
remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and it is accordingly agreed, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.16(e), Section 8.2(d) and as otherwise set forth below, that the
Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in each case, in accordance with this Section 9.9 in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) any Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each Party further agrees that no Party will be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.9, and
each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. For the
avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall (i) the Parent Entities be permitted or entitled to receive more than one of a grant of specific
performance in accordance with this Section 9.9, the Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, in respect of the same
underlying claim; and (ii) the Partnership Entities be permitted or entitled to receive more than one of a grant of specific performance in accordance with

event that all of the conditions in Section 8.1(d)(iii) have been satisfied and the General Partner would be entitled to terminate this Agreement, and such
failure by the Parent to consummate the Closing is due to the failure to obtain the funds contemplated to be provided pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letter (or any New Debt Commitment Letter), or any other failure of the proceeds of the Debt Financing or Alternative Debt Financing to be made
available to the Parent (except, in each case, if such failure to obtain the funds pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter (or any New Debt Commitment
Letter) or the proceeds of the Debt Financing or Alternative Debt Financing is due to the failure of the Equity Funds to be provided as required by the
Debt Commitment Letter (or any New Debt Commitment Letter), the General Partner and the Partnership Entities shall have no right to pursue (or
continue pursuing) specific performance in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Section 9.9 and the sole remedy of the
General Partner and the Partnership Entities shall be to terminate the Agreement and receive of the Parent Termination Fee.

Table of Contents

3. Parties in Interest. This Agreement is binding upon and is for the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. This Agreement is not made for the benefit of any Person not a Party, and no Person other than the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns will acquire or have any benefit, right, remedy or claim under or by virtue of this Agreement.

 

4. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of
Law or otherwise, by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that Assignee may assign, in its sole discretion, any
or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement (a) to one or more controlled Affiliates of Assignee, or (b) to any of its financing
sources (including the Debt Financing Sources) as collateral security, but no such assignment will relieve Assignee of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section 4 will be null and void.

 

5. Waiver. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, delay in exercising, or single or partial exercise of any
right, power or remedy by any Party, and no course of dealing between the Parties, shall constitute a waiver of any such right, power or remedy.
No waiver by a Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the Party against whom such waiver is
sought to be enforced.

 

6. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or
any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as
may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 

7. Governing Law. This Agreement and the legal relations between the Parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, USA without regard to any principles of conflicts of Laws of any other jurisdiction.

 

8. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and [General Partner LLC Agreement]/[OpCo LLC Agreement] constitute
the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede other prior agreements and
understandings both written and oral among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and [General Partner LLC Agreement]/[OpCo LLC Agreement], read as a whole, set forth the Parties’ rights,
responsibilities and liabilities with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In this Agreement, specific provisions prevail over
general provisions. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to supersede, enlarge, restrict or modify any of the provisions of any of the
Transaction Documents or [General Partner LLC Agreement]/[OpCo LLC Agreement], and the rights, obligations and liabilities of the relevant
parties thereunder, all of which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement as provided in, and subject to the limitations set forth
in, the Transaction Documents and [General Partner LLC Agreement]/[OpCo LLC Agreement]. The Merger Agreement shall control in the event
of any conflict with the terms of this Agreement.

 

9. Amendment. This Agreement may be modified, amended or supplemented only by written agreement executed by the Parties.

10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (delivery of which may occur via facsimile or other electronic
means), each of which shall be binding as of the date first written above, and, when delivered, all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement and any documents delivered pursuant hereto, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or as an attachment to an electronic mail message in “pdf” or similar format, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or electronic mail attachment in “pdf” or similar
format to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a
facsimile machine or as an attachment to an electronic mail message, as a defense to the formation of a contract and each such Party forever
waives any such defense. A facsimile signature or electronically scanned copy of a signature shall constitute and shall be deemed to be sufficient
evidence of a Party’s execution of this Agreement, without necessity of further proof. Each such copy shall be deemed an original, and it shall not
be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account for more than one such counterpart.

Annex B

February 5, 2018

Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of
8point3 General Partner, LLC
77 Rio Robles
San Jose, California 95134

Members of the Conflicts Committee:

We understand that 8point3 Energy Partners LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Partnership”), 8point3 General Partner, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and the general partner of the Partnership (the “General Partner”), 8point3 Holding Company, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (“Holdings”), and 8point3 Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“OpCo” and, together with the
Partnership, the General Partner and Holdings, the “8point3 Entities”), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Purchase Agreement
to be dated on or about February 2, 2018 (the “Merger Agreement”), with 8point3 Solar CEI, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“CEI SPV”),
8point3 Co-Investment Feeder 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“InvestorCo1”), 8point3 Co-Invest Feeder 2, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (“InvestorCo2”), CD Clean Energy and Infrastructure V JV (Holdco), LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“CD CEI V JV
Holdco” and, together with CEI SPV, InvestorCo1 and InvestorCo2, collectively, the “Acquirors”), 8point3 Partnership Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of CEI SPV (“Partnership Merger Sub”), 8point3 OpCo Merger Sub 1, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and wholly owned Subsidiary of Acquirors (“OpCo Merger Sub 1”), pursuant to which, among other actions, the Partnership Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Partnership (the “Merger”) and each Class A Share representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (each, a
“Class A Share”) that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive $12.35 in
cash as adjusted in accordance with the Merger Agreement pursuant to the mechanics set forth in the definition of Share Merger Consideration set forth
therein (as adjusted, the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

The Conflicts Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the General Partner has asked us whether, in our opinion, as of the date
hereof, the Consideration to be paid by the Acquirors pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Partnership and the
holders of the Class A Shares other than the General Partner, First Solar, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“First Solar”), SunPower Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (“SunPower”), and their affiliates (collectively, the “Unaffiliated Shareholders”).

In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:

(i) reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to the Partnership and OpCo that we deemed to
be relevant, including the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016 and certain Current
Reports on Form 8-K, in each case, as filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by the Partnership since
December 1, 2016;

(ii) reviewed certain non-public historical financial and operating data relating to the Partnership and OpCo provided to us by management
of the Partnership;

(iii) reviewed certain non-public projected financial and operating data relating to the Partnership and OpCo that were provided to us by
management of the Partnership and sensitivity cases prepared by us that were recommended and approved by management of the
Partnership;

(iv) discussed the historical and current operations, financial projections and current financial condition of the Partnership and OpCo with
management of the Partnership (including such managements’ views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving such projections);

Table of Contents

(v) reviewed publicly available research analyst estimates for the Partnership’s future financial performance on a standalone basis;

(vi) performed discounted cash flow analyses based on projected financial data and other data of the Partnership and OpCo provided by
management of the Partnership;

(vii) reviewed the reported prices and historical trading activity of the Class A Shares;

(viii) compared the financial performance of the Partnership with the stock market trading multiples of certain publicly traded companies
that we deemed relevant based on various metrics;

(ix) reviewed certain historical transactions that we deemed relevant;

(x) reviewed a draft, dated February 5, 2018, of the Merger Agreement; and

(xi) performed such other analyses and examinations, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we deemed
appropriate for purposes of providing the opinion contained herein.

For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without undertaking any independent verification of, the accuracy
and completeness of all of the information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or
reviewed by us, and we assume no liability therefor. With respect to the projected financial and operating data relating to the Partnership and OpCo
referred to above, we have assumed that such data has been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith
judgments of management of the Partnership as to the future financial performance of the Partnership and OpCo, as applicable, under the business
assumptions reflected therein. We express no view as to any projected financial and operating data or any judgments, estimates or assumptions on which
they are based. We have relied at your direction, without independent verification, upon the assessments of the management of the Partnership as to the
future financial and operating performance of the Partnership and OpCo. In addition, we have not produced any retail or wholesale market electricity
forecasts and are not experts in such and have relied, with your consent, upon electricity forecasts provided by management of the Partnership.

For purposes of rendering our opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the Merger Agreement and related
documents that have been reviewed by us will be executed and delivered (in the draft form reviewed by us), that the representations and warranties of
each party contained in the Merger Agreement (in the draft form reviewed by us) are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants
and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger and the related
transactions in the Merger Agreement will be satisfied without material waiver or modification thereof. We have further assumed that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Merger and the related transactions in the Merger Agreement
will be obtained without any material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Partnership or the Unaffiliated
Shareholders or the consummation of the Merger and the related transactions in the Merger Agreement or materially reduce the benefits of the Merger to
the Unaffiliated Shareholders.

We have not made nor assumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Partnership
or OpCo, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Partnership or OpCo under any
state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to us as of
the date hereof and financial, economic, monetary, market, regulatory and other conditions and circumstances as they exist and as can be evaluated on
the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or
reaffirm this opinion.

Table of Contents

We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than whether the Consideration is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the Partnership and the Unaffiliated Shareholders. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, the
fairness of the proposed Consideration to, or any consideration paid or received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other securities, creditors
or other constituencies of the 8point3 Entities nor any view as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any
of the officers, directors or employees of the 8point3 Entities, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Consideration or otherwise. We have
assumed that any modification to the structure of the Merger and the related transactions in the Merger Agreement will not vary in any respect material
to our analysis. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be
available to the Partnership, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the Partnership to engage in the Merger. In arriving at our opinion,
we were not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any third party with respect to the acquisition of any or all of the limited partner
interests in the Partnership or any business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving the Partnership. This letter, and our opinion, does
not constitute a recommendation to the Committee or to any other persons in respect of the Merger, including as to how any holders of Class A Shares
should vote or act in respect of the Merger. We express no opinion herein as to the price at which the Class A Shares will trade at any time. We are not
legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and have assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by the Partnership and its advisors with
respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.

We received an initial fee for our services and will receive an additional fee upon the rendering of this opinion and upon the closing of the Merger.
The Partnership has also agreed to reimburse our expenses and to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. In 2017, we
provided financial advisory services to the Committee with respect to the proposed acquisitions of interests in the California Flats project located in
California from First Solar, the Cuyama project located in California from First Solar, the residential lease asset portfolio located in the United States
from SunPower and the Switch Station project located in Nevada from First Solar for which we received fees and reimbursement of certain
out-of-pocket expenses. In 2016, we provided financial advisory services to the Committee with respect to the acquisitions of interests in the Henrietta
Project from SunPower, the Stateline Project in California from First Solar, SunPower Commercial II Class B, LLC, SunPower Commercial III Class B,
LLC and SSCO III Class B Holdings, LLC, by a subsidiary of OpCo from a subsidiary of SunPower, and the acquisition of FSAM Kingbird Solar
Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of First Solar, by a subsidiary of OpCo, for which we received fees and reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses.
Except as described herein, during the two-year period prior to the date hereof, no material relationship existed between Evercore Group L.L.C. or any
of its affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the 8point3 Entities or any of their respective affiliates or any of the Acquirors or any of their respective
affiliates, on the other hand, pursuant to which compensation was or is intended to be received by Evercore Group L.L.C. or any of its affiliates as a
result of such relationship. We may provide financial or other services to the 8point3 Entities and the Acquirors and any of their respective affiliates in
the future and in connection with any such services we may receive compensation.

Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates engage in a wide range of activities for their own accounts and the accounts of customers. In connection
with these businesses or otherwise, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates and their respective employees, as well as investment funds in which any of
them may have a financial interest, at any time, directly or indirectly hold long or short positions and may trade or otherwise effect transactions for their
own accounts or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities, senior loans and/or derivative products relating to the Partnership and its
affiliates, and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or instruments.

or to such other address as will be furnished in writing by any such Party to the other Party in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8(e).

(f) Severability. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not affect
the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (i) a suitable and equitable provision will be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid
and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (ii) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or unenforceability affect
the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

(g) Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and it
is accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with this Section 8(g) and Section 8(j), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (i) either Party has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each Party further agrees that no Party will be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8(g), and each Party irrevocably waives any right it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

(h) No Waiver. The failure of or delay by any Party in exercising any right hereunder will not operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a Party
to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.

(i) No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or
remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

(j) Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(i) This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising
out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) will
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to Contracts executed in and to be performed entirely
within that State.

(ii) By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with respect to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the
rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns, will be brought and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the Parties irrevocably submits with regard
to any such Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid
courts. Each of the Parties irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (A) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this Section 8(j)(ii), (B) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (C) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (x) the Proceeding in such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced
in or by such courts.

(iii) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
