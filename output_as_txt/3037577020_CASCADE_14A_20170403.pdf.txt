MERGER PROPOSAL—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Cascade Bancorp, which we refer to in this document as “Cascade,” and First Interstate BancSystem, Inc., which we refer to in this document as
“First Interstate,” have entered into a merger agreement under which Cascade will merge with and into First Interstate, with First Interstate as the
surviving entity. This transaction is referred to in this document as the “merger.” Immediately following the merger, Bank of the Cascades, which we
refer to in this document as “Cascade Bank,” the wholly-owned subsidiary of Cascade, will merge with and into First Interstate Bank, the wholly-
owned subsidiary of First Interstate, with First Interstate Bank as the surviving entity. This transaction is referred to in this document as the “bank
merger.” Before we can complete the merger, the shareholders of Cascade and First Interstate must approve and adopt the merger agreement.

If the merger is completed, each share of Cascade common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.14864 shares of First Interstate
Class A common stock and $1.91 in cash, without interest. Based on the number of shares of Cascade common stock outstanding on March 17, 2017,
First Interstate expects to issue approximately 11,327,284 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock in the merger. Although the number of
shares of First Interstate Class A common stock that holders of Cascade common stock will be entitled to receive is fixed, the market value of the
stock consideration will fluctuate with the market price of First Interstate Class A common stock and will not be known at the time Cascade
shareholders vote on the merger agreement.

The First Interstate Class A common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “FIBK.” The closing price of First
Interstate Class A common stock on November 17, 2016, the day the merger agreement was signed, was $38.40, which, based on the 0.14864
exchange ratio and $1.91 in cash, represented a value of $7.62 per share of Cascade common stock, or total merger consideration of $581.1 million.
The closing price of First Interstate Class A common stock on April 5, 2017, the most recent practicable trading day before the date of this document,
was $38.50, which represented a value of $7.63 per share of Cascade common stock based on the exchange ratio and cash consideration, or total
merger consideration of $581.9 million. The market prices for both Cascade common stock and First Interstate Class A common stock will fluctuate
before the merger. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for both Cascade common stock and First Interstate Class A common stock.

4:00 p.m., local time   4:30 p.m., local time

The board of directors of each of First Interstate and Cascade has unanimously determined that the merger is in the best interests of its
respective shareholders and recommends that its respective shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement and “FOR” the approval of the other proposals described in this document.

This document contains information that you should consider in evaluating the proposed merger. In particular, you should
carefully read the section captioned “Risk Factors” beginning on page 16 for a discussion of certain risk factors relating to the
merger. You can also obtain information about First Interstate and Cascade from documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

and adoption of the merger agreement, “FOR” the approval of the non-binding resolution approving the compensation that will or
may become payable to the named executive officers of Cascade in connection with the merger, “FOR” the approval on a
non-binding advisory basis of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate and “FOR” the proposal to
adjourn the meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies on the proposal to approve and adopt the merger
agreement.

 
Q: Why do Cascade and First Interstate want to merge?
 

A: Cascade believes that the proposed merger will provide Cascade shareholders with substantial benefits, and First Interstate
believes that the merger will further its strategic growth plans, enhance its geographic diversity and provide access to attractive
markets. As a larger company, First Interstate can provide a broader array of products and services to better serve its banking
customers. For more information about the reasons for the merger, see “Description of the Merger—First Interstate’s Reasons for
the Merger” on page 77 and “Description of the Merger—Background of and Cascade’s Reasons for the Merger” on page 55.

 
Q: What equity stake will Cascade shareholders hold in First Interstate immediately following the merger?
 

A: Following completion of the merger, current First Interstate shareholders will own in the aggregate approximately 65.9% of the
outstanding shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and 80.0% of the aggregate outstanding shares of First Interstate
Class A common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock which we refer to collectively in this document as “First
Interstate common stock.” Immediately following completion of the merger, Cascade shareholders will own approximately 34.1%
of the outstanding shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and 20.0% of the aggregate outstanding shares of First
Interstate common stock, which equates to 7.6% of the voting power of First Interstate common stock.

 
Q: What will Cascade shareholders be entitled to receive in the merger?
 

A: Upon the completion of the merger, each share of Cascade common stock that you own immediately prior to the completion of the
merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.14864 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and $1.91 in cash,
without interest, which we refer to in this document as the “merger consideration.” The closing price of First Interstate Class A
common stock on November 17, 2016, the day the merger agreement was signed, was $38.40, which, based on the 0.14864
exchange ratio and $1.91 in cash, represented a value of $7.62 per share of Cascade common stock, or total merger consideration
of $581.1 million. The closing price of First Interstate Class A common stock on April 5, 2017, the most recent practicable trading
day before the date of this document, was $38.50, which represented a value of $7.63 per share of Cascade common stock based
on the exchange ratio and cash

consideration, or total merger consideration of $581.9 million. The market prices for both Cascade common stock and First
Interstate Class A common stock will fluctuate before the merger. The exchange ratio will not be adjusted as a result of any
change in the trading price of First Interstate Class A common stock or Cascade common stock.

 
Q: What happens if I am eligible to receive a fraction of a share of First Interstate Class A common stock as part of the stock

merger consideration?
 

A: If the aggregate number of shares of First Interstate Class A common stock that you are entitled to receive as part of the stock
merger consideration includes a fraction of a share of First Interstate Class A common stock, you will receive cash instead of that
fractional share. See the section entitled “Description of the Merger Agreement—Consideration to be Received in the
Merger” beginning on page 55 of this document.

 
Q: Will First Interstate pay dividends after the merger?
 

A: First Interstate currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. Although First Interstate has paid quarterly dividends on its
common stock without interruption for over 25 years, there is no guarantee that First Interstate will continue to pay dividends on
its common stock or will continue to pay dividends at the same rate. All dividends on First Interstate common stock are declared
at the discretion of First Interstate’s board of directors.

 
Q: How do Cascade shareholders exchange their stock certificates?
 

A: Shortly after the merger, First Interstate’s exchange agent will send instructions to Cascade’s shareholders on how and where to
surrender their Cascade stock certificates after the merger is completed. Please do not send your Cascade stock certificates
with your proxy card.

 
Q: Are Cascade’s shareholders entitled to appraisal rights?
 

A: No. Because Cascade common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market, Oregon law does not provide for appraisal rights in
connection with the merger. Cascade is incorporated under Oregon law.

 
Q: Is completion of the merger subject to any conditions besides shareholder approval?
 

A: Yes. The merger must receive the required regulatory approvals, and there are other customary closing conditions that must be
satisfied. For more information about the conditions to the completion of the merger, see “Description of the Merger—Conditions
to Completing the Merger” on page 101 of this document.

 
Q: When is the merger expected to be completed?
 

A: We will complete the merger as soon as possible. Before that happens, the merger agreement must be approved and adopted by
First Interstate’s shareholders and Cascade’s shareholders, the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate
must be approved by First Interstate’s shareholders and we must obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, among other
conditions. Assuming timely receipt of regulatory and shareholder approvals, we expect to complete the merger early in the third
quarter of 2017.

 
Q: Are there risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote to approve and adopt the merger agreement?
 

A: Yes. You should consider the risk factors set out in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 16 of this document.

Table of Contents

Q: What vote is required to approve and adopt the merger agreement?
 

A: Holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of First Interstate common stock must vote in favor of the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement. Each share of First Interstate Class A common stock has one vote on each matter
presented to shareholders and each share of First Interstate Class B common stock has five votes on each matter presented to

Q: What vote is required to approve the items other than the merger agreement?
 

A: For First Interstate shareholders: Approval of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of: (1) a majority of the voting power of First Interstate Class A and Class B common
stock, voting together as a single class; or (2) two-thirds of the voting power of First Interstate Class A common stock and First
Interstate Class B common stock present in person or represented by proxy, voting together as a single class. Additionally, the
approval of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate requires the vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock, each voting separately
as a class.

Each of the proposals to (1) adjourn the meeting, if necessary, to permit further solicitation of proxies, (2) elect the nominees for
directors, (3) approve the non-binding advisory resolution on executive compensation, (4) ratify RSM US LLP as the independent

of a majority of the votes cast, with First Interstate Class A common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock voting
together as a single class.

The non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation will be determined by a
plurality of the votes cast, meaning that the option with the greatest number of votes will be considered the recommendation of
the shareholders.

For Cascade shareholders: Each of the proposals to (1) approve the non-binding advisory vote on the compensation that will or
may become payable to the named executive officers of Cascade in connection with the merger, (2) approve, on a non-binding
advisory basis, the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate and (3) adjourn the meeting if necessary to

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the shareholder meetings?
 

A: Holders of shares of First Interstate common stock at the close of business on March 17, 2017 are entitled to vote at the First
Interstate annual meeting. As of the record date, 21,923,892 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock were outstanding and
entitled to vote and 23,217,418 shares of First Interstate Class B common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote.

meeting. As of the record date, 75,060,030 shares of Cascade common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote.

 
Q: If I plan to attend the shareholder meeting in person, should I still return my proxy?
 

A: Yes. Whether or not you plan to attend the shareholder meeting, you should promptly submit your proxy so that your shares will
be voted at the meeting. The failure of a shareholder to vote in person or by proxy will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the merger agreement and, for First Interstate shareholders, a vote “AGAINST” the amended and restated articles of
incorporation of First Interstate.

 
Q: What do I need to do now to vote my shares of common stock?
 

A: For First Interstate shareholders: If you are a “shareholder of record,” you can vote your shares as follows:
 

 •  via internet at http://www.voteproxy.com;
 

 •  via telephone by calling 1-800-PROXIES in the United States or 1-718-921-8500 in foreign countries;
 

 •  by completing and returning the proxy card that is enclosed; or
 

 •  by voting in person at the meeting.

Please refer to the specific instructions set forth on the proxy card. We encourage you to vote via the internet or by telephone.

For Cascade shareholders: If you are a “shareholder of record,” you can vote your shares as follows:
 

 •  via internet at http://www.proxyvote.com;
 

 •  via telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903;
 

 •  by completing and returning the proxy card that is enclosed; or
 

 •  by voting in person at the meeting.

Please refer to the specific instructions set forth on the proxy card. We encourage you to vote via the internet or by telephone.

 
Q: How do I change my vote after I have submitted my proxy?
 

A: You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the meeting by: (1) filing with the Corporate Secretary a duly
executed revocation of proxy; (2) submitting a new proxy card with a later date; (3) voting again via the internet or by telephone;
or (4) voting in person at the meeting (your attendance at the meeting will not by itself revoke your proxy).

 
Q: If my shares are held in “street name” by my broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other nominee

automatically vote my shares for me?
 

A: Your broker, bank or other nominee will not be able to vote your shares of common stock on the proposal to approve and adopt
the merger agreement or on certain other proposals unless you provide instructions on how to vote. However, for First Interstate
shareholders, your broker, bank or other nominee will be able to vote your shares of common stock on the proposal to ratify RSM
US LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm even if you do not provide instructions on how to vote. Please
instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares,

following the directions that your broker, bank or other nominee provides. If you do not provide instructions to your broker, bank
or other nominee, your shares will not be voted, and this will have the effect of voting “AGAINST” the merger agreement and a
vote “AGAINST” the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate. Please review the instructions from your
broker, bank or other nominee to see if your broker, bank or other nominee offers telephone or internet voting.

 
Q: What are the deadlines for voting?
 

A: You may: (1) vote by mail at any time before the meeting as long as your proxy is received before the time of the meeting; or
(2) vote by internet or telephone by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time on May 23, 2017.

If your shares are held in “street name,” you must vote your shares according to the voting instructions form by the deadline set
by your broker, bank or other nominee.

 
Q: As a First Interstate shareholder, why am I being asked to vote on the amended and restated articles of incorporation?
 

A: The changes to the articles of incorporation of First Interstate generally provide that the holders of First Interstate Class A
common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock will receive the same consideration in certain mergers and other
transactions unless the merger or other transaction is approved by holders of 70% of First Interstate Class A common stock,
voting as a separate class.

 
Q: What will happen if the First Interstate shareholders do not approve the amended and restated articles of incorporation of

First Interstate?
 

A: Approval of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate is a condition to completion of the merger.
Therefore, if the merger is approved by the shareholders but the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate
are not, we will not complete the merger unless the condition is waived by First Interstate and Cascade.

 
Q: As a Cascade shareholder, why am I being asked to cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation that will or

may become payable to Cascade’s named executive officers in connection with the merger?
 

A: The SEC adopted rules that require Cascade to seek a non-binding advisory vote with respect to certain “golden parachute”
compensation that will or may become payable to Cascade’s named executive officers in connection with the merger.

 
Q: What will happen if Cascade shareholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable to Cascade’s

named executive officers in connection with the merger?
 

A: The vote with respect to the “golden parachute” compensation is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Cascade or First
Interstate. Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable to Cascade’s named executive officers is not a
condition to completion of the merger. Therefore, if the merger agreement is approved by Cascade’s shareholders and the merger
is subsequently completed, the compensation will still be paid to Cascade’s named executive officers, whether or not Cascade
shareholders approve the compensation at the meeting.

 
Q: As a Cascade shareholder, why am I being asked to vote on a non-binding advisory basis to approve the amended and restated

articles of incorporation of First Interstate?
 

A: Although a separate vote on this proposal by Cascade’s shareholders is not required to effectuate the merger under applicable
Oregon law, nor is it required by the merger agreement to complete the merger, Cascade

shareholders are being given the opportunity to express their views on certain material amendments to an acquiror’s
organizational documents, which in this case includes whether to approve the amended and restated articles of incorporation of
First Interstate. However, the vote by Cascade shareholders to approve the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First
Interstate is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Cascade or First Interstate. Therefore, if the merger agreement is
approved by Cascade’s shareholders and the merger is subsequently completed, the amended and restated articles of incorporation
will be amended at the completion of the merger.

 
Q: What are the tax consequences of the merger to me?
 

A: It is a condition to the completion of the merger that First Interstate and Cascade receive written opinions from their respective
counsel to the effect that the merger will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to in this document as the “Internal Revenue Code.” Subject to the
limitations and qualifications described in the section entitled “Description of the Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequence of the Merger,” if you are a United States holder of Cascade common stock, you will recognize gain (but not loss) in
an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount by which the sum of the fair market value of the First Interstate Class A common
stock and cash you receive exceeds your tax basis in your Cascade common stock and (2) the amount of cash you receive (in each
case excluding any cash received instead of fractional shares of Cascade common stock).

You should read “Description of the Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequence of the Merger” beginning on page
91 of this document for more information about the United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. Tax matters can
be complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation. You should consult
your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the merger to you.

As of the record date, there were 75,060,030 shares of Cascade common stock outstanding. The directors and executive
officers of Cascade, and their affiliates, as a group, beneficially owned 30,168,784 shares of Cascade common stock, representing
40.2% of the outstanding shares of Cascade common stock as of the record date. All of the directors and certain shareholders of

Cascade common stock as of the record date, have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger agreement at the special
meeting.

The Merger and the Merger Agreement (page 55)

First Interstate’s acquisition of Cascade is governed by a merger agreement. The merger agreement provides that, if all of the
conditions to the completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, Cascade will be merged with and into First Interstate, with First
Interstate as the surviving entity. Immediately following the merger, Cascade Bank will merge with and into First Interstate Bank,
with First Interstate Bank as the surviving entity. We encourage you to read the merger agreement, which is included as
Annex A to this document.

What Cascade Shareholders Will Receive in the Merger (page 55)

Upon completion of the merger, each share of Cascade common stock outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the
merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.14864 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and $1.91 in cash,
without interest. Immediately following completion of the merger, Cascade shareholders will own approximately 34.1% of the
outstanding shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and 20.0% of the aggregate outstanding shares of First Interstate
common stock, which equates to 7.6% of the voting power of First Interstate common stock.

Comparative Market Prices (page 29)

The following table shows the closing price per share of First Interstate Class A common stock, the closing price per share of
Cascade common stock and the equivalent price per share of Cascade common stock, giving effect to the merger, on November 17,
2016, which is the last day on which shares of each of First Interstate Class A common stock and Cascade common stock traded
preceding the public announcement of the proposed merger, and on April 5, 2017, the most recent practicable date before the
mailing of this document. The implied value of one share of Cascade common stock is computed by multiplying the price of a
share of First Interstate Class A common stock by the 0.14864 exchange ratio and adding the $1.91 in cash to be received by a
Cascade shareholder.

Treatment of Cascade Equity Awards (page 90)

At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase shares of Cascade common stock outstanding immediately before
the effective time of the merger, whether or not vested, will be cancelled and, upon First Interstate’s receipt of an option surrender
agreement from the holder, exchanged for a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Cascade common
stock subject to the stock option multiplied by (2) the amount by which the merger consideration exceeds the exercise price of such
option, less applicable withholding taxes. For purposes of this calculation, the merger consideration is the sum of the cash
consideration and the product of the exchange ratio times the average closing sales price of First Interstate Class A common stock

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of restricted stock will vest and be converted into the right to
receive 0.14864 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and $1.91 in cash, without interest.

At the effective time of the merger, each Cascade restricted stock unit outstanding immediately before the effective time of
the merger, whether or not vested, will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of
shares of Cascade common stock subject to the restricted stock unit multiplied by (2) the merger consideration, less applicable
withholding taxes. For purposes of this calculation, the merger consideration is the sum of the cash consideration and the product
of the exchange ratio times the average closing sales price of First Interstate Class A common stock over the 20 consecutive trading
days ending on the fifth day before the closing date of the merger.

If the price of First Interstate Class A common stock used in determining the payments to Cascade’s equity holders was
$38.50, which was the closing price of First Interstate Class A common stock on April 5, 2017, the most recent practicable trading
before the date of this document, the aggregate payments made to holders of outstanding Cascade stock options and Cascade
restricted stock units would be approximately $9.5 million and $437,138, respectively.

Recommendation of First Interstate Board of Directors (page 79)

First Interstate’s board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement. First Interstate’s board of directors
believes that the merger agreement, including the bank merger agreement under which Cascade Bank will merge with and into
First Interstate Bank, is fair to, and in the best interests of, First Interstate and its shareholders, and therefore unanimously
recommends that First Interstate shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. In
reaching this decision, First Interstate’s board of directors considered many factors, including the factors described in the section
entitled “Description of the Merger—First Interstate’s Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 77.

Opinion of First Interstate’s Financial Advisor (page 79)

First Interstate engaged Barclays Capital Inc., which we refer to in this document as “Barclays,” to act as its financial advisor
with respect to a possible purchase of Cascade, pursuant to an engagement letter dated October 13, 2016. In deciding to approve
the proposed merger, First Interstate’s board of directors considered the oral opinion of Barclays, confirmed by delivery of a
written opinion, dated November 16, 2016, to First Interstate’s board of directors to the effect that, as of such date and based upon
and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by First
Interstate in the proposed merger was fair to First Interstate, from a financial point of view.

The full text of Barclays’ written opinion, dated as of November 16, 2016, is attached as Annex B to this document.
Barclays’ written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered
and limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion. You are encouraged to read the opinion
carefully in its entirety.

Recommendation of Cascade Board of Directors (page 66)

Cascade’s board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement. Cascade’s board of directors believes that the
merger agreement, including the bank merger agreement pursuant to which Cascade Bank will merge with and into First Interstate
Bank, is fair to, and in the best interests of, Cascade and its shareholders, and therefore unanimously recommends that Cascade
shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement. In its reaching this decision, Cascade’s
board of directors considered many factors, including the factors described in the section entitled “Description of the Merger—
Background of and Cascade’s Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 55.

Opinion of Cascade’s Financial Advisor (page 66)

In deciding to approve the merger agreement, Cascade’s board of directors considered the opinion of Piper Jaffray and Co.,
which we refer to in this document as “Piper Jaffray.” Piper Jaffray, which served as Cascade’s financial advisor, delivered its
opinion dated November 16, 2016 that the merger consideration is fair to the holders of Cascade common stock from a financial
point of view.

The full text of Piper Jaffray’s written opinion, dated as of November 16, 2016, is attached as Annex C to this
document. Piper Jaffray’s written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed,
factors considered and limitations upon the review undertaken by Piper Jaffray in rendering its opinion. You are
encouraged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety.

No Appraisal Rights for Cascade Shareholders

Because Cascade is an Oregon corporation and Cascade common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, a national
securities exchange, under Oregon law, Cascade shareholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger
with respect to their shares of Cascade common stock.

Regulatory Approvals (page 94)

Under the terms of the merger agreement, the bank merger cannot be completed unless it is first approved by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which we refer to in this document as the “Federal Reserve Board,” the Montana
Division of Banking and Financial Institutions, which we refer to in this document as the “Montana Division,” and the Director of
the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services acting by and through the Administration of the Division of Financial
Regulation, which we refer to in this document as the “Oregon Division.” First Interstate must also receive the prior approval of, or
waiver from, the Federal Reserve Board for the merger. First Interstate has received approvals from the Federal Reserve Board, the
Montana Division and the Oregon Division.

Conditions to Completing the Merger (page 101)

The completion of the merger is subject to the fulfillment of a number of conditions, including:
 

 •  approval and adoption of the merger agreement by the shareholders of First Interstate and of Cascade;
 

 •  approval of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate by First Interstate shareholders;
 

 
•  filing by First Interstate of a form with Nasdaq for the listing of shares of First Interstate Class A common stock to be

issued in the merger and Nasdaq has authorized and not objected to the listing of such shares of First Interstate Class A
common stock;

 

 •  approval of the merger and bank merger by the appropriate regulatory authorities;
 

 
•  receipt by each party of an opinion from its legal counsel to the effect that the merger will be treated for federal income

tax purposes as a reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code;
 

 
•  the accuracy of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement, subject to certain materiality or material

adverse effect qualifications described in the merger agreement; and
 

 •  the performance in all material respects of their respective obligations under the merger agreement.

Termination (page 109)

The merger agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of First Interstate and Cascade at any time before the
completion of the merger. Additionally, subject to conditions and circumstances described in the merger agreement, either First
Interstate or Cascade may terminate the merger agreement if, among other things, any of the following occur:
 

 •  a required regulatory approval is denied or a governmental authority permanently enjoins or prohibits the merger;
 

 
•  the merger has not been completed by November 17, 2017; provided, that if all the conditions to completing the merger

have been satisfied by November 17, 2017 except for the receipt of required regulatory approvals, either First Interstate
or Cascade may extend the termination date under this provision by six months;

 

 

•  by either party, if the other party breaches a covenant or agreement or if any representation or warranty of the other party
has become untrue (subject to the materiality standard contained in the merger agreement) and such breach or untrue
representation or warranty has not been or cannot be cured within 30 days following written notice to the party in
default; or

 

 
•  First Interstate shareholders or Cascade shareholders do not approve and adopt the merger agreement or First Interstate

shareholders do not approve the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate.

First Interstate may terminate the merger agreement if Cascade breaches its agreements in any material respect regarding the
solicitation of other acquisition proposals and the submission of the merger agreement to shareholders, or if Cascade’s board of
directors does not recommend approval and adoption of the merger agreement in this document or withdraws or revises its
recommendation in a manner adverse to First Interstate.

Cascade may terminate the merger agreement if First Interstate breaches its agreements in any material respect regarding the
submission of the merger agreement to First Interstate’s shareholders, or if First Interstate’s board of directors does not recommend
approval and adoption of the merger agreement in this document or withdraws or revises its recommendation to First Interstate’s
shareholders in a manner adverse to Cascade.

Cascade may terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal to be acquired by
a third party but only if the failure to enter into such third party acquisition proposal would be more likely than not to result in a
violation of the Cascade’s board of directors’ fiduciary duties and subject to other conditions described in the merger agreement.
Before this termination right can be exercised, First Interstate would have the right to propose an amendment or modification to the
merger agreement.

Termination Fee (page 110)

Cascade will be required to pay First Interstate a termination fee of $22.1 million if, among other things, Cascade terminates
the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal; First Interstate terminates the merger agreement if Cascade breaches in any
material respect its agreements regarding the solicitation of other acquisition proposals and the submission of the merger agreement
to shareholders; or if First Interstate terminates the merger agreement because Cascade’s board of directors does not recommend
approval of the merger agreement in this document or withdraws or revises its recommendation in a manner adverse to First
Interstate. First Interstate will pay the same termination fee to Cascade if Cascade terminates the merger agreement because First
Interstate breaches in any material respect its agreements regarding the submission of the merger agreement to shareholders or if
First Interstate’s board of directors does not recommend approval of the merger agreement in this document or withdraws or
revises its recommendation to First Interstate’s shareholders in a manner adverse to Cascade.

Interests of Cascade’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 95)

In considering the information contained in this document, you should be aware that Cascade’s directors and executive
officers have financial interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Cascade shareholders
generally. These interests include, among other things:
 

 

•  employment agreements between Cascade and each of Terry E. Zink, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cascade,
Charles N. Reeves, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Cascade, Gregory D. Newton, Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Cascade, Daniel J. Lee, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer
of Cascade and Peggy Biss, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of Cascade, that each provide for
cash severance payments and continued life insurance and non-taxable medical and dental benefits if the executive’s
employment is voluntarily terminated for good reason or involuntarily terminated without cause within 12 months before
or 18 months following a change in control;

 

 
•  First Interstate’s interest in retaining Charles N. Reeves, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of

Cascade, as First Interstate’s Chief Banking Officer—West pursuant to which Mr. Reeves and First Interstate may enter
into new compensatory arrangements;

 

 •  the termination, accelerated vesting and payment of all outstanding Cascade stock options;
 

 •  the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding Cascade restricted stock awards;
 

 •  the termination of and payment for all outstanding Cascade restricted stock units, whether or not vested;
 

 
•  the appointment of two directors who are current directors of Cascade to First Interstate’s board of directors immediately

following the merger; and
 

 
•  the rights of Cascade officers and directors under the merger agreement to continued indemnification coverage and

continued coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies.

Board of Directors (page 133)

Immediately after the completion of the merger, First Interstate’s board of directors will consist of all the current directors of
First Interstate and two current directors of Cascade.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger (page 91)

The merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

Certain Differences in Shareholder Rights (page 125)

When the merger is completed, Cascade shareholders will become First Interstate shareholders and their rights will be
governed by Montana law and by First Interstate’s articles of incorporation (as amended and restated) and bylaws.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequence of the Merger (page 91)

It is a condition to the completion of the merger that First Interstate and Cascade receive written opinions from their
respective counsel to the effect that the merger will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Subject to the limitations and qualifications described in the section entitled “Description of the Merger—

Merger,” if you are a United States holder of Cascade common stock, you will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to
the lesser of (1) the amount by which the sum of the fair market value of the First Interstate Class A common stock and cash you
receive exceeds your tax basis in your Cascade common stock, and (2) the amount of cash you receive (in each case excluding any
cash received instead of fractional shares of Cascade common stock).

Gain that you recognize in connection with the merger generally will constitute capital gain, except that depending on certain
facts specific to you, any gain recognized could instead be taxable as a dividend.

This tax treatment may not apply to all Cascade shareholders. Determining the actual tax consequences of the merger
to Cascade shareholders can be complicated. Cascade shareholders should consult their own tax advisor for a full
understanding of the merger’s tax consequences that are particular to each shareholder.

Litigation Relating to the Merger (page 111)

Following the announcement on November 17, 2016 of the execution of the merger agreement, three shareholders of Cascade
filed putative class action lawsuits against Cascade, its directors, and First Interstate challenging the proposed transaction. Two of
the complaints allege that the directors of Cascade breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their approval of the merger
agreement and that First Interstate aided and abetted those alleged fiduciary breaches. The third complaint alleges that Cascade, its
directors, and First Interstate violated provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose material information about the
proposed transaction. Other potential plaintiffs may also file additional lawsuits challenging the proposed transaction. If the cases
are not resolved, these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the merger and result in substantial costs to First Interstate
and Cascade, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers. The defense or settlement of any
lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed may adversely affect First Interstate’s business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

RISK FACTORS

In deciding how to vote, you should consider carefully all of the information included in this document and its annexes and all of
the information incorporated by reference and the risk factors identified by First Interstate and Cascade with respect to their
operations included in their filings with the SEC, including in each case the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016. See “Where You Can Find More Information.” In addition, you should consider the following risk factors.

Because the market price of First Interstate Class A common stock will fluctuate and the exchange ratio will not be adjusted
for such changes, Cascade shareholders cannot be sure of the market value of the merger consideration they will receive.

Upon the completion of the merger, each share of Cascade common stock outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the
merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.14864 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and $1.91 in cash, without
interest. The exchange ratio is fixed in the merger agreement and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either First
Interstate Class A common stock or Cascade common stock. The market value of the merger consideration may vary from the closing
price of First Interstate Class A common stock on the date we announced the execution of the merger agreement, on the date that this
document was mailed to Cascade shareholders and First Interstate shareholders, on the date of the special meeting of the Cascade
shareholders or the annual meeting of the First Interstate shareholders and on the date we complete the merger. Therefore, at the time of
the special meeting, Cascade shareholders will not know or be able to calculate the market value of the First Interstate Class A common
stock they will receive upon completion of the merger. For example, based on the range of closing prices of First Interstate Class A
common stock during the period from November 17, 2016, the last trading day before public announcement of the merger, through
April 5, 2017, the last practicable date before the date of this document, the merger consideration represented a market value ranging
from a low of $7.22 to a high of $8.65 for each share of Cascade common stock.

Neither First Interstate nor Cascade are permitted to terminate the merger agreement or resolicit the vote of their respective
shareholders solely because of changes in the market price of their common stock. Stock price changes may result from a variety of
factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in our respective businesses, operations and prospects, and
regulatory considerations.

First Interstate may be unable to successfully integrate Cascade’s operations or retain Cascade’s employees, which could
adversely affect the combined company.

The merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently. The difficulties of combining
the operations of the two companies include, among other things: integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds; combining
different corporate cultures; and retaining key employees.

The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of the business and the
loss of key personnel. The integration of the two companies will substantially benefit from the experience and expertise of certain key
employees of Cascade who are expected to be retained by First Interstate. First Interstate may not be successful in retaining these
employees for the time period necessary to successfully integrate Cascade’s operations with those of First Interstate. The diversion of
management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two
companies’ operations could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of First Interstate following the merger.

Additionally, First Interstate may not be able to successfully achieve the level of cost savings, revenue enhancements and other
synergies that it expects, and may not be able to capitalize upon the existing customer relationships of Cascade to the extent
anticipated, or it may take longer, or be more difficult or expensive than expected, to achieve these goals. This could have an adverse
effect on First Interstate’s business, results of operation and stock price.

Implementation of the various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act—in particular provisions that are applicable to banks and
bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in assets—may delay the receipt of regulatory approvals for the merger or
increase the combined company’s operating costs or otherwise have a material effect on the combined company’s business,
financial condition or results of operations after the merger.

The Dodd—Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which we refer to in this document as the “Dodd-Frank
Act,” resulted in several requirements for new banking regulations with $10 billion or more in assets. As a result of the merger, the
combined company is expected to surpass this threshold, and these provisions, subject to a phase-in period, may significantly increase
compliance or operating costs of the combined company or otherwise have a significant impact on the business, financial condition and
results of operations of the combined company. Such provisions include:
 

 

•  The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which we refer to in this document as the “CFPB,”
which has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for
a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or
abusive” acts and practices. Currently, the Federal Reserve Board and the Montana Division examine First Interstate Bank
for compliance with consumer protection laws. However, the CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all
banks with more than $10 billion in assets, and accordingly will assume examination and enforcement authority over the
combined company following the merger.

 

 
•  The Dodd-Frank Act has limited the interchange fees for electronic debt transactions by a payment card issuer to $0.21 plus

five basis points times the value of the transaction, plus up to $0.01 for fraud prevention costs. Following the merger, this
will lower significantly our interchange or “swipe” revenue.

 

 

•  The Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% as the minimum Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio and has adopted a plan under
which it will meet the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio of 1.35% by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires
the FDIC to offset the effect of the increase in the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory
minimum of 1.15% on institutions with assets less than $10 billion. Following the merger, we will not be entitled to benefit
from the offset.

 

 
•  The Dodd-Frank Act requires a publicly traded bank holding company with $10 billion or more in assets to establish and

maintain a risk committee responsible for oversight of enterprise-wide risk management practices, which must be
commensurate with the bank’s structure, risk profile, complexity, activities and size.

 

 

•  A bank holding company with more than $10 billion in assets is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to conduct annual stress
tests to determine whether the capital planning of the combined company, assessment of its capital adequacy and risk
management practices adequately protect it and its affiliates in the event of an economic downturn. The combined company
will be required to report the results of its annual stress tests to the Federal Reserve Board, and it will be required to consider
the results of the combined company’s stress tests as part of its capital planning and risk management practices. Assuming
the merger is consummated in the third quarter of 2017, the combined company is anticipated to be subject to the DFAST
regime commencing on January 1, 2019, but well in advance of that date, the combined company will need to undertake the
planning and other actions that it deems reasonably necessary to achieve timely compliance.

It is difficult to predict the overall compliance cost of these provisions, which will become effective (with a phase-in period) when
the combined company surpasses $10 billion in consolidated assets as a result of the merger. However, compliance with these
provisions will likely require additional staffing, engagement of external consultants and other operating costs that could have a
material adverse effect on the future financial condition and results of operations of the combined company.

The success of the merger and integration of First Interstate and Cascade will depend on a number of uncertain factors that
could materially and adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the combined company or prevent the
combined company from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger.

The success of the merger and the ability to realize the its anticipated benefits will depend on a number of factors, including:
 

 •  First Interstate’s ability to integrate the branches acquired from Cascade Bank in the merger into its current operations;
 

 
•  First Interstate’s ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by its new customers in the acquired branches and to

successfully retain and manage interest-earning assets acquired in the merger;
 

 
•  First Interstate’s ability to control the incremental non-interest expense from the acquired branches in a manner that enables

it to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;
 

 •  First Interstate’s ability to retain and attract the appropriate personnel to staff the acquired branches; and
 

 
•  First Interstate’s ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and non-interest income, including fee income, from the

acquired branches.

Integrating the acquired branches will be an operation of substantial size and expense, and may be affected by general market and
economic conditions or government actions affecting the financial industry generally. Integration efforts will also likely divert First
Interstate’s management’s attention and resources. First Interstate may not be able to integrate the acquired branches successfully, and
the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, or inconsistencies in standards,
controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect First Interstate’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers,
depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. First Interstate may also encounter unexpected
difficulties or costs during the integration that could adversely affect its earnings and financial condition, perhaps materially.
Additionally, the operation of the acquired branches may adversely affect First Interstate’s existing profitability, First Interstate may not
be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by its existing banking business or First Interstate may not be able to
manage any growth resulting from the merger effectively.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements included in this document are preliminary and the actual
financial condition and results of operations of First Interstate after the merger may differ materially.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements in this document are presented for illustrative purposes only
and are not necessarily indicative of what First Interstate’s actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the
merger been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial data, while helpful in
illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions, does not reflect the benefits of
expected cost savings or opportunities to earn additional revenue and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements reflect adjustments, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to
record the Cascade identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase
price allocation reflected in this document is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be based on the actual purchase
price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Cascade as of the date of the completion of the merger. Accordingly, the final
acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this document. For more

Cascade and First Interstate will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Cascade or First Interstate.
These uncertainties may impair Cascade’s or First Interstate’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is
completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with Cascade or First Interstate to seek to change existing business
relationships with Cascade or First Interstate. Retention of certain employees by Cascade or First Interstate may be challenging while
the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key
employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, or a desire not to remain with Cascade or
First Interstate, Cascade’s business or First Interstate’s business could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, Cascade
has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to closing. See “Description of the Merger Agreement—Conduct of
Business Before the Merger” for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to Cascade and First Interstate.

The termination fee and the restrictions on solicitation contained in the merger agreement may discourage other companies
from trying to acquire Cascade.

Until the completion of the merger, with certain exceptions, Cascade is prohibited from initiating, soliciting, knowingly
encouraging or taking other actions to facilitate any inquiries, discussions or the making of any proposals that may lead to an
acquisition proposal, such as a merger or other business combination transaction, with any person other than First Interstate. In
addition, Cascade has agreed to pay a termination fee to First Interstate if the merger agreement is terminated in specified
circumstances, including if Cascade terminates the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal with another person. These
provisions could discourage other companies from trying to acquire Cascade even though those other companies might be willing to
offer greater value to Cascade’s shareholders than First Interstate has offered in the merger. See “Description of the Merger—
Termination of the Merger Agreement” and “—Termination Fee” for more information about the termination fee and Cascade’s
restrictions on solicitation.

Certain of Cascade’s officers and directors have interests that are different from, or in addition to, interests of Cascade’s
shareholders generally.

The directors and certain officers of Cascade have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of
Cascade shareholders generally. These include: (1) employment and change in control agreements for certain officers of Cascade and
Cascade Bank that provide for cash severance payments and continued health insurance benefits upon completion of the merger; (2) a
cash payment in connection with the termination of all outstanding Cascade stock options; (3) the acceleration of vesting of all
outstanding restricted stock awards; (4) a cash payment in connection with the termination of all outstanding Cascade restricted stock
units; (5) the appointment of two directors of Cascade to the board of directors of First Interstate immediately following the merger;
and (6) provisions in the merger agreement relating to indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers and
insurance for directors and officers of Cascade for events occurring before the merger.

For a more detailed discussion of these interests, see “Description of the Merger—Interests of Cascade’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 95.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock prices and future businesses and financial results of First
Interstate and Cascade.

There can be no assurance that the merger will be completed. If the merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of First
Interstate and Cascade may be adversely affected and First Interstate and Cascade will be subject to a number of risks, including the
following:
 

 
•  First Interstate and Cascade will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is

completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, proxy solicitation and printing fees;
 

 
•  under the merger agreement, Cascade and First Interstate are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their respective

businesses before completing the merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies if
the merger is terminated; and

 

 
•  matters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by First Interstate and Cascade

management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to First
Interstate and Cascade as independent companies, as the case may be.

In addition, if the merger is not completed, First Interstate and/or Cascade may experience negative reactions from the financial
markets and from their respective customers and employees. First Interstate and/or Cascade also could be subject to litigation related to
any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced by First Interstate or Cascade against the other seeking damages or to
compel the other to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. These factors and similar risks could have an adverse effect on
the results of operation, business and stock prices of First Interstate and Cascade.

Both First Interstate and Cascade shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will
exercise less influence over management of the combined organization.

Each of First Interstate and Cascade shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of their respective board of
directors and on various other matters affecting their respective company. Upon the completion of the merger, Cascade’s shareholders
will become shareholders of First Interstate with a percentage ownership of the combined organization that is substantially smaller than
such shareholders’ percentage ownership of Cascade. Further, because shares of First Interstate Class A common stock will be issued to
existing Cascade shareholders, the shareholders of First Interstate Class A common stock will have their ownership interests diluted by
approximately 9.7% and voting interests diluted by approximately 1.2% and the shareholders of First Interstate Class B common stock
will have their ownership interests diluted by approximately 10.4% and voting interests diluted by approximately 6.4%.

The reduced voting power of Cascade shareholders is further exacerbated due to the two classes of common stock that First
Interstate maintains. First Interstate Class B common stock is entitled to five votes per share, while shares of First Interstate Class A
common stock, which is what will be issued to Cascade shareholders, are entitled to one vote per share. As of March 17, 2017,
members of the Scott family held 16,469,421 shares of First Interstate Class B common stock and, therefore, controlled in excess of
59.8% of the voting power of First Interstate’s outstanding common stock. As a result, the Scott family will be able to exert a
significant degree of influence or actual control over First Interstate’s management and affairs and over matters requiring shareholder
approval, including the election of directors, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of First Interstate’s assets and any
other significant transaction. This concentrated control will limit Cascade shareholders’ future ability to influence corporate matters,
and the interests of the Scott family may not always coincide with First Interstate’s interests or your interests.

The fairness opinions obtained by each of First Interstate and Cascade from their respective financial advisors will not reflect
changes in circumstances after the date of such fairness opinions.

Barclays, First Interstate’s financial advisor in connection with the merger, has delivered to the board of directors of First
Interstate its opinion dated as of November 16, 2016. Piper Jaffray, Cascade’s financial advisor in connection with the merger, has
delivered to the board of directors of Cascade its opinion dated as of November 16, 2016. The opinions of the respective financial
advisors state that as of the respective date of each opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein,
the merger consideration to be paid to the holders of the outstanding shares of Cascade common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair from a financial point of view to First Interstate and Cascade shareholders, respectively. The opinions do not reflect
changes that may occur or may have occurred after the date of such opinions, including changes to the operations and prospects of First
Interstate or Cascade, changes in general market and economic conditions or regulatory or other factors. Any such changes, or changes
in other factors on which each opinion is based, may materially alter or affect the estimated valuation conclusions reached in such
opinions for First Interstate and Cascade.

Cascade shareholders do not have appraisal rights in the merger.

Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable shareholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction,
such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding
instead of receiving the merger consideration offered to shareholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under Oregon
law, shareholders do not have appraisal rights with respect to shares of any class of stock that were listed on a national securities
exchange. Because Cascade is an Oregon corporation and Cascade common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, a national
securities exchange, holders of shares of Cascade common stock will not be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger
with respect to their shares of Cascade common stock.

The shares of First Interstate common stock to be received by Cascade shareholders as a result of the merger will have
different rights from the shares of Cascade common stock.

Upon completion of the merger, Cascade shareholders will become First Interstate shareholders. Their rights as shareholders will
be governed by Montana corporate law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of First Interstate. The rights associated with
Cascade common stock are governed by Oregon corporate law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Cascade and are
different from the rights associated with First Interstate common stock. See the section of this document entitled “Comparison of
Rights of Shareholders” beginning on page 125 for a discussion of the different rights associated with First Interstate common stock.

Pending litigation against First Interstate and Cascade could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the merger or
a judgment resulting in the payment of damages.

Following the announcement on November 17, 2016 of the execution of the merger agreement, three shareholders of Cascade
filed putative class action lawsuits against Cascade, its directors, and First Interstate challenging the proposed transaction. The outcome
of any such litigation is uncertain. If the cases are not resolved, these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the merger and
result in substantial costs to First Interstate and Cascade, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors and
officers. One of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no order, injunction or decree or other legal restraint or prohibition
that prevents consummating the merger, the bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be
in effect. As such, if plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the completion of the merger on the agreed-upon
terms, then such injunction may prevent the merger from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe.
The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is completed may adversely affect
First Interstate’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For more information, see “Description of the
Merger—Litigation Related to the Merger.”

SUMMARY SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED DATA

The following tables show selected unaudited financial information on a pro forma combined basis giving effect to the merger as
if the merger had become effective at the end of the period presented, in the case of balance sheet information, and at the beginning of
2016, in the case of income statement information. The selected unaudited pro forma information reflects the acquisition method of
accounting.

First Interstate anticipates that the combined company will derive financial benefits that include reduced operating expenses and
the opportunity to earn more revenue. The selected unaudited pro forma information, while helpful in illustrating the financial
characteristics of First Interstate following the merger under one set of assumptions, does not reflect all of these benefits and,
accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. The selected unaudited pro forma information also does not
necessarily reflect what the historical results of First Interstate would have been had First Interstate and Cascade been combined during
this period.

An exchange ratio of 0.14864 was used in preparing this selected pro forma information. You should read this selected summary
pro forma information in conjunction with the information under “Pro Forma Financial Information” and with the historical
information incorporated by reference into this document on which it is based.

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

The following table shows information about First Interstate’s and Cascade’s earnings per common share, dividends per share and
book value per share, and similar information giving effect to the merger (which we refer to as “pro forma” information). In presenting
the unaudited comparative pro forma information for the time periods shown, we assumed that First Interstate and Cascade had been
merged on the date indicated or at the beginning of 2016.

The information listed as “pro forma combined” was prepared using an exchange ratio of 0.14864. The information listed as “per
equivalent Cascade share” was obtained by multiplying the pro forma amounts by an exchange ratio of 0.14864. First Interstate
anticipates that the combined company will derive financial benefits from the merger that include reduced operating expenses and the
opportunity to earn more revenue. The unaudited pro forma combined information, while helpful in illustrating the financial
characteristics of First Interstate following the merger under one set of assumptions, does not reflect these benefits and, accordingly,
does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. The unaudited pro forma combined information also does not necessarily reflect
what the historical results of First Interstate would have been had our companies been combined during this period.

The information in the following table is based on, and should be read together with, the historical financial information that we
have presented in or incorporated by reference in this document.

This document is being provided to holders of First Interstate common stock as First Interstate’s proxy statement in connection

 •  Approve the amended and restated bylaws of First Interstate.
 

 
•  Transact any other business that may properly come before the annual meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the

annual meeting.

Who Can Vote at the Meeting

You are entitled to vote if the records of First Interstate showed that you held shares of First Interstate common stock as of the
close of business on March 17, 2017, which is the record date for the First Interstate annual meeting. As of the close of business on the
record date, 21,923,892 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and 23,217,418 shares of First Interstate Class B common
stock were outstanding. Each share of First Interstate Class A common stock has one vote on each matter presented to shareholders and
each share of First Interstate Class B common stock has five votes on each matter presented to shareholders. If your shares are held in
“street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote in person at the annual meeting, you will have to obtain a
“legal proxy” from your broker, bank or other nominee entitling you to vote at the annual meeting.

Table of Contents

Quorum; Vote Required

The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of First Interstate common stock at the
annual meeting constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the annual meeting. If you submit valid proxy instructions or
attend the meeting in person, your shares will be counted to determine whether there is a quorum, even if you abstain from voting. If
you fail to provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee with respect to a proposal, that broker, bank or other
nominee will not vote your shares of First Interstate common stock with respect to that proposal.

Approval and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the voting power of First Interstate
Class A and Class B common stock entitled to vote at the meeting, voting as a single class. Failure to submit valid proxy
instructions or to vote in person will have the same effect as a vote against the merger agreement. Broker non-votes and
abstentions from voting will have the same effect as voting against the merger agreement.

Approval of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate requires the affirmative vote of the holders of the
greater of: (1) a majority of the voting power of First Interstate Class A and Class B common stock, voting as a single class; or
(2) two-thirds of the voting power of First Interstate Class A and Class B common stock present in person or represented by proxy at
the annual meeting, voting as a single class. Additionally, the approval of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First
Interstate requires the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the First Interstate Class A common stock and First
Interstate Class B common stock, each voting separately as a class. Failure to submit valid proxy instructions or to vote in person
will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions from voting will have the same effect
as voting against this proposal.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of First Interstate Class A and Class B common stock cast at the annual meeting,
voting together as a single class, is required to (1) adjourn the meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies, (2) elect the
nominees for directors, (3) approve the non-binding advisory resolution on executive compensation, (4) ratify RSM US LLP as the
independent registered public accounting firm and (5) approve the amended and restated bylaws of First Interstate. An abstention from
voting will have no effect on these proposals. The failure to submit valid proxy instructions or to vote in person and broker non-votes
(which only will occur in the case of the vote on the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm) will have no
effect on the voting of these proposals.

The non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation will be determined by a
plurality of the votes cast, meaning that the option with the greatest number of votes will be considered the recommendation of the
shareholders. The failure to submit valid proxy instructions or to vote in person and broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting
of this proposal.

Shares Held by First Interstate Officers and Directors and by Cascade

As of March 17, 2017, directors and executive officers of First Interstate beneficially owned 12,013,715 shares of First Interstate
Class A common stock and 11,454,599 shares of First Interstate Class B common stock. This equals 41.9% of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of First Interstate common stock as of March 17, 2017. All of First Interstate’s directors entered into voting
agreements with Cascade to vote the 491,907 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and 11,454,599 shares of First Interstate
Class B common stock owned by them in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and the proposal to approve
the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate. As of March 17, 2017, neither Cascade nor any its subsidiaries,
directors or executive officers owned any shares of First Interstate common stock.

Voting and Revocability of Proxies

You may vote in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. To ensure your representation at the annual meeting, First Interstate
recommends that you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the annual meeting. You can always change your vote in person at the
annual meeting.

If you are a “shareholder of record,” you can vote your shares:
 

 •  via internet at http://www.voteproxy.com;
 

 •  via telephone by calling 1-800-PROXIES in the United States or 1-718-921-8500 in foreign countries;
 

 •  by completing and mailing the proxy card that is enclosed; or
 

 •  by voting in person at the annual meeting.

Please refer to the specific instructions set forth on the proxy card. We encourage you to vote via the internet or by telephone.

First Interstate shareholders whose shares are held in “street name” by their broker, bank or other nominee must follow the
instructions provided by their broker, bank or other nominee to vote their shares. Your broker, bank or other nominee may allow you to
deliver your voting instructions via telephone or the internet. If your shares are held in “street name” and you wish to vote in person at
the annual meeting, you will have to obtain a “legal proxy” from your broker, bank or other nominee entitling you to vote at the annual
meeting.

If you are a shareholder of record of First Interstate common stock, voting instructions are included on the enclosed proxy card. If
you properly complete and timely submit your proxy, your shares will be voted as you have directed. You may vote for, against or
abstain with respect to each matter. If you are the shareholder of record of your shares of First Interstate common stock and submit
your proxy without specifying a voting instruction, your shares of First Interstate common stock will be voted “FOR” the proposal to
approve and adopt the merger agreement, “FOR” the approval of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate,
“FOR” the proposal to adjourn the meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies, “FOR” each of the nominees for
director, “FOR” the non-binding advisory resolution on executive compensation, for “TWO YEARS” for the frequency of future
advisory votes regarding executive compensation, “FOR” ratifying RSM US LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm
and “FOR” the proposal to approve the amended and restated bylaws of First Interstate. If your shares are held in street name and you
return an incomplete instruction card to your broker, bank or other nominee, that broker, bank or other nominee will not vote your
shares with respect to any matter, except for the proposal to ratify the independent public accounting firm.

You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the annual meeting by:
 

 •  filing with the Corporate Secretary of First Interstate a duly executed revocation of proxy;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy with a later date;
 

 •  voting again via the internet or by telephone not later than 11:59 pm, Eastern Time, on May 23, 2017; or
 

 •  voting in person at the annual meeting.

If your shares are held in “street name,” you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.

Attendance at the annual meeting will not, in and of itself, constitute a revocation of a proxy. All written notices of revocation and
other communication with respect to the revocation of proxies should be addressed to:

First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.
Kirk D. Jensen, Corporate Secretary

401 North 31st Street
Billings, Montana 59116

If any matters not described in this document are properly presented at the First Interstate annual meeting, the persons named in
the proxy card will use their judgment to determine how to vote your shares of First Interstate common stock. First Interstate does not
know of any other matters to be presented at the annual meeting.

Participants in the 401(k) Plan

If you invest in First Interstate Class A common stock through the stock fund in the First Interstate Bank Savings and Profit
Sharing Plan for Employees, which we refer to in this document as the “401(k) Plan,” you will receive a voting instruction card for the
plan that will reflect all the shares that you may direct the trustee to vote on your behalf under the 401(k) Plan. Under the terms of the
401(k) Plan, participants may direct the trustee how to vote the shares credited to their accounts. The trustee will vote all shares for
which it does not receive timely instructions from participants in the same proportion as shares for which the trustee received voting
instructions from other plan participants. The deadline for returning your voting instruction card is May 15, 2017.

Solicitation of Proxies

First Interstate will pay for this proxy solicitation. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC, a
proxy solicitation firm, will assist First Interstate in soliciting proxies for the annual meeting. First Interstate will pay $7,500 for these
services plus out-of-pocket expenses. Additionally, directors, officers and employees of First Interstate may solicit proxies personally
and by telephone. None of these persons will receive additional or special compensation for soliciting proxies. First Interstate will,
upon request, reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for their expenses in sending proxy materials to their customers who are
beneficial owners and obtaining their voting instructions.

PROPOSAL NO. 1

APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

At First Interstate’s annual meeting of shareholders, First Interstate shareholders will consider and vote on a proposal to approve
and adopt the merger agreement. Details about the merger agreement, including each party’s reasons for the merger, the effect of
approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the timing of effectiveness of the merger, are discussed in the section entitled
“Description of the Merger” beginning on page 55 of this document.

First Interstate’s board of directors unanimously recommends
that First Interstate shareholders vote “FOR”

approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

PROPOSAL NO. 2

APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OF FIRST INTERSTATE

At First Interstate’s annual meeting of shareholders, shareholders will consider and vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the
amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate, which would become effective upon the completion of the merger.
The changes to the articles of incorporation generally provide that the holders of First Interstate Class A common stock and First
Interstate Class B common stock will receive the same consideration in certain mergers and other transactions unless the merger or
other transaction is approved by holders of 70% of First Interstate Class A common stock, voting as a separate class. More specifically,
the changes to the articles of incorporation include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

 

•  In the case of (1) a “Change in Control Transaction” (which is defined in the amended and restated articles of incorporation
of First Interstate as the sale by First Interstate of all or substantially all of the its assets or those of a significant subsidiary or
the merger of First Interstate with or into any other corporation or entity) or (2) the issuance of more than 2% of First
Interstate’s total voting power to any

Table of Contents

 

person or group such that, following such transaction, such person or group would hold more than 50% of the total voting
power of First Interstate, First Interstate will need to obtain the approval of the holders of the greater of: (A) a majority of
the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of First Interstate common stock voting together as a single class or
(B) two-thirds (66.67%) of the voting power of the shares of First Interstate common stock present in person or represented
by proxy at the shareholder meeting called to consider such Change in Control Transaction and entitled to vote thereon,
voting together as a single class. However, unless the holders of First Interstate Class A common stock and First Interstate
Class B common stock receive the same consideration for their shares in a Change in Control Transaction, First Interstate
will not consummate such Change in Control Transaction without the approval of the holders of at least 70% of the voting
power of the outstanding shares of First Interstate Class A common stock, voting as a separate class.

 

 

•  If First Interstate elects to consider a Change in Control Transaction and in the twelve months before such Change in Control
Transaction the acquiring company acquired any shares of First Interstate Class B common stock, then such Change in
Control Transaction will require the affirmative vote of 70% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of First Interstate
Class A common stock, voting as a separate class, unless the holders of the First Interstate Class A common stock and First
Interstate Class B common stock receive the same consideration for their shares in the Change in Control Transaction and
the consideration paid is at least equal to the highest amount paid by the acquiring corporation for the First Interstate Class B
common stock during such twelve-month period.

 

 

•  First Interstate cannot merge with or sell any material assets to any shareholder of First Interstate Class B common stock,
which we refer to in this document as a “Class B Acquisition Transaction,” unless such transaction is approved by a majority
of the disinterested directors on First Interstate’s board of directors and the holders of a majority of the shares of First
Interstate Class A common stock, voting as a separate class.

 

 

•  If there are any shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding, amendment of any of the provisions in the amended
and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate relating to First Interstate common stock, a Change in Control
Transaction, a Class B Acquisition Transaction or an amendment to the articles of incorporation requires the affirmative vote
of 70% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the First Interstate Class A common stock, voting as a separate
class.

The foregoing description of the amended and restated articles of incorporation does not purport to be complete and is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the amended and restated articles of incorporation, which are included as Annex D to this document and are
incorporated into this document by reference.

Approval of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate is a condition to completion of the merger.
Therefore, if the merger agreement is approved by the shareholders of First Interstate but the amended and restated articles of
incorporation are not, First Interstate will not complete the merger unless the condition is waived by First Interstate and Cascade.

First Interstate’s board of directors unanimously recommends
that First Interstate shareholders vote “FOR”

approval and adoption of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate.

PROPOSAL NO. 3

ADJOURNMENT OF THE ANNUAL MEETING

If there are insufficient proxies at the time of the meeting to approve and adopt the merger agreement or approve the amended and
restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate, the First Interstate shareholders may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the
meeting to a later date to allow additional time to solicit

additional proxies. First Interstate’s board of directors does not currently intend to propose adjournment at the meeting if there are
sufficient votes to approve and adopt the merger agreement (Proposal No. 1) and approve the amended and restated articles of
incorporation of First Interstate (Proposal No. 2).

First Interstate board of directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR”
approval of the adjournment of the shareholder meeting if necessary

to solicit additional proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement
or the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate.

PROPOSAL NO. 4

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

A total of four directors will be elected to the First Interstate board of directors at the First Interstate annual meeting of
shareholders to serve three-year terms, or until their respective successors have been elected and appointed. Charles M. Heyneman’s
term as a director will expire at the annual meeting, at which point the First Interstate board of directors will be reduced to 15 members.
The First Interstate board of directors has nominated for election as directors:
 

 •  Steven J. Corning
 

 •  Dana L. Crandall
 

 •  Charles E. Hart, M.D.
 

 •  Peter I. Wold

All of the director nominees are current members of the First Interstate board of directors.

Unless authority to vote is withheld, the persons named in the enclosed First Interstate proxy card will vote the shares represented
by such proxy “FOR” the election of the above named nominees. If, at the time of the First Interstate annual meeting of shareholders,
any nominee becomes unavailable for any reason for election as a director, the persons entitled to vote the First Interstate proxy will
vote for the election of such substitute(s) as the First Interstate board of directors may recommend. At this time, the First Interstate
board of directors knows of no reason why any nominee might be unavailable to serve.

PROPOSAL NO. 5

ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Section 14A of the Exchange Act provides First Interstate shareholders an opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote to
approve the compensation of the “named executive officers” identified in the Summary Compensation Table included on page 152 of
this document.

First Interstate’s general compensation philosophy is that executive compensation should align with First Interstate shareholders’
interests without encouraging excessive or unnecessary risk. First Interstate executive compensation programs, which are described in
greater detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this document beginning on page 142, are designed to attract
and retain qualified executive officers and establish an appropriate relationship between executive pay and First Interstate’s annual
financial performance and long-term growth objectives. Long-term executive compensation, through awards of restricted First
Interstate Class A common stock containing time- and performance-based vesting provisions, encourages growth in executive stock
ownership and helps drive performance that rewards both executives and First Interstate shareholders.

The advisory vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of executive compensation; rather, the
advisory vote relates to the compensation of the First Interstate named executive officers as disclosed in this document in accordance
with the SEC’s compensation disclosure rules. The vote is advisory only, which means that it is not binding on First Interstate, the First
Interstate board of directors or the compensation committee of the First Interstate board of directors. The First Interstate board of
directors and its compensation committee value the opinions of the First Interstate shareholders and therefore will take into account the
outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.

Accordingly, the First Interstate shareholders are requested to vote on the following resolution at the First Interstate annual
meeting of shareholders:

RESOLVED, that the First Interstate shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the First Interstate named
executive officers, as disclosed in this document pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this document, the Summary Compensation Table included in this document
and the other related tables and disclosures included in this document.

First Interstate’s board of directors unanimously recommends that
First Interstate shareholders vote “FOR” the approval of the compensation of

the First Interstate named executive officers as disclosed in this document.

PROPOSAL NO. 6

ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF
FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Section 14A of the Exchange Act also provides First Interstate shareholders an opportunity every six years to cast a non-binding
advisory vote as to how frequently First Interstate should include a proposal, similar to Proposal No. 5, asking for a non-binding
advisory vote on the compensation of the First Interstate named executive officers. Therefore, First Interstate shareholders are being
asked at the First Interstate annual meeting of shareholders to express their preference as to whether an advisory vote to approve the
compensation of the First Interstate named executive officers should be included every one, two or three years. First Interstate
shareholders may also abstain from casting a vote on this proposal.

At the 2011 First Interstate annual meeting of shareholders, the last time the First Interstate shareholders voted on this matter,
more than 85% of the votes cast by the First Interstate shareholders were cast in favor of an advisory vote on executive compensation
every two years. First Interstate has accordingly held an advisory vote on executive compensation every other year since that meeting.
In light of this result, reconsideration of the frequency alternatives and the experience of the First Interstate board of directors over the
last six years, and other factors, the First Interstate board of directors continues to believe that conducting an advisory vote on
executive compensation every two years is appropriate and reflects a compromise between the advantages of the annual and the
triennial voting alternatives. The First Interstate board of directors also believes a vote every two years allows shareholders to evaluate
the longer term effects of First Interstate’s compensation programs, including First Interstate’s multi-year compensation structures, and
is sensitive to shareholders who may not have sufficient time to perform an annual review of pay practices. First Interstate shareholders
who may have concerns about executive compensation during the intervals between advisory votes are welcome to bring their specific
concerns to the attention of the First Interstate board of directors. Information about communicating with the First Interstate board of
directors is included under the caption “Shareholder Communications with the First Interstate Board of Directors” on page 139 of this
document.

This vote is advisory and therefore not binding on First Interstate, the First Interstate board of directors or the compensation
committee of the First Interstate board of directors. The First Interstate board of directors and its compensation committee value the
opinions of the First Interstate shareholders, and therefore will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering the
frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. The First Interstate board of directors may decide that it is in the best
interests of First Interstate and the First Interstate shareholders to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation on a different
frequency than the frequency receiving the most votes cast by the First Interstate shareholders.

The First Interstate proxy card included with this document provides First Interstate shareholders with the opportunity to choose
among four options on this proposal (holding the advisory vote every one, two or three years, or abstaining) and, therefore, First
Interstate shareholders will not be voting to approve or disapprove the recommendation of the First Interstate board of directors.

Our next advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation will occur at our 2023 annual meeting of
shareholders.

First Interstate’s board of directors unanimously recommends that
First Interstate shareholders vote for the option of “TWO YEARS” for

the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation.

PROPOSAL NO. 7

RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

RSM US LLP was appointed by the audit committee of the First Interstate board of directors to be the independent registered
public accounting firm for First Interstate for the year ending December 31, 2017. While the audit committee is directly responsible for
the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the selected independent registered public accounting firm, the audit
committee and the First Interstate board of directors are submitting the selection of RSM US LLP to the First Interstate shareholders
for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. No representatives of RSM US LLP are expected to be present at the First
Interstate annual meeting of shareholders.

Neither the audit committee nor the First Interstate board of directors is required to take any action as a result of the outcome of
the vote on this proposal. If the First Interstate shareholders do not ratify the selection of RSM US LLP as the selected independent
registered public accounting firm, however, the audit committee will consider whether to retain RSM US LLP or to select another
independent registered public accounting firm. Furthermore, even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee in its discretion may
appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change is in
the best interest of First Interstate and the First Interstate shareholders.

First Interstate’s board of directors unanimously recommends
that First Interstate shareholders vote “FOR”

ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP
as the independent registered public accounting firm for First Interstate.

Role of the First Interstate Board of Directors in Risk Oversight

It is the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer to fulfill the expectation of the First Interstate board of directors of a strong
risk management culture throughout the organization. It is the responsibility of the Chief Risk Officer to ensure an appropriate risk
management framework is implemented to identify, assess and manage our exposure to risk. The First Interstate board of directors and
its committees play an important role in overseeing executive management’s performance of its responsibilities relating to risk
management. In general, this oversight includes working with executive management to determine an appropriate risk management
culture, monitoring the amounts and types of risk taken in executing First Interstate’s business strategy and evaluating the effectiveness
of risk management processes against the policies and procedures established to control those risks. First Interstate has adopted a risk
management oversight structure designed to ensure that all significant risks are actively monitored by the entire First Interstate board of
directors or one of its committees. Furthermore, given the importance of the operations of First Interstate Bank to First Interstate,
additional risk management oversight is provided by the First Interstate Bank board of directors, members of which include members
of the First Interstate board of directors.

In most cases, the respective committees of the First Interstate board of directors are responsible for the oversight of specific risks
as outlined in each of their respective charters. For example, the risk oversight responsibilities of the credit committee of the First
Interstate board of directors include oversight of the annual credit plan, lending policies, credit trends, the allowance for loan loss
policy and high risk portfolios and concentrations. In addition to its oversight of all aspects of the First Interstate annual independent
audit and the preparation of the First Interstate financial statements, the audit committee of the First Interstate board of directors has
been delegated responsibility for oversight of risks associated with First Interstate’s internal controls, compliance with applicable laws
and regulations, monitoring the implementation of First Interstate’s code of conduct and overseeing responses to reports of
examination. The compensation committee of the First Interstate board of directors has been delegated responsibility for oversight of
the First Interstate compensation

programs, including evaluating whether any of these programs contain features that promote excessive risk-taking by management and
other employees, either individually or as a group. The executive committee of the First Interstate board of directors oversees the First
Interstate capital positions and capital management activities to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and to
ensure that capital levels are a source of financial strength. The governance and nominating committee of the First Interstate board of
directors has been delegated responsibility for establishing and reviewing the adequacy of the First Interstate code of conduct and
ethics, reviewing and approving related party transactions, developing criteria and qualifications for membership on the First Interstate
board of directors, considering, recommending and recruiting candidates to fill new or vacant positions on the First Interstate board of
directors, and ensuring an effective and efficient system of governance is in place. The technology committee of the First Interstate
board of directors has been delegated responsibility for ensuring adequate processes are in place to protect First Interstate’s data. First
Interstate’s newly formed risk committee further assists the First Interstate board of directors in fulfilling its risk oversight
responsibilities by ensuring its risk governance processes are strong, enterprise-wide risk monitoring activities are appropriate and the
enterprise-wide risk program is effective.

In addition to oversight of risk management by the First Interstate board of directors and its committees, the board of directors of
First Interstate Bank and its committees have been delegated the responsibility for overseeing management of First Interstate Bank’s
lending activities, liquidity and capital position, asset quality, interest rate risk and investment strategies. The chairman of the First
Interstate Bank board of directors communicates relevant information with respect to these activities to the full First Interstate board of
directors.

The several committees of the First Interstate board of directors carry out their responsibilities by requesting and obtaining reports
and other information from First Interstate management with respect to relevant risk areas. In addition to the committee structure of the
First Interstate board of directors, the entire First Interstate board of directors periodically receives reports and information about key
risks and enterprise risk management from the chief risk officer.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

The charter of the audit committee of the First Interstate board of directors requires advance approval of all audit and non-audit
services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to assure that such services do not impair the auditor’s
independence from First Interstate. The audit committee may delegate the authority to pre-approve services to its chairman or any two
other members of the audit committee, subject to ratification by the audit committee at its next committee meeting. In 2016 and 2015,
all of the fees paid to the First Interstate independent auditor were approved in advance by the audit committee.

Audit Committee Report

The Audit Committee of the First Interstate board of directors makes the following report which, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in any of our filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, will not be incorporated by reference into any such
filings and will not otherwise be deemed to be proxy soliciting materials or to be filed under such Acts.

February 27, 2017

To the Board of Directors of First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.:

The audit committee operates under a charter approved by the First Interstate board of directors that specifies the scope of the
audit committee’s responsibilities and how they are carried out. The First Interstate board of directors has determined that all members
of the audit committee are independent based upon the standards adopted by the First Interstate board of directors, which standards
incorporate the independence requirements under applicable laws and regulations.

Management is responsible for First Interstate’s systems of internal controls and the financial reporting process. RSM US LLP,
First Interstate’s independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for the integrated audit of the consolidated financial
statements and internal control over financial reporting. First Interstate’s internal auditors are responsible for preparing an annual audit
plan and conducting internal audits under the control of the Chief Audit Executive, who is accountable to the audit committee.

The audit committee’s responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes and procedures.

The audit committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to it and on the representations made
by management regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and that such financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The audit committee also relies
on the opinions of the independent auditors on the consolidated financial statements and on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. The audit committee’s oversight does not provide assurance that management’s and the auditor’s opinions and
representations are correct.

The audit committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016
with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors. The audit committee’s review of and discussions about the
financial statements included discussions about the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles used, the
reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.

The audit committee also discussed with the independent auditors all matters required to be discussed by the applicable standards
issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and has received the written disclosures and the letter from the
independent auditors required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the
independent auditors’ communications with the audit committee concerning independence. The audit committee discussed with the
independent auditors their independence and any relationships that might have an impact on their objectivity and independence, and
reviewed and approved the amount of fees paid for audit and audit-related services.

Table of Contents

Based on the above-mentioned reviews and discussions, and subject to the limitations on its role and responsibilities described
above and in the audit committee charter, on February 27, 2017, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors that the
audited financial statements referred to above be included in First Interstate’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016 for filing with the SEC.

the proposal.

Approval on a non-binding advisory basis of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate requires that the

instructions, broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the voting on the proposal.

Approval to adjourn the meeting if necessary to permit further solicitation of proxies requires that the votes cast in favor of the
proposal exceed the votes cast against the proposal. The failure to vote in person or submit valid proxy instructions, broker non-votes

agreement. Details about the merger agreement, including each party’s reasons for the merger, the effect of approval and adoption of

PROPOSAL NO. 2

NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION THAT WILL OR MAY BECOME PAYABLE
TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF CASCADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER

In accordance with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules of the SEC adopted thereunder, Cascade’s board of
directors is providing shareholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation that will or may
become payable to the five “named executive officers” of Cascade in connection with the merger, as summarized in the table under the
caption “Description of the Merger—Interests of Cascade’s Director and Executive Officers in the Merger—Merger-Related Executive
Compensation for Cascade’s Named Executive Officers” beginning on page 99 of this document.

As described in greater detail under the caption “Description of the Merger—Interests of Cascade’s Director and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Cascade’s Named Executive Officers,” each of Cascade’s named
executive officers will or may become entitled to receive a payment from Cascade. Under SEC rules, Cascade’s shareholders must be
provided with the opportunity to vote on a non-binding advisory resolution to approve certain “golden parachute” payments that its
named executive officers will receive in connection with the merger. The payments to Messrs. Zink, Newton, Reeves and Lee and
Ms. Biss constitute “golden parachute” payments.

Accordingly, at the special meeting, Cascade is asking its shareholders to approve, in a non-binding advisory vote, the
compensation that will or may become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the merger through the adoption of
the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the
merger, as disclosed in the table under the caption “Description of the Merger—Interests of Cascade’s Director and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Cascade’s Named Executive Officers” in the joint proxy
statement/prospectus in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, including the associated narrative discussion, and the
agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, is hereby APPROVED.”

The vote on this Proposal No. 2 is a vote separate and apart from the vote on Proposal No. 1 to approve and adopt the merger
agreement. Accordingly, Cascade’s shareholders may vote not to approve this Proposal No. 2 and to approve Proposal No. 1, and vice
versa. Because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either Cascade or First Interstate, regardless of whether the
merger agreement is approved. Accordingly, as the compensation to be paid in connection with the merger is a contractual obligation to
the named executive officers of Cascade, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, such compensation will be payable if the
merger agreement is approved and the merger is completed, subject only to the contractual conditions applicable to such payment.

Cascade’s board of directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR”
approval, on an advisory non-binding basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable to the named executive

officers of Cascade in connection with the merger.

PROPOSAL NO. 3

NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE AMENDED
AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OF FIRST INTERSTATE

Cascade’s board of directors is providing its shareholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on the
amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate, which would become effective upon the completion of the merger.

The changes to the First Interstate articles of incorporation generally provide that the holders of First Interstate Class A common
stock and First Interstate Class B common stock will receive the same consideration in certain mergers and other transactions unless
the merger or other transaction is approved by holders of 70% of First Interstate Class A common stock, voting as a separate class.
More specifically, the changes to the articles of incorporation include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

 

•  In the case of (1) a “Change in Control Transaction” (which is defined in the amended and restated articles of incorporation
of First Interstate as the sale by First Interstate of all or substantially all of the its assets or those of a significant subsidiary or
the merger of First Interstate with or into any other corporation or entity) or (2) the issuance of more than 2% of First
Interstate’s total voting power to any person or group such that, following such transaction, such person or group would hold
more than 50% of the total voting power of First Interstate, First Interstate will need to obtain the approval of the holders of
the greater of: (A) a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of First Interstate common stock
voting together as a single class or (B) two-thirds (66.67%) of the voting power of the shares of First Interstate common
stock present in person or represented by proxy at the shareholder meeting called to consider such Change in Control
Transaction and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class. However, unless the holders of First Interstate
Class A common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock receive the same consideration for their shares in a
Change in Control Transaction, First Interstate will not consummate such Change in Control Transaction without the
approval of the holders of at least 70% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of First Interstate Class A common
stock, voting as a separate class.

 

 

•  If First Interstate elects to consider a Change in Control Transaction and in the twelve months before such Change in Control
Transaction the acquiring company acquired any shares of First Interstate Class B common stock, then such Change in
Control Transaction will require the affirmative vote of 70% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of First Interstate
Class A common stock, voting as a separate class, unless the holders of the First Interstate Class A common stock and First
Interstate Class B common stock receive the same consideration for their shares in the Change in Control Transaction and
the consideration paid is at least equal to the highest amount paid by the acquiring corporation for the First Interstate Class B
common stock during such twelve-month period.

 

 

•  First Interstate cannot merge with or sell any material assets to any shareholder of First Interstate Class B common stock,
which we refer to in this document as a “Class B Acquisition Transaction,” unless such transaction is approved by a majority
of the disinterested directors on First Interstate’s board of directors and the holders of a majority of the shares of First
Interstate Class A common stock, voting as a separate class.

 

 

•  If there are any shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding, amendment of any of the provisions in the amended
and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate relating to First Interstate common stock, a Change in Control
Transaction, a Class B Acquisition Transaction or an amendment to the articles of incorporation requires the affirmative vote
of 70% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the First Interstate Class A common stock, voting as a separate
class.

The foregoing description of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate does not purport to be complete
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended and restated articles of incorporation, which are included as Annex D to this
document and are incorporated into this document by reference.

Table of Contents

Because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either Cascade or First Interstate, regardless of whether the
merger agreement is approved. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved by Cascade’s shareholders and the merger is
subsequently completed, the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate will be amended, whether or not Cascade
shareholders approve the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate.

Cascade’s board of directors unanimously recommends
that Cascade shareholders vote “FOR” approval, on an advisory non-binding basis, of

the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate.

PROPOSAL NO. 4

ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

If there are insufficient proxies at the time of the special meeting to approve and adopt the merger agreement, the Cascade
shareholders may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn the meeting to a later date to allow additional time to solicit additional
proxies. Cascade’s board of directors does not currently intend to propose adjournment at the special meeting if there are sufficient
votes to approve and adopt the merger agreement (Proposal No. 1).

Cascade’s board of directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR”
approval of the adjournment of the shareholder meeting if necessary

to solicit additional proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

DESCRIPTION OF THE MERGER

The following summary of the merger agreement and the merger is qualified by reference to the complete text of the merger
agreement. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this document and is incorporated by reference into this
document. You should read the merger agreement completely and carefully as it, rather than this description, is the legal document that
governs the merger.

General

The merger agreement provides for the merger of Cascade with and into First Interstate, with First Interstate as the surviving
entity. Immediately following the merger of Cascade with First Interstate, Cascade Bank will merge with and into First Interstate Bank,
with First Interstate Bank as the surviving entity.

Consideration to be Received in the Merger

When the merger becomes effective, each share of Cascade common stock issued and outstanding immediately before completion
of the merger will automatically be converted into the right to receive 0.14864 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and
$1.91 in cash, plus cash in lieu of any fractional share, without interest. The exchange ratio will not be adjusted as a result of any
changes in the trading price of First Interstate Class A common stock or Cascade common stock.

If First Interstate declares a stock dividend or distribution on shares of its Class A common stock or subdivides, splits, reclassifies
or combines the shares of First Interstate Class A common stock before the effective time of the merger, then the exchange ratio will be
adjusted to provide Cascade shareholders with the same economic effect as contemplated by the merger agreement before any of these
events.

Cascade’s shareholders will not receive fractional shares of First Interstate Class A common stock. Instead, Cascade’s
shareholders will receive a cash payment for any fractional shares in an amount equal to the product of (1) the fraction of a share of
First Interstate Class A common stock to which he, she or it is entitled multiplied by (2) the average closing sales price of First
Interstate Class A common stock over the 20 full trading days ending on the fifth day before the closing date of the merger.

Background of and Cascade’s Reasons for the Merger

Background of the Merger.

Cascade’s board of directors has regularly reviewed and discussed Cascade’s business, performance, prospects and long-term
strategy in the context of developments in the banking industry and the competitive and regulatory landscape. Cascade’s board of
directors has considered, from time to time, various potential strategic alternatives, including acquisitions or business combinations
involving other financial institutions, such as potential acquisitions of smaller bank holding companies operating primarily in the
markets in which Cascade operates or business combinations with larger banking institutions. Cascade’s board of directors also
considered standalone alternatives such as increasing its number of traditional bank branches through organic growth or acquiring
branches of other banking institutions. Cascade’s board of directors generally concluded that entering into a strategic transaction with a
larger financial institution would be more likely to enhance shareholder value than to pursue standalone alternatives. In connection
with the evaluation of these strategic alternatives, Terry E. Zink, Cascade’s President and Chief Executive Officer, has had, from time
to time, informal discussions with other financial institutions.

Growth through mergers and acquisitions has been and remains an important part of First Interstate’s growth plans as evidenced
by three acquisitions of financial institutions in the past three years. First Interstate’s management has also been hiring additional
personnel and strengthening its policies, procedures, technology and infrastructure to operate in the enhanced regulatory environment
of a financial institution with assets greater than $10 billion.

Table of Contents

In May 2015, Cascade entered into discussions with a financial institution, referred to in this document as “Party A,” that
approached Cascade about a possible strategic transaction. During June and July 2015, Cascade’s board of directors held several
meetings to consider a potential strategic transaction and conferred with management and Cascade’s financial and legal advisors.
During this time, Cascade’s board of directors considered whether to contact other potential merger partners as well as the potential
benefits and risks of affirmatively soliciting acquisition proposals from such parties (including the risk of potential disruption to
Cascade’s business and relationships with employees and customers should information about the sale process become known to the
public, the risks of sharing competitively sensitive information with Cascade’s competitors and the risk that Party A might withdraw its
interest). Cascade’s board of directors determined that the risks associated with attempting to affirmatively solicit acquisition proposals
from a large number of third parties outweighed the potential benefits. For that reason, Cascade’s board of directors authorized its
financial advisor to contact only four potential merger partners (other than Party A) to assess their interest and ability to consummate a
strategic transaction. Those four potential merger partners were determined, after conferring with Cascade’s management and financial
advisor, to be most likely to be interested in exploring a strategic transaction with Cascade. Cascade did not enter into confidentiality
agreements with any of those four parties or provide them with nonpublic due diligence information. However, one of those potential
merger partners, which we refer to in this document as “Party B,” met with Cascade’s management on July 8 and July 14, 2015, to
discuss a potential strategic transaction. Ultimately, the four potential merger partners either indicated preliminary valuation terms that
led Cascade to conclude a strategic transaction would not be more attractive than the strategic transaction proposed by Party A or
responded that they were not interested in pursuing or were unable to pursue a strategic transaction at that time. As a result, Cascade’s
board of directors authorized Cascade to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Party A and to continue exchanging due diligence
information with respect to a potential strategic transaction. During these discussions, Party A proposed a merger transaction with an
implied value of approximately $6.50 per share at that time, with the consideration to consist of 85% Party A common stock and 15%
cash. Cascade and Party A, however, were unable to agree on definitive terms for a strategic transaction and terminated discussions in
late August 2015.

In early 2016, representatives from each of First Interstate and Party B contacted Mr. Zink to express interest in exploring a
potential strategic transaction. First Interstate had not been contacted by Cascade’s financial advisor during July 2015, but as noted
above, Party B had been contacted and had indicated at that time that it was not then in a position to pursue a strategic transaction with
Cascade.

On February 23, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting at which representatives of management
were present. Cascade’s board of directors was informed by Mr. Zink of the contacts from Party B and First Interstate and directed
management to hold discussions with both parties to assess their interest in a potential strategic transaction.

On March 11, 2016, Kevin P. Riley, President and Chief Executive Officer of First Interstate and Marcy D. Mutch, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of First Interstate, met with Mr. Zink, Gregory D. Newton, Cascade’s Chief Financial Officer,
and other representatives of Cascade in Portland, Oregon, to hold preliminary discussions about a potential strategic transaction.

On March 15, 2016, Cascade entered into a confidentiality agreement (which did not contain standstill covenants) with Party B.

On March 16, 2016, Mr. Zink, Mr. Newton, Charles N. Reeves, Cascade’s Chief Operating Officer, and Ryan R. Patrick,
Cascade’s Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, met with Mr. Riley, Ms. Mutch and James R. Scott, Chairman of the Board of First
Interstate, to discuss preliminarily a potential strategic transaction.

On March 21, 2016, Cascade entered into a confidentiality agreement (which did not contain standstill covenants) with First
Interstate.

After entering into confidentiality agreements with First Interstate and Party B, Cascade provided each party with access to an
electronic data room to conduct due diligence.

On March 22, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management were present. Cascade’s
management updated the directors on the status of the discussions with First Interstate and Party B.

From late March until early May 2016, Cascade and its representatives met and held numerous discussions with representatives of
First Interstate and Party B and exchanged due diligence information. Cascade requested that each party submit an indication of interest
in mid-May.

On March 29, 2016, a representative of another financial institution, referred to as “Party C,” contacted Mr. Zink to express
potential interest in exploring a strategic transaction. Party C was among the potential merger partners considered by Cascade’s board
of directors in July 2015, but Cascade did not contact Party C at that time. Mr. Zink responded that Cascade would be willing to hold
discussions with Party C. Party C’s representative indicated he would send Cascade a proposed confidentiality agreement, but no such
agreement was received. In early May 2016, a representative of Cascade’s outside financial advisor at Piper Jaffray contacted Party C
on Cascade’s behalf because Party C had not yet provided a proposed confidentiality agreement or otherwise communicated with
Cascade about a potential strategic transaction. Although Party C informed the representative of Piper Jaffray that Party C was still
interested in a potential strategic transaction, neither Cascade nor Piper Jaffray received any further contact from Party C regarding
Cascade.

On April 18, 2016, First Interstate held a meeting of its executive committee, which consists of six directors. Representatives of
First Interstate’s management were also present. Mr. Riley provided an overview of the potential strategic transaction with Cascade, of
his previous meetings with representatives of Cascade and preliminary transaction considerations. The executive committee agreed that
management of First Interstate should continue its due diligence and negotiations with Cascade to work towards a potential strategic
transaction with Cascade.

On April 26, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management were present. Cascade’s
management updated the directors on the status of the discussions with First Interstate and Party B.

On May 18, 2016, Party B provided Cascade with a non-binding indication of interest with an implied value of approximately
$6.37 per share, with the consideration to consist of approximately 75% Party B common stock and 25% cash. The stock consideration
was not subject to any “collar,” which would limit the amount by which an acquiror’s stock price could fluctuate between the time
the merger agreement is signed and the time the merger is completed. Party B also requested that Cascade enter into an exclusivity
agreement.

On May 20, 2016, First Interstate provided Cascade with a non-binding expression of interest with an implied value of
approximately $6.19 per share, with the consideration to consist of approximately 75% First Interstate Class A common stock and 25%
cash. The stock consideration was not subject to a “collar.” First Interstate also requested that Cascade enter into an exclusivity
agreement.

On May 24, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management, Piper Jaffray and
Hunton & Williams LLP, Cascade’s outside legal counsel, which we refer to in this document as “Hunton,” were present. Cascade’s
management updated the directors on the discussions held with First Interstate and Party B and explained each party’s stated rationale
for a strategic transaction with Cascade. Representatives of Piper Jaffray reviewed the non-binding indications of interest and provided
a financial analysis of each of Cascade, Party B and First Interstate on a standalone basis and a financial analysis of a potential strategic
transaction with each of Party B and First Interstate. Based on information provided by Piper Jaffray and management, Cascade’s board
of directors also considered, among other things: potential synergies in

a strategic transaction with Party B or First Interstate; whether to affirmatively solicit acquisition proposals from other potential merger
parties (and the risks of doing so); Cascade’s board of directors’ consideration of potential merger partners and the results of the market
outreach efforts conducted by Cascade’s financial advisor in July 2015; the extent to which Party B’s and First Interstate’s operations
overlapped with Cascade’s geographic markets; the dual class structure of First Interstate’s common stock, including the concentration
of voting power held by the holders of First Interstate Class B common stock; the likelihood of consummating a strategic transaction
on a timely basis, including Party B’s and First Interstate’s relative experience in completing acquisitions of financial institutions the
size of Cascade; and the likelihood that the market for Cascade’s common stock was trading at a premium due to speculation that
Cascade was a possible acquisition target. Cascade’s board of directors decided that the risk from a sale process becoming public
outweighed the potential benefits of contacting other potential merger partners. Following discussion, Cascade’s board of directors
instructed management to continue negotiations with each of Party B and First Interstate to seek improved purchase prices from both
parties. After the meeting, Cascade’s representatives requested representatives of each of First Interstate and Party B to improve the
terms of their respective proposals.

On May 25, 2016, First Interstate’s board of directors held a meeting at which members of management were present. Mr. Riley
provided First Interstate’s board of directors with an overview of the potential strategic transaction, preliminary transaction
considerations and an update on the discussions and process. After discussion, First Interstate’s board of directors approved
management’s submission of a new indication of interest.

On May 25, 2016, First Interstate provided Cascade with a non-binding indication of interest with an implied value of
approximately $6.42 per share, with the consideration to consist of approximately 70% First Interstate Class A common stock and 30%
cash. First Interstate again requested that Cascade enter into an exclusivity agreement.

On May 26, 2016, Party B provided Cascade with a revised non-binding indication of interest with an implied value of
approximately $6.47 per share, with the consideration to consist of approximately 75% Party B common stock and 25% cash, and
changes to certain other terms, such as a reduced termination fee that would be payable by Cascade in connection the termination of a
definitive merger agreement under certain circumstances. Party B again requested that Cascade enter into an exclusivity agreement.

On May 27, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management, Piper Jaffray and Hunton
were present. Representatives of Piper Jaffray reviewed the revised non-binding indications of interest and its updated financial
analysis. Representatives of Hunton also reviewed the directors’ legal duties applicable to their consideration of a strategic transaction.
Following discussion, Cascade’s board of directors determined that pursuing a strategic transaction with Party B at that time was more
likely to maximize shareholder value because: Party B’s proposal offered a higher implied value to Cascade’s shareholders; Cascade’s
board of directors’ belief, based on information provided by management and Piper Jaffray, that a strategic transaction with Party B
could be completed more promptly than a strategic transaction with First Interstate and also might create more synergies; and Party B’s
single class of common stock was considered more favorable to Cascade’s shareholders than First Interstate’s dual class stock structure.
Cascade’s board of directors instructed management to try to seek improved terms from Party B and authorized management to enter
into an exclusivity agreement. After the meeting, Mr. Zink negotiated the terms of non-binding indication of interest with
representatives of Party B, including seeking an improvement in Party B’s purchase price.

On May 31, 2016, Party B submitted a revised non-binding indication of interest in which it increased its proposed exchange ratio
(with the consideration still to consist of approximately 75% Party B common stock and 25% cash), resulting in an implied value of
approximately $6.50 per share. Party B again requested that Cascade enter into an exclusivity agreement. Mr. Zink provided the revised
non-binding indication of interest to Cascade’s directors.

On June 1, 2016, Cascade and Party B executed a non-binding indication of interest and entered into a 60-day exclusivity period.
Mr. Zink also informed Mr. Riley of Cascade’s board of directors’ decision not to continue discussions with First Interstate. Mr. Riley
indicated that Cascade should contact First Interstate if circumstances changed.

During June and July 2016, Cascade and Party B conducted due diligence with respect to the potential transaction.

On July 20 and 21, 2016, First Interstate’s board of directors held meetings at which representatives of management were present.
Ms. Mutch provided an update to First Interstate’s board of directors on Cascade’s decision not to continue discussions with First
Interstate.

On July 26, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management were present. Among
other things, Cascade’s board of directors was updated on the status of the discussions and due diligence process with Party B.

On July 29, 2016, Party B submitted a revised indication of interest pursuant to which it reduced the exchange ratio in its proposal
but increased the cash portion of the merger consideration (which cash portion constituted approximately 30% of the implied value of
the total consideration payable to Cascade’s shareholders). Because of the reduced exchange ratio and the fact that Party B’s stock price
had declined over the past two months, the implied value reflected in Party B’s revised indication of interest was approximately $6.14
per share. Party B also requested a 14-day extension of the exclusivity period. Later that day, Cascade’s board of directors held a
meeting at which representatives of management and Piper Jaffray were present to consider Party B’s revised indication of interest.
Following discussion, Cascade’s board of directors agreed to continue negotiations with Party B and to extend the exclusivity period by
an additional 14 days.

On August 8, 2016, Party B’s legal counsel provided a draft merger agreement to Hunton. Over the next two weeks, the parties
continued their due diligence with respect to the potential transaction and their respective legal counsel negotiated the terms of the
merger agreement. During this period, Party B withdrew a request previously made during negotiations that Cascade directors who
were affiliated with certain Cascade shareholders would have to enter into non-competition agreements with Party B in connection with
a strategic transaction.

On August 10, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management, Piper Jaffray and
Hunton were present. At this meeting, Cascade’s board of directors was advised that certain Cascade directors and Piper Jaffray had
been contacted by a representative of Barclays, First Interstate’s financial advisor, who expressed First Interstate’s continuing interest
in exploring a strategic transaction on the same terms set forth in First Interstate’s May 26, 2016, indication of interest. Because
Cascade was subject to the exclusivity agreement with Party B and because Cascade’s board of directors continued to consider a
strategic transaction with Party B to be more favorable to Cascade’s shareholders than a strategic transaction with First Interstate based
on First Interstate’s prior indications of interest, Cascade’s board of directors concluded that Cascade should continue pursuing a
strategic transaction with Party B. Representatives of Piper Jaffray reviewed a preliminary financial analysis of the potential transaction
with Party B. Representatives of Hunton reviewed the material terms of the merger agreement and the voting agreement that Party B
had requested from Cascade’s directors and certain Cascade shareholders. Cascade’s board of directors also authorized an additional
six-day extension of exclusivity.

On August 16, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management and Piper were present.
At this meeting, Cascade’s management updated Cascade’s board of directors on the status of the negotiations and due diligence with
Party B. Cascade’s board of directors agreed to extend the exclusivity agreement with Party B for an additional three weeks for
continued due diligence.

On August 23, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management were present. Among
other things, Cascade’s board of directors was updated on the progress of the proposed transaction with Party B.

Between August 23 and August 30, 2016, representatives of Cascade and Party B continued to hold discussions, but by August 30
each party concluded that a satisfactory agreement could not be reached at that time. Party B released Cascade from its exclusivity
obligations.

On August 30, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management and Piper were present
to update Cascade’s directors on the termination of the negotiations with Party B. Cascade’s board of directors considered whether to
reengage with First Interstate in light of various factors, including its prior determination that a strategic transaction was more likely to
enhance shareholder value than pursuing standalone alternatives; the trading price of First Interstate Class A common stock had
increased since May 20, 2016, which had the effect of increasing the implied value of First Interstate’s proposal as set forth in its last
indication of interest; the communication from Barclays indicating First Interstate remained interested in pursuing a strategic
transaction with Cascade; and Cascade could take advantage of the recent due diligence process with Party B by promptly providing
First Interstate with due diligence information to facilitate each party’s decision whether to engage in more serious discussions.
Following discussion, Cascade’s board of directors authorized Cascade’s representatives to contact First Interstate to determine
whether it was still interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with Cascade. After this meeting, a representative of Piper Jaffray
contacted a representative of Barclays, who confirmed that First Interstate remained interested in a potential strategic transaction with
Cascade.

On September 1, 2016, Mr. Riley contacted Mr. Zink and expressed First Interstate’s continued interest in negotiating a strategic
transaction with Cascade. Mr. Zink indicated that the parties should promptly exchange due diligence information to determine whether
an acceptable transaction could be reached.

On September 9, 2016, Messrs. Zink, Newton and Patrick met with Mr. Riley and Ms. Mutch in Boise, Idaho, to discuss a
strategic transaction. The parties agreed to continue discussions to determine whether a mutually acceptable transaction could be
reached.

On September 21 and 22, 2016, First Interstate’s board of directors held meetings at which representatives of management were
present. Ms. Mutch discussed with First Interstate’s board of directors the renewed discussions with Cascade, an overview of the
potential strategic transaction and certain transaction considerations. The board authorized management to submit a revised
non-binding indication of interest.

On September 23, 2016, First Interstate provided Cascade with a revised non-binding indication of interest with an implied value
of approximately $6.87 per share, with the consideration to consist of approximately 72% First Interstate Class A common stock
pursuant to an exchange ratio of 0.15505 and 28% cash pursuant to a fixed cash payment of $1.91 per share. It also included a “collar”
on the stock consideration pursuant to which the exchange ratio would be adjusted but only if the value of First Interstate Class A
common stock at closing was greater or lower than a specified price such that the value of First Interstate common stock payable for
each share of Cascade common stock in the merger would be not less than $3.82 per share (the “floor”) and not more than $5.17 per
share (the “cap”). In addition, First Interstate indicated that it would increase the size of its board of directors to include two directors
from Cascade’s board and that it would require voting agreements from certain of Cascade’s shareholders. First Interstate also
requested a 60-day exclusivity period to negotiate a definitive agreement.

On September 27, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management and Piper Jaffray
were present. Representatives of Piper Jaffray reviewed the terms of the revised indication of interest and provided a financial analysis
of First Interstate and its proposal, including the terms of the collar and that First Interstate’s stock price had risen by approximately
9.9% since its May 25, 2016 proposal. Representatives of Piper Jaffray also expressed their view that Cascade’s common stock was
still trading at a premium due to continued speculation that Cascade was a possible acquisition target. Among other things, Cascade’s
directors considered the dual class structure of First Interstate’s common stock and whether it was desirable to include an additional
director from Cascade’s board on First Interstate’s board of directors with

experience in Cascade’s markets in which First Interstate did not already operate. After discussion, Cascade’s board of directors
authorized management to continue discussions with First Interstate and to request a shorter exclusivity period, a more favorable collar
and three seats on First Interstate’s board of directors.

After the meeting, Mr. Zink conveyed the requests of Cascade’s board of directors to Mr. Riley, and representatives of Cascade
and First Interstate continued to negotiate the terms of a potential transaction. During this time, First Interstate agreed to reduce its
requested exclusivity period to 45 days.

On September 29, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management and Piper Jaffray
were present. At this meeting, Mr. Zink updated Cascade’s directors on the status of the negotiations with First Interstate.

On October 3, 2016, First Interstate provided Cascade with a revised non-binding indication of interest in which it raised the floor
of the collar to $3.88 but did not increase the cap. Later that day, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives
of management and Piper Jaffray were present. Mr. Zink reviewed the terms of First Interstate’s revised non-binding indication of
interest. Mr. Zink informed Cascade’s directors, however, that First Interstate was unwilling to increase the cap in the collar. Following
discussion, Cascade’s board of directors authorized management to enter into a 45-day exclusivity arrangement and to continue
negotiations with First Interstate.

On October 4, 2016, Cascade and First Interstate entered into a 45-day exclusivity agreement. Over the next two weeks,
representatives of Cascade and First Interstate conducted due diligence with respect to a potential strategic transaction.

On October 13, 2016, Cascade’s representatives provided First Interstate with a draft merger agreement.

On October 21, 2016, Luse Gorman, PC, outside counsel to First Interstate, which we refer to in this document as “Luse
Gorman,” sent Hunton comments on the draft merger agreement.

On October 25, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management, Piper Jaffray and
Hunton were present. Cascade’s board of directors was updated by representatives of management and Hunton on the status of the due
diligence process. Representatives of Hunton also reviewed the directors’ fiduciary duties in the context of the potential transaction, the
regulatory approval process for the merger and the material terms of the merger agreement, including First Interstate’s proposed
termination fee equal to 5% of the transaction’s equity value and that Cascade could not terminate the merger agreement to accept a
superior proposal from a third party. Cascade’s board of directors instructed Hunton to seek more favorable terms in the merger
agreement, including a lower termination fee payable if Cascade’s board of directors changed its recommendation of the merger and
the ability to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal. Cascade’s board of directors also discussed First Interstate’s
dual class stock structure with Hunton and instructed Hunton to negotiate certain changes to First Interstate’s articles of incorporation
that would provide additional protections to First Interstate’s Class A shareholders in any future sale transaction.

On October 26, 2016, Hunton sent a revised draft of the merger agreement and a proposed draft of the voting agreement to Luse
Gorman. Over the next week, representatives of Hunton and Luse Gorman negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and voting
agreements. Among other things, First Interstate agreed to a termination fee equal to 3.75% of the transaction value and to allow
Cascade to terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances to accept a superior proposal from a third party. First Interstate
did not agree, however, to increase from two to three the number of directors from Cascade’s board of directors that would join First
Interstate’s board of directors. In addition, First Interstate indicated it would not agree to Cascade’s proposed changes to First
Interstate’s articles of incorporation.

On November 3, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management, Piper Jaffray and
Hunton were present. Cascade’s board of directors was updated by management

on the status of the due diligence process. Hunton provided an update on the status of the negotiations and reviewed the proposed terms
of the merger agreement and voting agreements, which would be entered into by the directors and certain shareholders of each of
Cascade and First Interstate. Representatives of Piper Jaffray reviewed an updated financial analysis of the proposed transaction.
Among other things, Cascade’s board of directors agreed that Cascade’s representatives should continue to seek changes to First
Interstate’s articles of incorporation to address concerns over the concentrated voting power among the holders of First Interstate
Class B common stock as it would relate to any future sale transaction.

Over the next two weeks, representatives of First Interstate and Cascade continued to negotiate the terms of the transaction.
During this time, First Interstate agreed to certain changes to its articles of incorporation to provide additional protections to First
Interstate Class A shareholders. Specifically, First Interstate agreed that its articles of incorporation would be amended to require a
supermajority vote of First Interstate Class A shareholders voting as a single class if First Interstate Class A shareholders and First
Interstate Class B shareholders were to be provided different consideration in a future sale transaction. The parties also exchanged
revised drafts of the merger agreement and voting agreements.

On November 8, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management, Piper Jaffray and
Hunton were present. At this meeting, Cascade’s directors expressed concern that, because of a recent increase in First Interstate’s
stock price, the cap in the collar had already been reached and therefore would prevent Cascade’s shareholders from benefitting from
any further appreciation in First Interstate’s stock price before closing. Cascade’s board of directors directed management to seek
improved terms to the collar. Cascade’s board of directors also discussed with Hunton the proposed terms of the amendment to First
Interstate’s articles of incorporation.

On November 10, 2016, Mr. Zink negotiated the terms of the collar with Mr. Riley and requested that the cap be increased to
provide Cascade’s shareholders with greater value resulting from an increase in the trading price of First Interstate common stock.
Mr. Riley informed Mr. Zink that First Interstate would be willing to remove the collar in exchange for lowering the exchange ratio to
0.14864.

On November 11, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management, Piper Jaffray and
Hunton were present. Representatives of management and Piper Jaffray reviewed First Interstate’s revised proposal to eliminate the
collar in exchange for a reduction in the exchange ratio. Among other things, Cascade’s board of directors considered and discussed
with management and Piper Jaffray the implied value of First Interstate’s revised proposal, the benefits to eliminating the cap, the
disadvantages to eliminating the floor, First Interstate’s prospects and various factors that might adversely or positively affect the
market price for shares of Cascade common stock and First Interstate common stock, including the banking industry’s prospects in
light of the outcome of the presidential election. Following discussion, Cascade’s board of directors agreed to First Interstate’s proposal
and instructed management to finalize a definitive merger agreement. Also on November 11, 2016, Luse Gorman sent Hunton a revised
draft merger agreement.

On November 15, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management, Piper Jaffray and
Hunton were present. Representatives of Hunton reviewed the changes to the merger agreement and the voting agreements.
Representatives of Piper Jaffray reviewed an updated financial analysis of the proposed transaction.

On November 16, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of management, Piper Jaffray and
Hunton were present. A representative of Piper Jaffray reviewed financial analyses relating to Cascade, First Interstate and the
proposed transaction and delivered to Cascade’s board of directors an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect
that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the merger
consideration to be paid to the holders of outstanding shares of Cascade’s common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders. See “The Merger—Opinion of Cascade’s Financial Advisor”

merger agreement and ancillary documents, consideration of other relevant issues, including a variety of business, financial and market
factors, including those set forth below under “The Merger—Reasons for the Merger” and the delivery of Piper Jaffray’s fairness
opinion, Cascade’s board of directors unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement.

Also on November 16, 2016, First Interstate’s board of directors held a meeting at which representatives of First Interstate’s
senior management, Barclays and Luse Gorman were present. Representatives of Barclays reviewed the financial analysis supporting
its proposed opinion. After discussion among First Interstate’s board of directors and its advisors, representatives of Barclays delivered
an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated November 16, 2016, to First Interstate’s board of directors to the
effect that, as of such date and based on and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the merger
consideration to be paid by First Interstate in the proposed merger was fair to First Interstate from a financial point of view. See “The
Merger—Opinion of First Interstate’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 79 of this document for more information about Barclays’
fairness opinion. First Interstate’s board of directors was updated on the results of the completion of the legal and business due
diligence review of Cascade. A representative of Luse Gorman reviewed in detail the terms of the merger agreement and voting
agreements to be entered into by the directors.

On November 17, 2016, First Interstate’s board of directors held a meeting and, following a discussion of the previous day’s
presentations and further discussion among the members of First Interstate’s board of directors, unanimously approved the merger
agreement. Later that day, Cascade and First Interstate entered into the merger agreement and announced the merger. The parties to the
voting agreements also entered into the voting agreements.

Cascade’s Reasons for the Merger.

In reaching a determination to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger,
Cascade’s board of directors considered a number of factors, both positive and negative, and potential benefits and detriments of the
merger to Cascade and its shareholders. Cascade’s board of directors identified the following factors and benefits of the merger that,
among others, Cascade’s board of directors believes generally support its decision and recommendation:
 

 
•  Cascade’s board of directors’ understanding of, and presentations of Cascade’s management regarding, the business, growth

prospects, current and projected financial condition, assets, results of operations, business strategy and current and
prospective regulatory environment of both Cascade and First Interstate;

 

 

•  Cascade’s board of directors’ consideration of certain other potential strategic alternatives for Cascade, including continuing
to operate as a standalone company and the potential to acquire, be acquired or combine with third parties, and the risks and
uncertainties associated with each alternative, as well as Cascade’s board of directors’ assessment that none of these
alternatives was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for Cascade to create greater value for Cascade’s
shareholders, taking into account the timing and the likelihood of accomplishing such alternatives and the risks of execution,
as well as business, competitive, industry and market risks;

 

 

•  the financial information and analyses presented by Piper Jaffray to Cascade’s board of directors, and Piper Jaffray’s
opinion, dated November 16, 2016, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors,
qualifications and limitations set forth in the opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to
holders of Cascade common stock;

 

 
•  that the merger consideration represents a premium of 17.3%, based on the cash portion of the merger consideration and the

20-day volume weighted average price for the twenty days prior to the public announcement of the merger, and a premium
of 9.6% per share, based on the cash portion of the

merger consideration and the closing prices of Cascade common stock and First Interstate Class A common stock on
November 16, 2016, the day before the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement;

 

 

•  Cascade’s closing condition in the merger agreement that it will have received the opinion of Hunton that the merger will
qualify as a “reorganization” within Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and Cascade’s board of directors’
expectation that Cascade’s shareholders will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of the completion of the merger, except with respect to the cash portion of the merger consideration and any cash they
receive for fractional shares;

 

 
•  the results of Cascade’s due diligence investigation of First Interstate, including the impact of First Interstate exceeding the

$10 billion asset threshold;
 

 
•  that the merger will result in a combined company with greater financial resources and a higher lending limit than Cascade

would have if it were to continue its operations as an independent entity;
 

 
•  the anticipated cost savings from expected increases in operating efficiency, reduced payments to vendors and third parties

and elimination of duplicate executive management positions, while increasing responsiveness to compliance and regulatory
requirements;

 

 
•  the lack of geographic overlap between Cascade and First Interstate, which will expand and diversify the markets in which

the combined company operates and is expected to result in a high rate of retention of Cascade’s employees after the
announcement of the merger, which retention is expected to benefit the combined company;

 

 

•  the view of Cascade’s management that the merger will allow for greater opportunities for Cascade’s clients, customers and
other constituencies within the communities in which Cascade operates, and that the potential synergies, low loan and
deposit concentration levels allowing greater growth in all classes of commercial lending and diversification resulting from
the merger will enhance product offerings and customer service beyond the level believed to be reasonably achievable by
Cascade on an independent basis;

 

 
•  the recommendation of Cascade’s management in favor of the merger, considered in light of the benefits to be received by

them in connection with the merger;
 

 
•  that upon consummation of the merger, First Interstate’s board of directors will contain two current members of Cascade’s

board of directors;
 

 
•  that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including, but not limited to, the representations, warranties and

covenants of the parties, the conditions to completion of the merger and the form and structure of the merger consideration,
are reasonable;

 

 
•  the likelihood that the merger will be completed based on, among other things, (1) each party’s obligation to use its

reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals as promptly as practicable and (2) the limited closing conditions
contained in the merger agreement;

 

 
•  that the merger agreement provides Cascade with the ability to seek specific performance by First Interstate of its obligations

under the merger agreement, including to consummate the merger;
 

 
•  the stock portion of the merger consideration is a fixed exchange ratio of shares of Cascade common stock to First Interstate

Class A common stock; as a result, Cascade’s shareholders could benefit from an increase in the trading price of First
Interstate Class A common stock during the pendency of the merger;

 

 
•  First Interstate’s agreement to amend and restate its articles of incorporation to generally provide that the holders of First

Interstate Class A common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock will receive the same consideration in mergers
and other transactions, and that such provision would not be changed except by a supermajority vote; and

•  the ability of Cascade’s board of directors to change its recommendation that Cascade shareholders vote to approve the

merger agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement (including the right of First
Interstate to match any competing bid and the payment of a termination fee).

Cascade’s board of directors also identified and considered a variety of uncertainties and risks concerning the merger, including,
but not limited to, the following:
 

 
•  the possibility that the merger may not be completed, or that its completion may be unduly delayed, for reasons beyond the

control of Cascade or First Interstate;
 

 
•  the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger, the potential length of the regulatory approval process and the

risks that the regulators could impose materially burdensome regulatory conditions that would allow either party to terminate
the merger agreement or refuse to complete the merger;

 

 

•  the time, attention and effort required from Cascade’s management and employees, and the risk of Cascade employee
attrition, during the period before the completion of the merger and the potential effect on Cascade’s and First Interstate’s
respective business and relationships with customers, service providers and other stakeholders, whether or not the merger is
completed;

 

 

•  the dual-class structure of First Interstate’s common stock, in which First Interstate Class A common stock is entitled to one
vote per share and First Interstate Class B common stock is entitled to five votes per share, including (1) the reduced voting
power Cascade shareholders will have in the combined company due to receiving shares of First Interstate Class A common
stock rather than First Interstate Class B common stock, (2) that First Interstate’s controlling shareholder group’s voting
interest in First Interstate is not proportionate to its economic interest in First Interstate, (3) that First Interstate Class A
common stock price likely reflects a discount due to the potential lack of availability of any control premium for such shares
if First Interstate were to be acquired and (4) that Cascade shareholders will be minority shareholders in the combined
company; however, First Interstate’s agreement to amend and restate its articles of incorporation to generally provide that the
holders of First Interstate Class A common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock will receive the same
consideration in mergers and other transactions and that such provision would not be changed except by a supermajority
vote, mitigates some of the concerns with First Interstate’s dual class structure;

 

 
•  the requirement that Cascade conduct its business in the ordinary course and the other restrictions on the conduct of

Cascade’s business before completion of the merger, which may delay or prevent Cascade from undertaking business
opportunities that may arise pending completion of the merger;

 

 
•  the potential that certain provisions of the merger agreement prohibiting Cascade from soliciting, and limiting its ability to

respond to, proposals for alternative transactions, and requiring the payment of a termination fee could have the effect of
discouraging an alternative proposal;

 

 
•  the transaction expenses that will be incurred in connection with the merger, including the costs of integrating the businesses

of Cascade and First Interstate;
 

 
•  the possible effects of the pendency or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including

any suit, action or proceeding initiated in respect of the merger;
 

 
•  the risk that benefits and synergies currently expected to result from the merger may not be realized or may not be realized

within the expected time period, and the risks associated with the integration of Cascade and First Interstate;
 

 
•  the lack of geographic overlap between Cascade and First Interstate, which may limit the combined company’s ability to

implement cost savings by eliminating branch locations and duplicate management and other employee positions;

•  the increased regulatory burden that will be imposed on the combined company due to its assets exceeding $10 billion

following the merger;
 

 
•  the stock portion of the merger consideration is a fixed exchange ratio of shares of Cascade common stock to First Interstate

Class A common stock; as a result, Cascade’s shareholders could be adversely affected by a decrease in the trading price of
First Interstate Class A common stock during the pendency of the merger; and

 

 •  the interests that certain officers and directors of Cascade have in the merger.

The foregoing discussion of information and factors considered by Cascade’s board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive.
In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger, Cascade’s board
of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in
reaching its determinations and recommendations. Moreover, each member of Cascade’s board of directors applied his or her own
personal business judgment to the process and may have given different weight to different factors than other members gave to such
factors.

Based on the factors described above, Cascade’s board of directors determined that the merger with First Interstate and the merger
of Cascade Bank with First Interstate Bank were advisable and in the best interests of Cascade shareholders and unanimously approved
the merger agreement.

Recommendation of Cascade’s Board of Directors

Cascade’s board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and unanimously
recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger agreement.

Opinion of Cascade’s Financial Advisor

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated October 14, 2016, Cascade’s board of directors engaged Piper Jaffray as financial advisor
to Cascade in connection with the merger with First Interstate. Piper Jaffray is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with
substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger and is familiar with Cascade and its business. As part of its investment
banking business, Piper Jaffray is routinely engaged in the valuation of financial services companies and their securities in connection
with mergers and acquisitions. The Piper Jaffray written opinion, dated November 16, 2016, is sometimes referred to in this section as
the “Piper Jaffray opinion.”

Piper Jaffray participated in certain of the negotiations leading to the execution of the merger agreement. At the meeting of the
board of directors of Cascade held on November 16, 2016, Piper Jaffray delivered to the board of directors its oral opinion, followed by
delivery of its written opinion, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the various factors, assumptions and limitations set
forth in its opinion, the merger consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Cascade common stock.

The full text of the Piper Jaffray opinion, which sets forth, among other things, the procedures followed, assumptions
made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken in rendering its opinion, is
attached as Annex C to this document and is incorporated by reference in this document. Piper Jaffray’s opinion speaks only as
of the date of the opinion. You are urged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety. Piper Jaffray’s opinion was addressed to,
and provided for the information and benefit of, Cascade’s board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its
evaluation of the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view, and did not address any other aspects or
implications of the merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to Cascade’s board of directors or to any other
persons in respect of the merger, including as to how any holder of Cascade common stock should vote at any Cascade special
meeting held

in connection with the merger, or to take, or not to take, any action in respect of the merger. Piper Jaffray’s opinion does not
address the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other business or financial strategies that might be available to
Cascade, nor does it address the underlying business decision of Cascade to engage in the merger. The issuance of the Piper
Jaffray opinion was approved by a fairness opinion committee of Piper Jaffray.

The summary of the opinion of Piper Jaffray set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion. Piper Jaffray has consented to the inclusion of this summary of its opinion in this document.

In rendering its opinion, Piper Jaffray, among other things:
 

 •  reviewed and analyzed the financial terms of a draft of the merger agreement dated as of November 15, 2016;
 

 
•  reviewed and analyzed certain financial and other data with respect to Cascade and First Interstate, which was publicly

available or made available to Piper Jaffray by Cascade or by First Interstate, that Piper Jaffray deemed relevant;
 

 

•  reviewed and analyzed certain forward-looking information relating to Cascade and First Interstate that was publicly
available, as well as that which was furnished to Piper Jaffray by Cascade and First Interstate, including Cascade’s internal
forecasts included in this document in the section entitled “—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information of Cascade and
First Interstate”;

 

 

•  reviewed and analyzed materials detailing the merger prepared by Cascade, First Interstate and their respective affiliates and
by their respective legal and accounting advisors, including the estimated amount and timing of the assumptions relating to
transaction expenses, regulatory costs, synergies and purchase accounting adjustments expected to result from the merger,
which we refer to as the “Synergies”;

 

 
•  reviewed the current and historical reported prices and trading activity of Cascade common stock and First Interstate Class A

common stock relative to the merger consideration and similar information for certain other publicly traded companies
deemed by Piper Jaffray to be comparable to Cascade and First Interstate;

 

 
•  compared the financial performance of Cascade and First Interstate with that of certain other publicly traded companies that

Piper Jaffray deemed relevant;
 

 
•  performed certain financial analyses for Cascade and First Interstate on a pro forma combined basis giving effect to the

merger based on assumptions relating to the Synergies, as provided by the management of First Interstate and approved by
Cascade;

 

 •  performed a discounted cash flow analysis for each of Cascade and First Interstate on a stand-alone basis;
 

 •  considered the current market environment generally and the community banking environment in particular;
 

 
•  reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain business combination transactions in the depository

banking industry that Piper Jaffray deemed relevant; and
 

 
•  conducted other analyses, examinations and inquiries and considered such other financial, economic and market criteria as

Piper Jaffray deemed necessary in arriving at its opinion.

Piper Jaffray also held several discussions with certain members of senior management and representatives of both Cascade and
First Interstate with respect to certain aspects of the merger, and the past and current

Table of Contents

business operations of Cascade and First Interstate, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of Cascade and First
Interstate, the effects of the merger on the financial condition and future prospects of First Interstate, and certain other matters Piper
Jaffray believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.

In arriving at its opinion, Piper Jaffray relied upon and assumed, without assuming liability or responsibility for independent
verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished, or otherwise made
available to, or discussed with or reviewed by Piper Jaffray. Piper Jaffray further relied upon the assurances of the management of
Cascade and First Interstate that the financial information provided was prepared on a reasonable basis in accordance with industry
practice, and that they are not aware of any information or facts that would make any information provided to Piper Jaffray incomplete
or misleading. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the purpose of its opinion, Piper Jaffray assumed that with respect
to financial forecasts, estimates and other forward-looking information (including the Synergies) reviewed by Piper Jaffray, that such
information was reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Cascade and First Interstate as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Cascade and First
Interstate, respectively, to which such financial forecasts, estimates and other forward-looking information (including the Synergies)
relate and Piper Jaffray assumed that such results would be achieved. Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion as to any such financial
forecasts, estimates or forward-looking information (including the Synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based.

Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion as to any of the legal, accounting and tax matters relating to the merger and any other
transactions contemplated in connection with the merger and relied, with Cascade’s consent, on the assumptions of the management of
Cascade and First Interstate, as to all accounting, legal, tax and financial reporting matters with respect to Cascade, First Interstate and
the merger agreement.

In arriving at its opinion, Piper Jaffray assumed that the executed merger agreement would be, in all material respects, identical to
the last draft reviewed by it. Piper Jaffray relied upon and assumed, with Cascade’s consent, without independent verification, that
(1) the representations and warranties of all parties to the merger agreement and all other related documents and instruments that are
referred to in the merger agreement are true and correct, (2) each party to such agreements will fully and timely perform all of the
covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party, (3) the merger will be consummated pursuant to the terms of the
merger agreement without any amendment thereto and (4) all conditions to the consummation of the merger will be satisfied without
waiver by any party of any condition or obligation thereunder.

Additionally, Piper Jaffray assumed that all the necessary regulatory approvals and consents required for the merger will be
obtained in a manner that would not adversely affect Cascade, First Interstate or the contemplated benefits of the merger.

Piper Jaffray did not perform any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or liabilities (fixed, contingent, derivative,
off-balance sheet, or other) of Cascade or First Interstate, and was not furnished or provided with any such appraisals or valuations, nor
did it evaluate the solvency of Cascade or First Interstate under any state or federal law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. Piper Jaffray also assumed in all respects material to its analysis that Cascade and First Interstate would remain as a going
concern for all periods relevant to its analysis. Accordingly, Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion regarding such valuations, or the
solvency or the liquidation value of Cascade, First Interstate or any other entity. Piper Jaffray assumed that there has been no material
change in the respective assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of Cascade or First Interstate since the
date of the most recent financial data made available to it. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Piper Jaffray did not:
(1) conduct a review of any individual credit files of Cascade or First Interstate, nor did it evaluate the adequacy of the loan or lease
reserves of Cascade or First Interstate, (2) conduct a review of any credit or loan marks or other mark-to-market adjustment that may
be taken in connection with the merger, nor did it evaluate the adequacy of any contemplated credit or loan marks to be so taken, or
(3) conduct a review of the collectability of any asset or the future performance of any

loan or other assets of Cascade or First Interstate. Piper Jaffray assumed, with Cascade’s consent, that the respective allowances for
loan and lease losses for Cascade and First Interstate, and the credit or loan marks are adequate to cover such losses and will be
adequate, without change, on a pro forma basis for First Interstate. Accordingly, Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion with respect to the
foregoing.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Piper Jaffray did not make any independent analysis of any pending or
threatened litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which Cascade or First Interstate is
a party or may be subject, and at the direction of Cascade and with Cascade’s consent, Piper Jaffray’s opinion makes no assumption
concerning, and therefore does not consider, the possible assertion of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters.
Piper Jaffray assumed, based on its discussions with management of Cascade and First Interstate, that none of Cascade, First Interstate,
nor any of their respective subsidiaries is party to any material pending transaction, including without limitation any financing,
recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the merger and the merger of the principal banking
subsidiaries of Cascade and First Interstate contemplated by the merger agreement.

No company or transaction used in any analysis for purposes of comparison is identical to Cascade, First Interstate or the merger.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the comparisons is not solely mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations and
judgments about differences in the companies and transactions to which Cascade, First Interstate and the merger were compared and
other factors that could affect the public trading value or transaction value of Cascade, First Interstate and the combined company or
the values in the transactions being compared.

Piper Jaffray’s opinion is necessarily based on current economic, market and other conditions and upon the information available
to Piper Jaffray and facts and circumstances as they existed and were subject to evaluation on the date of the Piper Jaffray opinion.
Events occurring after the date of the Piper Jaffray opinion could materially affect the assumptions used in preparing the opinion. Piper
Jaffray expressed no opinion as to the price at which shares of Cascade common stock or First Interstate Class A common stock may
trade following announcement or completion of the merger or at any future time. Piper Jaffray did not and does not have any obligation
to reaffirm or revise its opinion.

Piper Jaffray’s opinion does not address Cascade’s business decision to proceed with or effect the merger, the merits of the merger
relative to any alternative transaction or business strategy that may be available to Cascade, First Interstate’s ability to fund the cash
consideration, or any other term contemplated by the merger agreement or the fairness of the merger to holders of any other class of
Cascade securities, or to Cascade’s creditors or other constituencies. Furthermore, Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion with respect to
the amount or nature of compensation to any officer, director or employee of any party to the merger, or any class of such persons,
relative to the merger consideration to be received by holders of Cascade common stock in the merger or with respect to the fairness of
any such compensation, including whether such payments are reasonable in the context of the merger.

The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses. Accordingly, Piper Jaffray believes that its analyses and the summary of its analyses
must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in
tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create an incomplete or potentially misleading view of the process
underlying its analyses and opinion. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on
market data, is based on market data that existed on or before November 16, 2016 (the date of the Piper Jaffray opinion), and is not
necessarily indicative of market conditions.

Summary of Proposal. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share of Cascade
common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.14864 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock, plus $1.91 in cash,
without interest. Based on First Interstate’s closing price on November 15, 2016 of $38.05, the merger consideration was equivalent to
a price of $7.57 per share of Cascade common stock. Based on this deemed value per share to Cascade shareholders and assuming an
aggregate of 76,263,275 shares of Cascade common stock outstanding and 3,374,147 in-the-money options outstanding with a
weighted average exercise price of $4.80 per share, the aggregate merger consideration to holders of Cascade common stock and
options was approximately $586.3 million on November 15, 2016.

Transaction multiples for the merger were derived from a merger price of $7.57 per share for Cascade common stock based on
First Interstate Class A common stock closing price on November 15, 2016 of $38.05. For each precedent transaction, Piper Jaffray
derived and compared, among other things, the implied ratio of price per common share paid for the acquired company to:
 

 
•  book value per share of the acquired company based on the latest financial statements of the acquired company publicly

available before the announcement of the acquisition;
 

 
•  tangible book value per share of the acquired company based on the latest financial statements of the acquired company

publicly available before the announcement of the acquisition;
 

 
•  tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less jumbo time deposits and brokered deposits) based on the

financial statements of the acquired company publicly available before the announcement of the acquisition;
 

 
•  the last twelve months earnings per share based on the financial statements of the acquired company publicly available

before the announcement of the acquisition;
 

 •  the estimated current year and next year earnings per share of the acquired company based on time of announcement; and
 

 •  one-day premium to market price of the acquired company before the announcement of the transaction.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Piper Jaffray performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of Cascade
common stock assuming Cascade performed in accordance with internal financial projections for Cascade for the years ending
December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2020 as well as an estimated earnings growth rate for the two years thereafter, as provided
by the management of Cascade.

To approximate the terminal value of Cascade common stock at December 31, 2022, Piper Jaffray applied price to earnings
multiples of 11.0x to 15.0x. The terminal values were then discounted to present values using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to
13.0% when applied to 2022 earnings multiples, which were selected to reflect different assumptions regarding potential desired rates
of return of holders or prospective buyers of Cascade common stock. As illustrated in the following tables, the analysis indicates an
imputed range of values per share of Cascade common stock of $4.62 to $6.90 when applying multiples of earnings.

Piper Jaffray also considered how this analysis would be affected by changes in certain of the underlying assumptions, including
variations with respect to net income. To illustrate this effect, Piper Jaffray performed a similar analysis assuming Cascade’s net
income varied from 25.0% above projections to 25.0% below projections. This analysis resulted in the following range of per share
values for Cascade common stock, applying the transaction price to 2022 earnings multiples range of 11.0x to 15.0x referred to above
and using a discount rate of 10.5%.

Piper Jaffray also performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of First Interstate Class A common stock
assuming that First Interstate performed in accordance with publicly available consensus mean analyst earnings estimates through
December 31, 2020, as well as the mean consensus estimate growth rate for the two years thereafter, with the approval of the
management of Cascade. To approximate the terminal value of First Interstate Class A common stock at December 31, 2022, Piper
Jaffray applied price to earnings multiples ranging from 11.0x to 16.0x. The terminal values were then discounted to present values
using different discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 13.0% when applied to 2022 earnings, which were chosen to reflect different
assumptions regarding required rates of return holders or prospective buyers of First Interstate Class A common stock. As illustrated in
the following table, the analysis indicates an imputed range of values per share of First Interstate Class A common stock of $28.00 to
$44.18 when applying these earnings multiples.

In connection with its analyses, Piper Jaffray considered and discussed with Cascade’s management how the discounted cash flow
analyses would be affected by changes in the underlying assumptions. Piper Jaffray noted that the discounted cash flow analysis is a
widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent upon the numerous assumptions that
must be made, and the results are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results.

Financial Impact Analysis. Piper Jaffray analyzed certain potential pro forma effects of the merger, based on the following
assumptions: (1) the merger is completed in the second calendar quarter of 2017; (2) 100% of the outstanding shares of Cascade
common stock are converted into the right to receive 0.14864 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock, plus $1.91 in cash; and
(3) cash is paid to option and restricted stock unit holders and holders of restricted stock awards receive merger consideration pursuant
to the merger agreement. Piper Jaffray also incorporated certain assumptions as provided by First Interstate’s management, including

Table of Contents

certain pro forma assumptions relating to the Synergies. The analysis indicated that the merger (excluding transaction expenses) could
be dilutive to First Interstate’s estimated tangible book value per share at the completion of the merger and accretive to First Interstate’s
estimated earnings per share beginning in 2017.

In addition, Piper Jaffray analyzed certain potential pro forma effects of the transaction on First Interstate’s capital ratios given the
same assumptions set forth above. These analyses indicated that as of September 30, 2016, the transaction would result in First
Interstate’s regulatory capital ratios exceeding the minimum regulatory guidelines for “well-capitalized” status.

In connection with its pro forma analyses, Piper Jaffray considered and discussed with Cascade’s management how the analyses
would be affected by changes in the underlying assumptions, including the impact of final purchase accounting adjustments determined
at the closing of the transaction, and noted that the actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results
and that the variations may be material.

Piper Jaffray’s Compensation and Other Relationships with Cascade. Cascade and Piper Jaffray entered into an engagement letter
dated October 14, 2016 relating to the services to be provided by Piper Jaffray in connection with the merger. Pursuant to the
engagement letter, Cascade agreed to pay Piper Jaffray (a) a non-refundable retainer of $50,000, which will be credited against the
transaction fee; (b) a fee of $500,000 upon the delivery to Cascade’s board of directors of the written Piper Jaffray opinion, which fee
will be credited against the transaction fee; and (c) contingent upon the completion of the merger, a transaction fee equal to 1.0% of
aggregate transaction value. Cascade also agreed to reimburse Piper Jaffray for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements
incurred in connection with its engagement. Cascade has also agreed to indemnify Piper Jaffray against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

Other than Piper Jaffray’s engagement by Cascade in connection with the merger, Piper Jaffray or the lead banker on its current
deal team acted as financial advisor to Cascade in connection with (1) its April 2016 acquisition of Prime Pacific Financial Services,
Inc., (2) its May 2014 acquisition of Home Federal Bancorp and its (3) March 2016 acquisition of certain branches from Bank of
America, N.A. In the ordinary course of Piper Jaffray’s business as a broker-dealer, Piper Jaffray may, from time to time, purchase
securities from and sell securities to Cascade, First Interstate or their affiliates. Piper Jaffray may also actively trade the equity
securities of Cascade, First Interstate or their affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of its customers.

First Interstate’s Reasons for the Merger

First Interstate’s board of directors believes that the merger is in the best interests of First Interstate and its shareholders. In
deciding to approve the merger and the merger agreement, First Interstate’s board of directors considered a number of factors,
including:
 

 
•  Cascade’s community banking orientation, its favorable reputation within its local communities and its compatibility with

First Interstate and its subsidiaries;
 

 
•  First Interstate management’s review of the business, operations, earnings and financial condition, including asset quality, of

Cascade;
 

 
•  the scale, scope, strength and diversity of operations, product lines and delivery systems that could be achieved by

combining First Interstate and Cascade;
 

 
•  the benefits to the combined organization of the geographic diversity that would accompany First Interstate’s expansion into

new markets in Oregon, Idaho and Washington and the attractive demographics of such markets;
 

 •  First Interstate’s historic performance in similar markets;

Table of Contents

 
•  the expectation that the merger will create the opportunity for the combined company to have superior future earnings and

prospects compared to First Interstate’s earnings and prospects on a stand-alone basis;
 

 
•  First Interstate’s successful track record of creating shareholder value through merger and acquisition transactions, including

its proven experience in successfully integrating acquired businesses, and management’s belief that First Interstate will be
able to integrate Cascade with First Interstate successfully;

 

 
•  that the merger will result in a combined company with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, the costs

associated with passing that asset threshold and the related work that management of First Interstate has done to prepare for
the enhanced requirements relating to being a $10 billion institution;

the effect that, as of November 16, 2016, and based upon and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions stated
in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by First Interstate in the proposed merger was fair to First Interstate, from
a financial point of view (as more fully described above in the section entitled “— Opinion of First Interstate’s Financial
Advisor”);

 

 

•  the review by First Interstate’s board of directors with its management and legal advisors of the structure and other terms of
the merger and the expectation of First Interstate’s legal advisors that the merger will qualify as a transaction of a type that is
generally tax-free to Cascade shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes (except with respect to cash received in
exchange for their shares of Cascade common stock);

•  the risk that the conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the merger agreement may not be satisfied, including the

risk that necessary regulatory or shareholder approvals might not be obtained and, as a result, the merger may not be
consummated; and

 

 •  the other risks described in this document under the heading “Risk Factors.”

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by First Interstate’s board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by First Interstate’s board of directors. In reaching its decision to approve the
merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, First Interstate’s board of directors did
not quantify or assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to
different factors. First Interstate’s board of directors considered all these factors as a whole, including discussions with, and questioning
of First Interstate’s management and independent financial and legal advisors, and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and
to support, its determination.

Recommendation of First Interstate’s Board of Directors

First Interstate’s board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger and unanimously
recommends that First Interstate shareholders vote “FOR” the merger agreement.

Opinion of First Interstate’s Financial Advisor

First Interstate engaged Barclays to act as its financial advisor with respect to a possible purchase of Cascade, pursuant to an
engagement letter dated October 13, 2016. On November 16, 2016, Barclays rendered its oral opinion (which was subsequently
confirmed in writing) to First Interstate’s board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the qualifications,
limitations and assumptions stated in its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by First Interstate in the proposed merger was fair
to First Interstate, from a financial point of view.

The full text of Barclays’ written opinion, dated as of November 16, 2016, is attached as Annex B to this document.
Barclays’ written opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and
limitations upon the review undertaken by Barclays in rendering its opinion. You are encouraged to read the opinion carefully
in its entirety. The following is a summary of Barclays’ opinion and the methodology that Barclays used to render its opinion.
This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

Barclays’ opinion, the issuance of which was approved by Barclays’ Fairness Opinion Committee, is addressed to the board of
directors of First Interstate, addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be paid by First
Interstate in the proposed merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of First Interstate as to how such
shareholder should vote with respect to the proposed merger or any other matter. The terms of the proposed merger were determined
through arm’s-length negotiations between First Interstate and Cascade and were unanimously approved by the board of directors of
First Interstate and of Cascade. Barclays did not recommend any specific form of consideration to First Interstate or that any specific
form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the proposed merger. Barclays was not requested to address,
and its opinion does not in any manner address, First Interstate’s underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the proposed
merger, the likelihood of the consummation of the proposed merger, or the relative merits of the proposed merger as compared to any
other transaction or business strategy in which First Interstate may engage. In addition, Barclays expressed no opinion on, and its
opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the proposed merger to, or any consideration received in connection with the
proposed merger by, the holders of any class of securities or the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers, directors or
employees of any parties to the proposed merger, or any other class of persons, relative to the consideration to be paid in the proposed
merger or otherwise. No limitations were imposed by First Interstate’s board of directors upon Barclays with respect to the
investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Barclays, among other things:
 

 
•  reviewed and analyzed a draft of the merger agreement, dated as of November 17, 2016, that was provided to Barclays on

November 16, 2016, and the specific terms of the proposed merger;
 

 

•  reviewed and analyzed publicly available information concerning First Interstate and Cascade that Barclays believed to be
relevant to its analysis, including First Interstate’s and Cascade’s respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2016;

 

 

•  reviewed and analyzed published estimates by third party equity research analysts with respect to the future financial
performance of First Interstate and adjusted by management of First Interstate (as so adjusted, the “First Interstate Research
Estimates”) and generally available third party data regarding certain third party securities held and certificates of deposit
owed by Cascade;

 

 

•  reviewed and analyzed financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Cascade
furnished to Barclays by First Interstate, including financial projections of Cascade prepared by management of Cascade,
which we refer to in this document as the “Cascade Financial Projections,” and reviewed and adjusted by management of
First Interstate, which as so adjusted, we refer to in this document as the “First Interstate Cascade Projections,” both of
which are summarized below in the section titled “— Unaudited Prospective Financial Information;”

 

 

•  reviewed and analyzed certain financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of
First Interstate, including a presentation of the First Interstate Research Estimates on a pro forma basis giving effect to the
proposed merger prepared by management of First Interstate based on the First Interstate Research Estimates and the
Cascade Financial Projections, which we refer to in this document as the “Pro Forma Estimates;”

 

 
•  reviewed and analyzed the trading history of shares of First Interstate Class A common stock from November 11, 2015 to

November 11, 2016 and a trading history of Cascade common stock from November 11, 2015 to November 11, 2016;
 

 
•  reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of First Interstate and

Cascade with those of other companies that Barclays deemed relevant;
 

 
•  reviewed and analyzed a comparison of the financial terms of the proposed merger with the financial terms of certain other

recent transactions that Barclays deemed relevant;
 

 

•  reviewed and analyzed the pro forma impact of the proposed merger on the future financial performance of the combined
company, including cost savings, operating synergies and other financial implications expected by the management of First
Interstate to result from a combination of the businesses, which we refer to in this document collectively as the “Expected
Synergies;”

 

 
•  had discussions with the management of First Interstate concerning First Interstate’s and Cascade’s businesses, operations,

assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects; and
 

 •  undertook such other studies, analyses and investigations as Barclays deemed appropriate.

In arriving at its opinion, Barclays assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information
used by Barclays without any independent verification of such information (and did not assume responsibility or liability for any
independent verification of such information). Barclays also relied upon the assurances of management of First Interstate that they
were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. With respect to the First
Interstate Research Estimates, upon the advice and at the instruction of First Interstate, Barclays assumed that such estimates were a
reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial performance of First Interstate and that First Interstate would perform in
accordance with such estimates, and upon the advice and at the instruction of First Interstate, Barclays relied on such estimates in
performing its analysis and arriving at its opinion. With respect to the Cascade

Financial Projections, upon the advice and at the instruction of First Interstate, Barclays assumed that such projections had been
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Cascade as to the
future financial performance of Cascade and, upon the advice and at the instruction of First Interstate, Barclays assumed that the First
Interstate Cascade Projections were a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial performance of Cascade and that
Cascade would perform in accordance with such projections. Furthermore, upon the advice and at the instruction of First Interstate,
Barclays assumed that the amounts and timing of the Expected Synergies were reasonable and that the Expected Synergies would be
realized in accordance with such estimates. With respect to the Pro Forma Estimates, upon the advice and at the instruction of First
Interstate, Barclays assumed that such estimates were a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial performance of
First Interstate on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the proposed merger, that the pro forma adjustments to the First Interstate
Research Estimates were appropriate and that the pro forma company would perform in accordance with such Pro Forma Estimates.
Barclays assumed no responsibility for and it expressed no view as to any such projections, synergies or estimates or the assumptions
on which they are based. In addition, Barclays is not an expert in the evaluation of loan portfolios or assessing the adequacy of the
allowances for losses with respect thereto. Barclays made no analyses of, and expressed no opinion as to, such loan portfolios, First
Interstate’s review of such portfolios or Cascade’s allowances for loan losses and, upon the advice and at the instruction of First
Interstate, Barclays assumed that the respective current allowances for loan losses and capital of First Interstate and Cascade will be, in
each case and in the aggregate, including on a pro forma basis, adequate to cover all such losses. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did
not conduct a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of First Interstate or Cascade and did not make or obtain any
evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of First Interstate or Cascade, including with respect to their loan portfolios.
Barclays’ opinion necessarily is based upon market, economic and other conditions as they existed on and could be evaluated as of
November 16, 2016, the date of the opinion. Barclays assumes no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on events or
circumstances that might occur after the date of its opinion. Barclays expresses no opinion as to the prices at which shares of Cascade
common stock would trade following the announcement of the proposed merger or shares of First Interstate Class A common stock
would trade following the announcement or consummation of the proposed merger.

Barclays assumed that the executed merger agreement would conform in all material respects to the last draft reviewed by
Barclays. In addition, Barclays assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and all
the agreements related thereto. Barclays also assumed, upon the advice of and at the instruction of First Interstate, that all material
governmental, regulatory and third party approvals, consents and releases for the proposed merger would be obtained within the
constraints contemplated by the merger agreement and that the proposed merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms
of the merger agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof. Barclays
did not express any opinion as to the differential voting or other rights between the shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and
First Interstate Class B common stock or the potential consequences of the amendments to First Interstate’s articles of incorporation
contemplated by the Agreement, including any changes to the terms of the shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and First
Interstate Class B common stock pursuant to the amendments. Barclays also did not express any opinion as to any tax or other
consequences that might result from the proposed merger, nor did Barclays’ opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting
matters, as to which Barclays understood First Interstate had obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Barclays performed certain financial, comparative and other analyses as summarized
below. In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not ascribe a specific range of values to the shares of First Interstate Class A common
stock, to shares of First Interstate Class B common stock or shares of Cascade common stock but rather made its determination as to
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be paid by First Interstate in the proposed merger on the basis of
various financial and comparative analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative analyses and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.

In arriving at its opinion, Barclays did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor considered by it but
rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all other analyses and
factors performed and considered by it and in the context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, Barclays
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole, as considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering
all analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses used by Barclays in preparing its opinion to First Interstate’s board
of directors. Certain financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. To fully understand the
financial analyses used by Barclays, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. In performing its analyses, Barclays made numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
First Interstate or Cascade. None of First Interstate, Cascade, Barclays or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are
materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or
predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses
relating to the value of the businesses do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which the businesses may actually be sold.

Selected Comparable Company Analysis

To assess how the public market values shares of similar publicly traded companies and to provide a range of relative implied
equity values per share of First Interstate Class A common stock and per share of Cascade common stock by reference to those
companies, which could then be used to calculate implied exchange ratio ranges, Barclays reviewed and compared specific financial
and operating data relating to First Interstate and Cascade with selected companies that Barclays, based on its experience in the
financial institutions and banking industry, deemed comparable to First Interstate and Cascade. The selected comparable companies
with respect to First Interstate were:
 

 
Barclays calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios of First Interstate and its selected comparable companies.

As part of its selected comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated and analyzed ratios of current stock prices per share to
calendar year 2017 and 2018 estimated earnings per share, which we refer to in this document as “EPS” and which is commonly
referred to as the price earnings ratio, or P/E multiple. Also, as part of its selected comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated
and analyzed ratios of current stock prices per share to September 30, 2016 tangible book value, which we refer to in this document as
“TBV.”

Finally, as part of its selected comparable company analysis, Barclays calculated and analyzed premiums of current stock prices per
share in excess of TBV per share divided by September 30, 2016 core deposits, which we refer to in this document as “CDP.” All of
the calculations for First Interstate were performed with and based on the First Interstate Research Estimates or publicly available
historical financials and the trading price of per share of First Interstate Class A common stock. All of the calculations for the selected
comparable companies were performed with and based on publicly available financial data as of September 30, 2016 or as of the most
recent quarter available and closing prices as of November 11, 2016. The results of this selected comparable company analysis for First

Barclays selected the comparable companies listed above because of similarities in one or more business or operating
characteristics with First Interstate or Cascade, respectively. However, because of the inherent differences between the business,
operations and prospects of First Interstate or Cascade, respectively, and those of their respective selected comparable companies,
Barclays believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected comparable
company analysis. Accordingly, Barclays also made qualitative judgments concerning differences between the business, financial and
operating characteristics and prospects of First Interstate, Cascade and their respective selected comparable companies that could affect
the public trading values of each company’s publicly traded stock to provide a context in which to consider the results of the
quantitative analysis. These qualitative judgments related primarily to the differing sizes, growth prospects, profitability levels and
degree of operational risk between First Interstate, Cascade and the companies included in the respective selected company analysis.

First Interstate Standalone Valuation. Based upon its professional judgments, Barclays selected a range of calendar year 2017 P/E
multiples of 14.0x to 19.1x and calendar year 2018 P/E multiples of 12.5x to 17.6x for First Interstate, based on the top and bottom
quartile of selected comparable companies. Barclays applied this range to First Interstate’s projected calendar year 2017 and 2018
estimated EPS, as set out in the First Interstate Research Estimates, to calculate a range of implied values per share of First Interstate
Class A common stock. These calculations resulted in a range of implied values per share of First Interstate Class A common stock of
$32.56 to $44.55 based on 2017 P/E multiples, which we refer to in this document as the “First Interstate 2017E P/E Range” and
$30.75 to $43.09 based on 2018 P/E multiples, which we refer to in this document as the “First Interstate 2018E P/E Range.”

Based upon its professional judgments, Barclays also selected a range of TBV multiples of 1.60x to 2.37x for shares of First
Interstate Class A common stock, based on the top and bottom quartile of selected comparable companies. Barclays applied this range
to First Interstate’s September 30, 2016 TBV to calculate a range of implied values per share of First Interstate Class A common stock.
These calculations resulted in a range of implied values per share of First Interstate Class A common stock of $27.03 to $40.04.

Based upon its professional judgments, Barclays also selected a range of CDPs of 8.7% to 16.6% for shares of First Interstate
Class A common stock, based on the top and bottom quartile of selected comparable companies. Barclays applied this range to First
Interstate’s September 30, 2016 CDPs to calculate a range of implied values per share of First Interstate Class A common stock. These
calculations resulted in a range of implied values per share of First Interstate Class A common stock of $30.18 to $42.26.

Cascade Standalone Valuation. Based upon its professional judgments, Barclays selected a range of calendar year 2017 P/E
multiples of 14.6x to 16.3x for Cascade, based on the top and bottom quartile of selected comparable companies. Barclays applied this
range to Cascade’s projected calendar year 2017 estimated EPS, as set out in the First Interstate Cascade Projections, to calculate a
range of implied values per share of Cascade common stock. These calculations resulted in a range of implied values per share of
Cascade common stock of $5.49 to $6.16 based on 2017 P/E multiples. Barclays then applied fully-phased in cost savings of
approximately $24.7 million (pre-tax), based on First Interstate’s estimates of Cascade’s run-rate non-interest expense, which we refer
to in this document as the “Cost Savings,” to such range to calculate a range of implied values per share of Cascade common stock of
$8.56 to $9.60 based on 2017 P/E multiples, which we refer to in this document as the “Cascade 2017E P/E Range with Cost Savings.”

Based upon its professional judgments, Barclays also selected a range of TBV multiples of 1.34x to 1.86x for Cascade, based on
the top and bottom quartile of selected comparable companies. Barclays applied this range to Cascade’s September 30, 2016 TBV to
calculate a range of implied values per share of Cascade common stock. These calculations resulted in a range of implied values per
share of Cascade common stock of $4.74 to $6.58.

Based upon its professional judgments, Barclays also selected a range of CDPs of 5.6% to 10.7% for Cascade, based on the top
and bottom quartile of selected comparable companies. Barclays applied this range to

Cascade’s September 30, 2016 CDPs to calculate a range of implied values per share of Cascade common stock. These calculations
resulted in a range of implied values per share of Cascade common stock of $5.48 to $7.24.

Implied Exchange Ratio. After determining the ranges of implied equity values per share of First Interstate Class A common stock
and Cascade common stock calculated using the comparable companies analyses summarized above, Barclays deducted the cash
consideration per share of Cascade common stock to calculate ranges of implied exchange ratios. Barclays calculated the low end of
the calendar year 2017E P/E implied exchange ratio range by dividing the low end of the Cascade 2017E P/E Range with Cost Savings,
less the amount of cash consideration per share of Cascade common stock, by the high end of the First Interstate 2017E P/E Range, and
Barclays calculated the high end of the calendar year 2017E P/E implied exchange ratio range by dividing the high end of the Cascade
2017E P/E Range with Cost Savings, less the amount of cash consideration per share of Cascade common stock, by the low end of the
First Interstate 2017E P/E Range. These calculations resulted in a range of implied exchange ratios of 0.14935x to 0.23605x. Barclays
calculated the low end of the calendar year 2018E P/E exchange ratio range by dividing the low end of the Cascade 2018E P/E Range
with Cost Savings, less the amount of cash consideration per share of Cascade common stock, by the high end of the First Interstate
2018E P/E Range, and Barclays calculated the high end of the calendar year 2018E P/E exchange ratio range by dividing the high end
of the Cascade 2018E P/E Range with Cost Savings, less the amount of cash consideration per share of Cascade common stock, by the
low end of the First Interstate 2018E P/E Range. These calculations resulted in a range of implied exchange ratios of 0.15044x to
0.23782x.

The following summarizes the result of these calculations:
 

   
Range of Implied
Exchange Ratios  

   Low        High  
Calendar Year 2017E P/E    0.14935x    -    0.23605x 
Calendar Year 2018E P/E    0.15044x    -    0.23782x 

Selected Precedent Transaction Analysis

Barclays reviewed and compared the purchase prices and financial multiples paid in selected recent transactions that Barclays,
based on its experience with merger and acquisition transactions, deemed relevant. Barclays chose such transactions based on, among
other things, the similarity of the applicable target companies in the transactions to Cascade with respect to the business strategy and
other financial and operating characteristics of their businesses.

The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected precedent transactions analyzed were diverse and there
are inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of First Interstate, Cascade and the companies
included in the selected precedent transaction analysis. Accordingly, Barclays believed that a purely quantitative selected precedent
transaction analysis would not be particularly meaningful in the context of considering the proposed merger. Barclays therefore made
qualitative judgments concerning differences between the characteristics of the selected recent precedent transactions and the proposed
merger that would affect the acquisition values of the selected target companies and Cascade.

Barclays examined the following community bank transactions:
 

Announcement Date   Acquiror   Target
4/28/16   Mechanics Bank   California Republic Bancorp
3/9/15   Western Alliance Bancorporation   Bridge Capital Holdings

Based upon its professional judgments, Barclays selected a range of next twelve month, which we refer to in this document as
“NTM,” EPS plus Cost Savings multiples of 11.9x to 13.5x for Cascade, based on the top and bottom quartile of selected precedent
transactions. Barclays applied this range to Cascade’s estimated NTM EPS, as set out in the First Interstate Cascade Projections plus
Cost Savings to calculate a range of implied values of Cascade. These calculations resulted in a range of implied values per share of
Cascade common stock of $6.91 to $7.81.

Based upon its professional judgments, Barclays selected a range of adjusted TBV multiples of 1.81x to 2.13x for Cascade, based
on the top and bottom quartile of selected precedent transactions. Barclays applied this range to Cascade’s TBV at September 30, 2016,
adjusted to exclude capital in excess of an 8% ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets to calculate a range of implied values
of Cascade. These calculations resulted in a range of implied values per share of Cascade common stock of $6.12 to $7.15.

Based upon its professional judgments, Barclays selected a range of adjusted CDPs of 7.8% to 14.2% for Cascade, based on the
top and bottom quartile of selected precedent transactions. Barclays applied this range to Cascade’s CDPs at September 30, 2016 to
calculate a range of implied values of Cascade. These calculations resulted in a range of implied values per share of Cascade common
stock of $6.24 to $8.45.

Dividend Discount Analysis

As a further analysis in estimating the present value of shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and Cascade common
stock, Barclays performed a dividend discount analysis of shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and Cascade common stock.
A dividend discount analysis is a valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an entity by adding the estimated dividends
expected to be paid to shareholders through a specified forecast period, in this case, December 31, 2021, to the residual value of the
entity at the end of the forecast period, which we refer to in this document, as applied to First Interstate for the forecast period ending
December 31, 2021, as the “terminal value of First Interstate” as of December 31, 2021. This sum is then discounted to its “present
value” using a range of selected discount rates. “Present value” refers to the current value of future cash flows or amounts and is
obtained by discounting those future cash flows or amounts to a specified date, in this case, September 30, 2016, by a discount rate that
takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other
appropriate factors. In connection with this analysis, Barclays assumed an annual dividend payout of tangible common equity in excess
of an 8% ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets.

First Interstate Standalone Valuation. To calculate the estimated value of First Interstate Class A common stock using the
dividend discount analysis method, Barclays added (1) projected dividends on shares of First Interstate Class A common stock through
December 31, 2021 based on the First Interstate Research Estimates to (2) the terminal value of First Interstate as of December 31,
2021, and discounted such amount to September 30, 2016 using a range of selected discount rates. The terminal value of First Interstate
was estimated by applying a range of terminal value multiples of 14.0x to 17.0x, which was derived by analyzing the results from the
First Interstate selected comparable company analysis and applying such range to the First Interstate Research Estimates. The range of
“cost of equity” discount rates of 10.0% to 13.0% was selected based on a capital asset pricing model of companies included in First
Interstate’s selected comparable company analysis. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of First Interstate
Class A common stock by dividing the value derived from the dividend discount method by the fully diluted number of shares of First
Interstate Class A common stock as provided by First Interstate management. These calculations resulted in a range of implied values
per share of First Interstate Class A common stock of $32.40 to $42.73, which we refer to in this document as the “First Interstate DCF
Range.”

Cascade Standalone Valuation. To calculate the estimated value of Cascade common stock using the dividend discount analysis
method, Barclays added (1) projected dividends on shares of Cascade common stock through December 31, 2021 based on the First
Interstate Cascade Projections as adjusted by First Interstate

management for Cost Savings and other financial implications of the proposed business combination to (2) the residual value of
Cascade at the end of the forecast period, which we refer to in this document as the “terminal value of Cascade,” as of December 31,
2021 as adjusted by First Interstate management for Cost Savings and other financial implications of the proposed business
combination, and discounted such amounts to their present value using a range of selected discount rates. The terminal value of
Cascade was estimated by applying a range of terminal value multiples of 14.0x to 16.0x, which was derived by analyzing the results
from the Cascade selected comparable company analysis and applying such range to the First Interstate Cascade Projections as adjusted
by First Interstate management for Cost Savings and other financial implications of the proposed business combination. The range of
“cost of equity” discount rates of 9.0% to 12.0% was selected based on a capital asset pricing model of companies included in
Cascade’s selected comparable company analysis. Barclays then calculated a range of implied prices per share of Cascade common
stock by dividing the value derived from the dividend discount method by the fully diluted number of shares of Cascade common stock
as provided by Cascade management. These calculations resulted in a range of implied equity values per share of Cascade common
stock of $7.11 to 9.07 based on First Interstate Cascade Projections as adjusted by First Interstate management for Cost Savings and
other financial implications of the proposed business combination, which we refer to in this document as the “Cascade DCF Range
with Cost Savings.”

Implied Exchange Ratio. Using the ranges of implied values per share of First Interstate Class A common stock and Cascade
common stock calculated using the dividend discount method analyses summarized above, Barclays calculated ranges of implied
exchange ratios for shares of Cascade common stock. Barclays calculated the low end of the Cascade DCF implied exchange ratio
range by dividing the low end of the Cascade DCF Range with Cost Savings, less the amount of cash consideration per share of
Cascade common stock, by the high end of the First Interstate DCF Range, and Barclays calculated the high end of the Cascade DCF
implied exchange ratio range by dividing the high end of the Cascade DCF Range with Cost Savings, less the amount of cash
consideration per share of Cascade common stock, by the low end of the First Interstate DCF Range. These calculations resulted in a
range of implied exchange ratios of 0.12169x to 0.22099x.

General

Barclays is an internationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking activities, is regularly
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and
control purposes, negotiated underwritings, competitive bids, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. First Interstate’s board of directors selected Barclays because of its
familiarity with First Interstate and its qualifications, reputation and experience in the valuation of businesses and securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions generally.

Barclays is acting as financial advisor to First Interstate in connection with the proposed merger. As compensation for its services
in connection with the proposed merger, First Interstate paid Barclays $1.0 million upon the delivery of Barclays’ opinion, which we
refer to in this document as the “Opinion Fee” and that became payable upon the delivery of Barclays’ opinion. The Opinion Fee was
not contingent upon the conclusion of Barclays’ opinion or the consummation of the proposed merger. Additional compensation of
$4.5 million will be payable on completion of the proposed merger against which the amounts paid for the opinion will be credited. In
addition, First Interstate has agreed to reimburse Barclays for expenses incurred in connection with the proposed merger and to
indemnify Barclays for certain liabilities that may arise out of its engagement by First Interstate and the rendering of Barclays’ opinion.
Barclays has performed various investment banking and financial services for First Interstate and its affiliates in the past, and it expects
to perform such services in the future, and expects to receive customary fees for such services.

In addition, Barclays and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, or in the future may provide, investment
banking services to certain significant shareholders of Cascade, which we refer to in this document as the “Sponsors,” and certain of
their affiliates and portfolio companies and have received or in the

future may receive customary fees for rendering such services, including (1) having acted or acting as financial advisor to Sponsors and
certain of their portfolio companies and affiliates in connection with certain mergers and acquisition transactions; (2) having acted or
acting as arranger, bookrunner and/or lender for Sponsors and certain of their portfolio companies and affiliates in connection with the
financing for various acquisition transactions; and (3) having acted or acting as underwriter, initial purchaser and placement agent for
various equity and debt offerings undertaking by Sponsors and certain of their portfolio companies and affiliates.

Barclays and its affiliates engage in a wide range of businesses from investment and commercial banking, lending, asset
management and other financial and non-financial services. In the ordinary course of its business, Barclays and its affiliates may
actively trade and effect transactions in the equity, debt and/or other securities (and any derivatives thereof) and financial instruments
(including loans and other obligations) of First Interstate and Cascade for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions and investments in such securities and financial instruments.

Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

Neither First Interstate nor Cascade as a matter of course makes public projections as to future performance, revenues, earnings or
other financial results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, First
Interstate and Cascade are each including in this document certain unaudited prospective financial information that was made available
to Cascade and its financial advisor or to First Interstate and its financial advisor in connection with the merger. The inclusion of this
information should not be regarded as an indication that any of Cascade, First Interstate, Piper Jaffray or Barclays, their respective
representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future
results, or that it should be construed as financial guidance, and it should not be relied on as such. First Interstate’s management
approved the use of the First Interstate Cascade Projections and Cascade’s management approved the use of the following unaudited
prospective financial information concerning Cascade. This information was prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many
respects. While presented with numeric specificity, the unaudited prospective financial information reflects numerous estimates and
assumptions made with respect to business, economic, market, competition, regulatory and financial conditions and matters specific to
Cascade’s business, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond each Cascade’s control. The unaudited
prospective financial information reflects both assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and, in many
respects, subjective judgment, and thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and
business developments. No assurance can be given that the unaudited prospective financial information and the underlying estimates
and assumptions will be realized. In addition, since the unaudited prospective financial information covers multiple years, such
information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth
below, and important factors that may affect actual results and cause the unaudited prospective financial information to be inaccurate
include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Cascade’s business, industry performance, general business and
economic conditions, customer requirements, competition and adverse changes in applicable laws, regulations or rules. For other
factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Caution About Forward-Looking
Statements” beginning on pages 16 and 22, respectively, of this document.

The unaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor was it prepared with
a view toward compliance with generally accepted accounting principles, published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. In
addition, the unaudited prospective financial information requires significant estimates and assumptions that make it inherently less
comparable to the similarly titled generally accepted accounting principles measures in each party’s historical generally accepted
accounting principles financial statements. Neither First Interstate’s nor Cascade’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor
any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the unaudited prospective
financial information contained in this document, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such
information or its achievability.

Furthermore, the unaudited prospective financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring
after the date it was prepared. No assurance can be given that, had the unaudited prospective financial information been prepared either
as of the date of the merger agreement or as of the date of this document, similar estimates and assumptions would be used. Neither
First Interstate nor Cascade intends to, and each party disclaims any obligation to, make publicly available any update or other revision
to the unaudited prospective financial information to reflect circumstances existing since their preparation or to reflect the occurrence
of unanticipated events, even if any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error, or to reflect changes in general
economic or industry conditions. The unaudited prospective financial information does not take into account the possible financial and
other effects on either Cascade or First Interstate, as applicable, of the merger and does not attempt to predict or suggest future results
of the combined company after giving effect to the merger. The unaudited prospective financial information does not give effect to the
merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with
completing the merger, the potential synergies that may be achieved by the combined company as a result of the merger, the effect on
either Cascade or First Interstate, as applicable, of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result
of the merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have
been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but that were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in
anticipation of the merger. Further, the unaudited prospective financial information does not take into account the effect on either
Cascade or First Interstate, as applicable, of any possible failure of the merger to occur. None of Cascade, First Interstate, Piper Jaffray,
Barclays or their respective affiliates, associates, officers, directors, advisors, agents or other representatives has made, makes or is
authorized in the future to make any representation to any shareholder of Cascade, shareholder of First Interstate or any other person
regarding Cascade’s ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the unaudited prospective financial information or
that the projected results will be achieved.

In light of the foregoing, and considering that the shareholder meetings of First Interstate’s and Cascade’s shareholders will be
held many months after the unaudited prospective financial information was prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any
forecasted information, shareholders are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on such information, and First Interstate and
Cascade urge all shareholders to review First Interstate’s and Cascade’s financial statements and other information contained elsewhere
in this document for a description of First Interstate’s and Cascade’s respective businesses and reported financial results.

Cascade Stock Options, Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units

At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase shares of Cascade common stock outstanding immediately before the
effective time of the merger, whether or not vested, will be cancelled and, upon First Interstate’s receipt of an option surrender
agreement from the holder, exchanged for a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Cascade common stock
subject to the stock option multiplied by (2) the amount by which the merger consideration exceeds the exercise price of such option,
less applicable withholding taxes. For purposes of this calculation, the merger consideration is the sum of the cash consideration and
the product of the exchange ratio times the average closing sales price of First Interstate Class A common stock over the 20
consecutive trading days ending on the fifth day before the closing date of the merger. Assuming a stock price of $38.50, which was the
closing price of First Interstate Class A common stock on April 5, 2017, the most recent practicable date before the mailing of this
document, the aggregate cash amount payable to the holders of Cascade stock options was $9.5 million.

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of restricted stock will vest and be converted into the right to receive
0.14864 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and $1.91 in cash, without interest.

At the effective time of the merger, each Cascade restricted stock unit outstanding immediately before the effective time of the
merger, whether or not vested, will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of
Cascade common stock subject to the restricted stock unit multiplied by (2) the merger consideration, less applicable withholding
taxes. For purposes of this calculation, the merger consideration is the sum of the cash consideration and the product of the exchange
ratio times the average closing sales price of First Interstate Class A common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the
fifth day before the closing date of the merger. Assuming a stock price of $38.50, which was the closing price of First Interstate
Class A common stock on April 5, 2017, the most recent practicable date before the mailing of this document, the aggregate cash
amount payable to the holders of Cascade restricted stock units was $437,138.

Surrender of Stock Certificates

The conversion of Cascade common stock into the right to receive the merger consideration will occur automatically at the
effective time of the merger. As promptly as practicable after the completion of the merger, but in no event later than ten days
thereafter, the exchange agent will mail to Cascade shareholders a letter of transmittal, together with instructions for the exchange of
their Cascade common stock certificates for the merger consideration. Until you surrender your Cascade stock certificates for exchange
after completion of the merger, you will not be paid dividends or other distributions declared after the merger with respect to any First
Interstate Class A common stock into which your Cascade shares have been converted. When you surrender your Cascade stock
certificates accompanied by a properly completed letter of transmittal, First Interstate will pay any unpaid dividends or other
distributions, without interest, that had become payable with respect to the shares of First Interstate Class A common stock into which
your Cascade shares had been converted.

Table of Contents

If you own shares of Cascade common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should receive or
seek instructions from the broker, bank or other nominee holding your shares concerning how to surrender your shares of Cascade
common stock in exchange for the merger consideration.

If your Cascade stock certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, you will have to provide an affidavit claiming your Cascade
stock certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by First Interstate, post a bond in such amount as the exchange agent
may direct before you receive any consideration for your shares.

After the completion of the merger, there will be no further transfers of Cascade common stock. Cascade stock certificates
presented for transfer after the completion of the merger will be canceled and exchanged for the merger consideration.

Accounting Treatment

First Interstate will account for the merger under the “acquisition” method of accounting according to U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Using the acquisition method of accounting, the assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities of
Cascade will be recorded by First Interstate at their respective fair values at the time of the completion of the merger. The excess of
First Interstate’s purchase price over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will then be recorded as goodwill.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequence of the Merger

General. The following summary discusses the material anticipated U.S. federal income tax consequence of the merger
applicable to a holder of shares of Cascade common stock who surrenders all of his or her common stock for shares of First Interstate
Class A common stock and cash in the merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations, judicial
authorities, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer in this document as the “IRS, and other applicable
authorities, all as in effect on the date of this document and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations (possibly with
retroactive effect). This discussion is limited to U.S. residents and citizens who hold their shares as capital assets for U.S. federal
income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code (generally, assets held for investment). No
attempt has been made to comment on all U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger and related transactions that may be
relevant to holders of shares of Cascade common stock. This discussion also does not address all of the tax consequences that may be
relevant to a particular person or the tax consequences that may be relevant to persons subject to special treatment under U.S. federal
income tax laws (including, among others, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or foreign currencies, banks, insurance
companies, financial institutions or persons who hold their shares of Cascade common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive
sale or conversion transaction, persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons that are, or hold their shares of
Cascade common stock through, partnerships or other pass-through entities, or persons who acquired their shares of Cascade common
stock through the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation). In addition, this discussion does not address the
alternative minimum tax, the unearned income Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or any aspects of state, local,
non-U.S. taxation or U.S. federal taxation other than income taxation. No ruling has been requested from the IRS regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the merger. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not
sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences set forth below.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Cascade common stock that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, (1) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a corporation, or entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District
of Columbia, (3) a trust if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust
and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) such trust was in existence on

August 20, 1996, was treated as a U.S. person under the Internal Revenue Code on the previous day and made a valid election to be
treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (4) an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, regardless of its source.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a holder of Cascade common stock, the
tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any
entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is a holder of Cascade common stock, and any partners in such
partnership, should consult their own independent tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the merger to their specific
circumstances.

Determining the actual tax consequences of the merger to you may be complex and will depend on your specific situation
and on factors that are not within First Interstate’s or Cascade’s control. You should consult your own independent tax advisor
as to the specific tax consequences of the merger in your particular circumstances, including the applicability and effect of the
alternative minimum tax and any state, local, foreign and other tax laws and of changes in those laws.

Opinion Conditions. It is a condition to the obligations of First Interstate and Cascade that they each receive an opinion from
their respective legal counsel to the effect that the merger will constitute a “reorganization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and that each of First Interstate and Cascade will be a party to the
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. First Interstate and Cascade expect to be able to
obtain the tax opinion if, as expected:
 

 •  First Interstate and Cascade are able to deliver customary representations to their respective legal counsel; and
 

 •  there is no adverse change in U.S. federal income tax law.

Although the merger agreement allows both First Interstate and Cascade to waive the condition that a tax opinion be delivered,
neither party currently anticipates doing so.

In addition, in connection with the filing of the registration statement of which this document forms a part, Luse Gorman and
Hunton has each delivered its opinion to First Interstate and Cascade, respectively, that the merger will qualify as a “reorganization”
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and confirming the tax discussion under “Description of the
Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequence of the Merger.” Copies of these opinions have been filed as exhibits to the
registration statement. Such opinions have been rendered on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to
in such opinions and factual representations contained in certificates of officers of First Interstate and Cascade, all of which must
continue to be true and accurate in all material respects as of the effective time of the merger. The opinions of Luse Gorman and
Hunton are not binding on the IRS or any court.

If any of the representations or assumptions upon which the opinions are based are inconsistent with the actual facts, the tax
consequences of the merger could be adversely affected. The determination by tax counsel as to whether the proposed merger will be
treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code will depend upon the facts and law
existing at the effective time of the proposed merger.

Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders. Based on the opinions that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to a U.S. holder are as
follows:
 

 

•  you will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount by which the sum of the fair market
value of the First Interstate Class A common stock and cash you receive exceeds your tax basis in your Cascade common
stock, and (2) the amount of cash you receive (in each case excluding any cash received instead of fractional shares of First
Interstate Class A common stock, which will be treated as discussed below);

Table of Contents

 

•  the aggregate tax basis of the First Interstate Class A common stock that you receive in the merger (including, for this
purpose, any fractional shares deemed received and redeemed for cash as described below) will equal your aggregate
adjusted tax basis in the shares of Cascade common stock you surrender in the merger, decreased by the amount of cash you
receive in the merger (excluding any cash received instead of a fractional share of First Interstate Class A common stock),
and increased by the amount of gain you recognize on the exchange (including any portion of the gain that is classified as
capital gain or dividend income and excluding any gain recognized as a result of cash received instead of a fractional shares
of First Interstate Class A common stock, all as described below); and

 

 
•  the holding period for the shares of First Interstate Class A common stock that you receive in the merger (including any

fractional share deemed received and redeemed for cash as described below) will include your holding period of the shares
of Cascade common stock that you surrender in the merger.

If you acquired different blocks of Cascade common stock at different times or at different prices, the First Interstate Class A
common stock you receive will be allocated pro rata to each block of Cascade common stock, and the basis and holding period of each
block of First Interstate Class A common stock you receive will be determined on a block-for-block basis depending on the basis and
holding period of the blocks of Cascade common stock exchanged for such block of First Interstate Class A common stock.

Gain that you recognize in connection with the merger generally will constitute capital gain and will constitute long-term capital
gain if you have held your Cascade common stock for more than one year as of the date of the merger. Long-term capital gains of
certain non-corporate holders of Cascade common stock, including individuals, are generally taxed at preferential rates. In some cases,
if a holder actually or constructively owns First Interstate Class A common stock other than First Interstate Class A common stock
received pursuant to the merger, the recognized gain could be treated as having the effect of a distribution of a dividend under the tests
set forth in Section 302 of the Internal Revenue Code, in which case such gain would be treated as dividend income. Because the
possibility of dividend treatment depends upon each holder’s particular circumstances, including the application of constructive
ownership rules, you should consult your tax advisor regarding the application of the foregoing rules to your particular circumstances.

If you receive cash instead of a fractional share of First Interstate Class A common stock, you generally will be treated as having
received such fractional share of First Interstate Class A common stock pursuant to the merger and then as having sold such fractional
share of First Interstate Class A common stock for cash. As a result, you generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount of cash received and the tax basis in your fractional share of First Interstate Class A common stock as set forth
above. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the effective date of
the merger, the holding period for such fractional share (including the holding period of shares of Cascade common stock surrendered
therefor) exceeds one year. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders of Cascade common stock, including individuals,
are generally taxed at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Backup Withholding. Unless an exemption applies under the backup withholding rules of Section 3406 of the Internal Revenue
Code, the exchange agent will be required to, and will, withhold 28% of any cash payments to which a Cascade shareholder is entitled
pursuant to the merger, unless the Cascade shareholder signs the substitute IRS Form W-9 enclosed with the letter of transmittal sent by
the exchange agent. Unless an applicable exemption exists and is proved in a manner satisfactory to the exchange agent, this completed
form provides the information, including the Cascade shareholder’s taxpayer identification number, and certification necessary to avoid
backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional tax and will be allowed as a refund
or credit against your U.S. Federal income tax liability, provided you timely furnish the required information to the IRS.

Table of Contents

Tax Treatment of the Entities. No gain or loss will be recognized by First Interstate or Cascade as a result of the merger.

Reporting Requirements. A holder of Cascade common stock that receives First Interstate Class A common stock as a result of
the merger will be required to retain certain records pertaining to the merger. Each holder of Cascade common stock who is required to
file a U.S. tax return and who is a “significant holder” that receives First Interstate Class A common stock in the merger will be
required to file a statement with the holder’s U.S. federal income tax return setting forth such holder’s tax basis in the Cascade
common stock surrendered and the fair market value of the First Interstate Class A common stock and cash received in the merger. A
“significant holder” is a holder of Cascade common stock who, immediately before the merger, owned at least 5% of the outstanding
stock of Cascade.

Regulatory Matters Relating to the Merger

Completion of the merger is subject to the receipt of all approvals required to complete the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement from: (1) the Federal Reserve Board; (2) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; (3) the Montana Division;
(4) the Oregon Division; and (5) any other regulatory approval the failure of which to obtain would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the surviving corporation (which First Interstate and Cascade currently expect to be none), and the expiration
of any applicable statutory waiting periods. In obtaining these approvals, First Interstate is not required, and Cascade and Cascade
Bank are not permitted (without First Interstate’s consent), to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition,
restriction, prohibition, limitation or requirement that would prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation of the business or
assets of Cascade, materially limit the business conducted by First Interstate or First Interstate Bank or compel either Cascade or First
Interstate to dispose of or hold separate any material portion of the business or assets of Cascade or would reasonably be expected to
have a material and adverse effect on First Interstate, the combined company and their respective subsidiaries, as a whole (measured on
a scale relative to Cascade and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole), or on Cascade and Cascade Bank, taken as a whole, in each case after
giving effect to the merger, which we refer to in this document as a “materially burdensome regulatory condition.” Subject to the terms
and conditions of the merger agreement, First Interstate and Cascade have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts and cooperate to
promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to obtain as promptly as practicable all regulatory approvals necessary or
advisable to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such
approvals.

Federal Reserve Board. The merger and the bank merger are subject to approval by the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the Bank Merger Act, respectively. On March 22, 2017, First Interstate received the
approval of the Federal Reserve Board for First Interstate to acquire and merge Cascade with and into First Interstate, with First
Interstate as the surviving entity, thereby acquiring Cascade Bank, and immediately following that merger, to merge Cascade Bank with
and into First Interstate Bank.

The Federal Reserve Board takes into consideration a number of factors when acting on applications under the Bank Merger Act
and the Bank Holding Company Act, including: (1) the financial and managerial resources and the effect of the proposed merger on
these resources (including capital and pro forma capital ratios of the combined organization, the management expertise, internal
controls, and risk management systems, especially those with respect to compliance with laws applicable to consumers and “fair
lending” laws); (2) the effect of the proposal on competition; (3) the future prospects of the existing and merged entities; (4) the
convenience and needs of the communities served; (5) any risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; and
(6) the effectiveness of the acquiring entity in combating money laundering activities. The Federal Reserve Board also reviews the
records of the relevant insured depository institutions under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1997, which we refer to in this
document as the “CRA.” In connection with such a review, the Federal Reserve Board will provide an opportunity for public comment
on the application and is authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if it determines such meeting or other proceeding
would be appropriate.

Table of Contents

In addition, a period of 15 to 30 days must expire following approval by the Federal Reserve Board before completion of the
merger is allowed, within which period the United States Department of Justice may file objections to the merger under the federal
anti-trust laws. While First Interstate and Cascade believe that the likelihood of objection by the Department of Justice is remote in this
case, there can be no assurance that the Department of Justice will not initiate proceedings to block the merger.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The merger and the bank merger are also conditioned on receiving the written consent
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the shared-loss agreements between Cascade Bank and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, unless such shared-loss agreements are terminated prior to the completion of the merger, to ensure that there
will be no adverse change in loss coverage by reason of the completion of the mergers, which consent must be reasonably satisfactory
to First Interstate. First Interstate received the consent of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on March 13, 2017.

Montana Division. Prior approval of the bank merger is required from the Montana Division. The Division requires a thirty-day
public comment period on a bank merger application and may consider any comments received and other factors in considering the
bank merger. First Interstate received the approval of the bank merger from the Montana Division on March 22, 2017.

Oregon Division. The bank merger is subject to the approval of the Oregon Division under the Oregon Bank Act. To approve the
bank merger, the Oregon Division must find that, among other things, the bank merger conforms with the provisions of the Oregon
Bank Act, will not be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the resulting bank, is not contrary to the public’s interest and that the
state or federal supervisory authority that has jurisdiction over the resulting bank permits the transaction. First Interstate received the
approval of the bank merger from the Oregon Division on March 21, 2017.

Additional Regulatory Approvals and Notices. Notifications and/or applications requesting approval may be submitted to various
other federal and state regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations. The bank merger will result in First Interstate’s entry
into the States of Washington and Idaho. Accordingly, First Interstate submitted notices to the Washington State Department of
Financial Institutions and the Idaho Department of Finance on February 14, 2017.

The approval of any application merely implies the satisfaction of regulatory criteria for approval, which does not include review
of the merger from the standpoint of the adequacy of the merger consideration for holders of Cascade common stock. Furthermore,
regulatory approvals do not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of the merger.

Interests of Cascade’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the board of directors of Cascade to approve and adopt the merger agreement, you should
be aware that Cascade’s directors and executive officers have financial interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to,
the interests of Cascade shareholders generally, which are described below. Cascade’s board of directors was aware of these interests
and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Table of Contents

Treatment of Stock Options

The merger agreement provides that all options to purchase Cascade common stock outstanding at the effective time of the
merger, whether or not vested, will be cancelled and, subject to First Interstate’s receipt of an option surrender agreement, the holder
will be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Cascade common stock subject
to the stock option multiplied by (2) the amount by which the value of the merger consideration exceeds the exercise price of such
stock option, less applicable withholding taxes. For purposes of this calculation, the merger consideration is the sum of the cash
consideration and the product of the exchange ratio times the average closing price per share of First Interstate Class A common stock
for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth day preceding the closing date of the merger. If the exercise price of a Cascade
stock option is equal to or greater than the merger consideration, such option will be cancelled at the effective time of the merger for no
consideration.

Treatment of Restricted Stock Awards

The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the merger, each unvested share of restricted stock issued by Cascade
and outstanding at the effective time of the merger will fully vest and convert into the right to receive the same merger consideration
that all other shares of Cascade common stock are entitled to receive in the merger.

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units

The merger agreement provides that all restricted stock units outstanding at the effective time of the merger, whether or not
vested, will be cancelled and, subject to First Interstate’s receipt of a restricted stock unit surrender agreement, the holder will be
entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Cascade common stock subject to the
restricted stock unit multiplied by (2) the value of the merger consideration, less required tax withholding. The merger consideration is
the sum of the cash consideration and the product of the exchange ratio times the average closing price per share of First Interstate
common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth day preceding the closing date of the merger. Cascade’s named
executive officers and non-employee directors do not hold any unvested Cascade restricted stock units.

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards Held by Cascade’s Executive Officers and Directors

For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Cascade’s named executive officers on settlement of their
unvested Cascade equity awards, see “Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Cascade’s Named Executive Officers” below.
Cascade’s non-employee directors do not hold any unvested Cascade stock options or restricted stock awards. For information about
the payments to be made with respect to Cascade’s outstanding equity awards, see “Cascade Stock Options, Restricted Stock Awards
and Restricted Stock Units” beginning on page 90.

Payments Under Employment Agreements With Cascade

Cascade and Cascade Bank previously entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Zink, Newton, Reeves and Lee and
Ms. Biss. The employment agreements provide that in the event of an involuntary termination of employment without cause (as
defined in each executive’s agreement) or voluntary termination by the executive for good reason (as defined in each executive’s
agreement) within 12 months before or 18 months after a change in control (as defined in each executive’s agreement), the executive
will receive an amount equal to 2.99 times their base salary plus their annual cash incentive in effect for the year in which the change in
control occurs, which we refer to in this document as the “Change in Control Payment.” The aggregate amount of the Change in
Control Payments is estimated to be $5,809,933. The Change in Control Payments may be reduced, however, if the executive is
initially determined to be subject to excise taxes under the Internal Revenue

Code but would be better economically on a net-after tax basis by reducing the Change in Control Payments to avoid being subject to
the excise tax. For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Cascade’s named executive officers under their
employment agreements, see “Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Cascade’s Named Executive Officers” below. In addition,
all outstanding unvested restricted stock and stock options will fully vest upon termination and Cascade (or its successor) will provide
certain employment benefits for 18 months following the date of termination.

2017 Executive Incentive Program

Messrs. Zink, Newton, Reeves and Lee and Ms. Biss are participants in the 2017 Annual Executive Incentive Program, which
provides the executives an opportunity to earn a performance-based annual cash bonus. Target annual bonus opportunities were
established based on the executive’s level of responsibility and his or her ability to impact overall results and are expressed as a
percentage of base salary and are awarded as a percentage of target. Under the merger agreement, Cascade has the right to pay
pro-rated annual bonus awards in respect of the 2017 fiscal year on the closing date for the period from January 1, 2017 through the
closing date of the merger. Achievement level and calculated bonus amounts will be pro-rated for the portion of the 2017 fiscal year
before the closing date. For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to Messrs. Zink, Newton, Reeves and Lee and Ms. Biss
in connection with the merger if the closing date were to occur on January 20, 2017, see “Merger-Related Executive Compensation for
Cascade’s Named Executive Officers” below.

Stipulation Agreements With First Interstate and Cascade

In connection with the merger agreement, First Interstate, First Interstate Bank, Cascade and Cascade Bank entered into
stipulation agreements with Messrs. Zink, Newton, Reeves and Lee and Ms. Biss that sets forth the methodology to calculate the cash
severance payable pursuant to the terms of the individual’s employment agreements. For an estimate of the amounts that would be
payable to Messrs. Zink, Newton, Reeves and Lee and Ms. Biss under their stipulation agreements, see “Merger-Related Executive
Compensation for Cascade’s Named Executive Officers” below.

Continued Employment by the Combined Company

Upon the completion of the merger, Cascade’s named executive officers are not expected to be retained by the combined
company. However, during the merger negotiations, First Interstate informed Cascade that it is interested in retaining Mr. Reeves,
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Cascade and President and Chief Operating Officer of Cascade Bank, and
employing him as Chief Banking Officer—West of First Interstate Bank. As a result, Mr. Reeves and First Interstate may enter into
new compensatory agreements or arrangements.

Treatment of Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans

Cascade and Cascade Bank previously entered into a supplemental executive retirement plan with each of Mr. Newton and
Ms. Biss. Mr. Newton and Ms. Biss are eligible for normal retirement benefits upon separation from service except in the case of a
termination for cause (as defined in the agreement). The annual benefit payable to Mr. Newton is $77,150 and the annual benefit
payable to Ms. Biss is $94,250. Commencing on the first anniversary after payments begin, benefits are increased annually by 2.5%.
Benefits are payable monthly for 20 years. If the participant dies during active employment, the benefit is payable to the participant’s
beneficiary beginning on the first day of the fourth month after death. The agreements include non-competition and non-solicitation
provisions that result in forfeiture (and repayment, if applicable) of all benefits if the participant competes with Cascade Bank or
violates non-solicitation requirements during employment or within 18 months following termination of employment. Mr. Newton and
Ms. Biss are not entitled to any additional benefits under these agreements in connection with the merger.

Table of Contents

Appointment of Two Directors to First Interstate’s Board of Directors

The merger agreement provides that at or immediately following the effective time of the merger, two members of Cascade’s
board of directors will be appointed to First Interstate’s board of directors.

Payments under Director Agreements

Each of Messrs. Andres and Patrick are party to a director emeritus agreement, which provides for a benefit of $18,000 per year
for a minimum of 10 years. The benefit will be paid in monthly installments from the earlier of such director’s normal retirement date
or the completion of the merger until the later of the director’s death or 120 months. The annual benefit payments are subject to a 2.5%
annual increase. Messrs. Andres, Johnson, Patrick and Wells are parties to Deferred Fee Agreements, with interest credited annually at
a rate of 4.32%. Following the completion of the merger, if any of Messrs. Andres, Johnson, Patrick or Wells is not continuing as a
director of First Interstate, than such person will receive a distribution of their accumulated deferrals, plus accrued interest and
earnings, to be paid in a lump sum within 30 days after the termination of their service with Cascade.

Indemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers

In the merger agreement, First Interstate has agreed to indemnify, hold harmless and advances expenses to the current and former
officers and directors of Cascade and its subsidiaries against any costs, expenses, judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlements,
damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether arising before or
after the effective time of the merger, pertaining to any matter that existed or occurred at or before the effective time of the merger to
the same extent as Cascade currently provides for indemnification of its officers and directors. First Interstate has also agreed to
maintain in effect for a period of six years following the effective time of the merger the directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
policy currently maintained by Cascade or to provide a policy with comparable coverage, provided that, to obtain such insurance
coverage, First Interstate is not obligated to expend, in the aggregate, an amount exceeding 250% of the amount of the annual
premiums currently paid by Cascade for such insurance.

Table of Contents

Merger-Related Executive Compensation for Cascade’s Named Executive Officers

The following table sets forth the estimated potential severance benefits to Cascade’s named executive officers on termination of
employment in connection with a change in control and assumes that the effective time of the merger will be April 4, 2017, the last
practicable date prior to the date of these materials. If the merger closes after June 11, 2017, then the estimated payment in connection
with a change of control listed below will change as some of the restricted stock awards will have vested without regard to the change
of control and cash payments may change because of the right to pro-rated bonuses and the requirements to reduce severance under the
employment agreements if an executive is initially determined to be subject to excise taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue
Code. This table does not include the value of benefits in which the named executive officers are vested without regard to the
occurrence of a change in control. The amounts shown below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not
actually occur, and as a result, the actual amounts to be received by a named executive officer may differ materially from the amounts
shown below.

(1) In connection with the merger agreement, each of the named executive officers entered into a stipulation agreement that sets forth

the methodology to calculate the cash severance payable pursuant to the terms of the named executive officer’s employment
agreements. Under the stipulation and employment agreements, the named executive officers are entitled to a lump-sum cash
payment, which represents an amount equal to 2.99 times their base salary and annual cash incentive, provided the executive’s
employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or voluntarily for good reason within 12 months before or 18 months
following the effective time of the merger estimated to be $2,631,200, $1,094,063, $1,192,263, $1,018,842 and $975,488
respectively for Messrs. Zink, Newton, Reeves and Lee and Ms. Biss. In addition, the named executive officers are entitled to a
pro-rated bonus for 2017, and the estimated bonus, which is included in the above cash payments in the table, is $84,986,
$29,245, $31,870, $27,234 and $26,075, respectively, for Messrs. Zink, Newton, Reeves, Lee and Ms. Biss, respectively. The cash
severance amounts payable under this column are considered a “double trigger” benefit since they are only payable upon a change
in control of Cascade and termination of employment and the 2017 bonus is a “single trigger.” The cash severance payments may
be limited if the executive is initially determined to be subject to excise taxes under the Internal Revenue Code but would be
better economically on a net-after tax basis by reducing the cash severance payments to avoid being subject to the excise tax, and
accordingly, the above cash payments reflect a reduction for Messrs. Zink, Newton, Reeves and Lee and Ms. Biss, respectively, of
$499,320, $140,912, $256,547, $81,438 and $95,060, respectively.

(2) Represents the estimated cash payment to be made in exchange for the cancellation of the non-vested stock options and the value
of non-vested restricted stock awards held by Cascade’s named executive officers at the effective time of the merger. The value of
the stock options and restricted stock awards is based on a per share price of Cascade common stock of $7.15, which is the
average closing market price of Cascade common stock over the five business days following the public announcement of the
merger. Messrs. Zink, Newton, Reeves and Lee and Ms. Biss do not hold any unvested restricted stock units. The amounts
payable under this column are considered a “single trigger” benefit since it is payable upon a change in control of Cascade
without regard to termination of employment.

(3) Represents the estimated value of continued medical, disability, life and dental coverage for 18 months, which will be provided at
no cost to the executive.

Employee Matters

Each person who is an employee of Cascade Bank as of the effective time of the merger (whose employment is not specifically
terminated as of the merger date) will become an employee of First Interstate Bank and will be eligible to participate in employee
benefit plans and compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable to the employee benefit and compensation opportunities
that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of First Interstate Bank; provided, however, that any cash incentive
compensation payable or earned in the calendar year in which the merger occurs will be pro-rated to reflect the short year. With respect
to any First Interstate Bank medical, dental or vision insurance plan, for the first plan year in which such continuing employee is
eligible to participate, First Interstate Bank will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any preexisting condition limitations or
eligibility waiting periods to be waived to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under a Cascade Bank benefit
plan in which such continuing employee participated before the merger and credit each continuing employee for any co-payments or
deductibles incurred by such continuing employee in such plan year for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket
expense requirements under any such plan.

Continuing employees will receive prior service credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits (for purposes of
vacation, paid time off and sick leave policies) provided that such recognition of service will not (1) apply to any First Interstate Bank
defined benefit retirement plan or retiree welfare plan, (2) operate to duplicate any benefits with respect to the same period of service,
(3) apply for purposes of any plan under which similarly situated employees do not receive credit for prior service or that is
grandfathered or frozen, or (4) entitle a continuing employee to be credited with more than 120 hours of vacation, paid time off and
sick leave on the closing date of the merger and to rollover more than 80 hours of such paid-time off from one calendar year to a
subsequent calendar year.

Each employee of Cascade or Cascade Bank whose employment is involuntarily terminated by First Interstate (other than for
cause) within one year following the effective time of the merger and who is not covered by a separate employment agreement, change
in control agreement or other agreement that provides for the payment of severance will, upon executing an appropriate release in the
form reasonably determined by First Interstate, receive a severance payment in accordance with the terms of Cascade Bank’s severance
policy. The policy provides a severance formula based on years of service and position, with a minimum payment equal to four weeks
for base pay (six weeks for senior vice presidents) and a maximum payment equal to 26 weeks of base pay (36 weeks for senior vice
presidents).

For a period of six months following the merger, First Interstate will provide all employees of Cascade Bank whose employment
was terminated other than for cause, disability or retirement at or following the merger, job counseling and outplacement assistance
services to assist such employees in locating new employment. First Interstate will notify all such employees of opportunities for
positions that First Interstate Bank reasonably believes such persons are qualified and will consider any application for such positions
submitted by such persons, provided, however, that any decision to offer employment to any such person will be made in the sole
discretion of First Interstate Bank. The total costs expended for such job counseling and outplacement assistance services will not
exceed $150,000 in the aggregate.

A retention bonus pool will be established for employees of Cascade Bank other than employees of Cascade who are covered by
employment agreements or other contracts providing for severance, as jointly designated by First Interstate and Cascade Bank. The
amount and payment date of the retention bonus for each employee will be jointly determined by First Interstate and Cascade.

Operations of Cascade Bank after the Merger

After the merger of Cascade Bank and First Interstate Bank, all of the former offices of Cascade Bank are expected to operate as
branch offices of First Interstate Bank under the name “First Interstate Bank.”

Restrictions on Resale of Shares of First Interstate Class A Common Stock

The shares of First Interstate Class A common stock to be issued to shareholders of Cascade under the merger agreement will be
registered under the Securities Act and may be freely traded by such shareholders without restriction (unless they are affiliates of First
Interstate, in which case certain restrictions under the securities laws may apply).

Time of Completion

Unless the parties agree otherwise and unless the merger agreement has otherwise been terminated, the completion of the merger
will take place on a date mutually agreed to by the parties within three business days following the date on which all of the conditions
to the merger contained in the merger agreement are satisfied or waived. See “— Conditions to Completing the Merger.” On the closing
date, First Interstate will file articles of merger with the Montana Secretary of State and the Oregon Secretary of State merging Cascade
into First Interstate. The merger will become effective at the time stated in the articles of merger.

It is currently expected that the merger will be completed early in the third quarter of 2017. However, because completion of the
merger is subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, the parties cannot be certain of the actual timing.

Conditions to Completing the Merger

First Interstate’s and Cascade’s obligations to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction, or, to the extent permitted by
law, waiver of several conditions, including:
 

 •  approval and adoption of the merger agreement by each of the First Interstate shareholders and the Cascade shareholders;
 

 •  approval of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate by First Interstate shareholders;
 

 
•  First Interstate filing a notice with The Nasdaq Stock Market for the listing of the shares of First Interstate Class A common

stock to be issued by First Interstate in the merger, and The Nasdaq Stock Market authorizing and not objecting to the listing
of such shares of First Interstate Class A common stock;

 

 
•  receipt of all required regulatory approvals and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods, provided that no regulatory

approvals contain a condition, restriction, prohibition, limitation or requirement that has resulted in the imposition of a
materially burdensome regulatory condition;

 

 
•  the registration statement of which this document forms a part being declared effective by the SEC and the absence of any

pending or threatened proceeding by the SEC to suspend the effectiveness of the registration statement;
 

 
•  no order, injunction or decree or other legal restraint or prohibition that prevents consummating the merger, the bank merger

Covenants of Cascade and First Interstate

Agreement Not to Solicit Other Proposals. Cascade has agreed not to (1) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate inquiries or proposals regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, an acquisition proposal by a third party, (2) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person concerning
an acquisition proposal by a third party, (3) disclose or provide any confidential or non-public information or data to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, any person in connection with an acquisition proposal or (4) unless the merger agreement has been
terminated, enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or other agreement relating to any acquisition proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted
by the merger agreement); provided, however, that Cascade and its representatives may contact any person who has made an
acquisition proposal or inquiry or proposal solely to seek clarification of the terms and conditions of such proposal. An acquisition
proposal means any offer, proposal or inquiry, relating to any third party indication of interest in:
 

 
•  any acquisition or purchase of at least 15% of the consolidated assets of Cascade or the equity or voting securities of

Cascade or Cascade Bank;
 

 
•  any tender offer, exchange offer or other acquisition of at least 15% of the equity or voting securities of Cascade or Cascade

Bank; or
 

 
•  a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or

other similar transaction involving Cascade or Cascade Bank.

Cascade’s board of directors may generally participate in negotiations or discussions with, and provide confidential or non-public
information or data to, a third party who makes an unsolicited, written, bona fide acquisition proposal before the Cascade shareholder
meeting, provided that:
 

 
•  Cascade’s board of directors, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, and, with respect to financial matters, its

financial advisors, concludes in good faith that failure to take such actions would more likely than not result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

 

 

•  before furnishing any confidential or non-public information to, or entering into negotiations or discussions with, such
person, Cascade must provide First Interstate with written notice and have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such
third party on terms no less favorable to Cascade than the confidentiality agreement between First Interstate and Cascade,
including no right to negotiate exclusively with the third party.

Cascade must within 24 hours of receipt of any acquisition proposal or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
acquisition proposal advise First Interstate of the substance of such proposal and the identity of the third party and provide an
unredacted copy of the acquisition proposal and any draft agreements, proposals and other materials received in connection with such
proposal. Cascade must apprise First Interstate of any related material developments, discussions and negotiations on a reasonably
current basis, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or acquisition proposal (including providing an
unredacted copy of such amended or revised acquisition proposal and any further or revised draft agreements, proposals or other
materials received in connection with such inquiry or acquisition proposal).

In certain circumstances, Cascade may terminate the merger agreement before obtaining the Cascade shareholders’ approval of
the merger agreement to enter into an agreement with a third party with respect to an acquisition proposal, but only if Cascade’s board
of directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors) that the failure to take such action would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law and Cascade has not materially breached its obligations under the no solicitation provisions in the merger agreement. In
such instance, Cascade would be required to pay First Interstate a termination fee, as further described in the section entitled
“— Termination Fee” on page 110.

after the other party’s written request or (4) only in the case of Cascade, adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an
acquisition proposal or fail to publicly, definitively and without qualification issue a press release recommending against an
acquisition proposal, within ten business days after an acquisition proposal is made public, or publicly propose to do any of
the foregoing; provided, however, that if, before the adoption and approval of the merger agreement by a party’s
shareholders, a party’s board of directors, after consultation with its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to recommend the merger agreement (and, in the case of First Interstate, the proposal to approve
the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate) to such party’s shareholders (and, if such determination
relates to an acquisition proposal to Cascade, Cascade’s board of directors has taken into account the expected timing of and
regulatory conditions related to such acquisition proposal), then such party’s board of directors may change its
recommendation to its shareholders but only if (1) that party gives

faith that it would nevertheless continue to be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to make its recommendation to the shareholders.

•  by either party, if a required regulatory approval, consent or waiver is denied or any governmental entity prohibits the

perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party;

 

 

•  by either party, if the merger is not consummated by November 17, 2017, unless failure to complete the merger by that time

closing have been satisfied or waived except for the receipt of regulatory approvals either party may extend the termination

Table of Contents

Termination Fee

The merger agreement requires Cascade to pay First Interstate a fee of $22.1 million if Cascade terminates the merger agreement
to enter into an agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal. Additionally, Cascade must pay the termination fee if First Interstate
terminates the merger agreement as a result of a breach by Cascade of its covenants regarding acquisition proposals or its obligation to
submit the merger agreement to its shareholders, or if Cascade’s board of directors fails to recommend approval of the merger
agreement or, after recommending the approval of the merger agreement, it withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation.

First Interstate must pay to Cascade the $22.1 million termination fee if Cascade terminates the merger agreement because First
Interstate’s board of directors fails to recommend approval of the merger agreement and the amended and restated articles of First
Interstate in this document or, after recommending the approval of the merger agreement and the amended and restated articles of First
Interstate, it withdraws, modifies or changes its recommendation or as a result of a breach in any material respect by First Interstate of
its covenants regarding its obligation to submit the merger agreement to its shareholders.

If either party terminates the merger agreement because the merger is not consummated by November 17, 2017 (or six-months
later as permitted by the merger agreement), then Cascade must pay the termination fee if (1) an acquisition proposal was made directly
to the Cascade shareholders or publicly announced before the Cascade shareholder meeting, (2) Cascade’s shareholders fail to approve
and adopt the merger agreement and (3) within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement, Cascade consummates or enters
into an agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal.

If First Interstate terminates the merger agreement because Cascade breaches a covenant or agreement or if any representation or
warranty of Cascade has become untrue (subject to the materiality standard contained in the merger agreement) and such breach or
untrue representation or warranty has not been or cannot be cured within 30 days following written notice to Cascade or if either party
terminates the merger agreement because Cascade’s shareholders fail to approve and adopt the merger agreement, then Cascade must
pay the termination fee if (1) an acquisition proposal was made directly to the Cascade shareholders or publicly announced before the
termination of the merger agreement and (2) within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement, Cascade consummates or
enters into an agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal (provided that for purposes of this provision references in the
definition of acquisition proposal to 15% will instead be 50%).

Expenses

Each of First Interstate and Cascade will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger.

Changing the Terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger

Before the completion of the merger, First Interstate and Cascade may agree to waive, amend or modify any provision of the
merger agreement. However, after the vote by Cascade shareholders or First Interstate shareholders, First Interstate and Cascade can
make no amendment or modification that would require approval of its shareholders under applicable law without obtaining that
approval.

Voting Agreements

Cascade entered into voting agreements with First Interstate’s directors, solely in their capacity as holders of First Interstate
common stock, pursuant to which, among other things, they agreed (1) to vote their shares of First Interstate common stock in favor of
the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate and
(2) without the prior written consent of Cascade, not to transfer any of their shares of First Interstate common stock except for certain
limited purposes described in the voting agreements. These voting agreements will terminate if the merger agreement is terminated. As
of the March 17, 2017, shares constituting 41.9% of the voting power of First Interstate common stock were subject to the voting
agreements.

capacity as holders of Cascade common stock, pursuant to which, among other things, they agreed (1) to vote their shares of Cascade
common stock in favor of the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and (2) without the prior written consent of First
Interstate, not to transfer any of their shares of Cascade common stock except for certain limited purposes described in the voting
agreements. The voting agreements will terminate if the merger agreement is terminated. In addition, if the merger agreement has not
been terminated and Cascade’s board of directors withdraws, modifies or qualifies or fails to make its recommendation to Cascade
shareholders to adopt and approve the merger agreement, then the voting agreements with the Cascade shareholders will terminate
unless Cascade and First Interstate agree to require that at least 75% of Cascade’s common stock must adopt and approve the merger
agreement as a condition to completion of the merger. As of the March 17, 2017, shares constituting 55.2% of the outstanding shares of
Cascade common stock were subject to the voting agreements.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

Following the announcement on November 17, 2016 of the execution of the merger agreement, three lawsuits challenging the
proposed transaction were filed. One lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for Deschutes County and is
captioned Sternheim Family Trust v. Cascade Bancorp, et al., No. 17CV06744 (filed February 16, 2017). The second lawsuit was filed
in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for Multnomah County and is captioned Crosse v. Cascade Bancorp, et al., No. 17CV08305
(filed February 24, 2017). The third lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon and is captioned
Parshall v. Cascade Bancorp et al., No. 6:17-cv-00405-JR (filed March 13, 2017).

Each of these lawsuits challenging the proposed transaction is a putative class action filed on behalf of the shareholders of
Cascade and names as defendants Cascade, its directors, and First Interstate. The Sternheim Family Trust and Crosse complaints allege
that the directors of Cascade breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their approval of the merger agreement by, among other
things: agreeing to an allegedly unfair price for Cascade; approving the transaction notwithstanding alleged conflicts of interest;
agreeing to deal protection devices that plaintiffs allege are unreasonable; and by failing to disclose certain facts about the process that
led to the merger and financial analyses performed by Cascade’s financial advisors. The Sternheim Family Trust and Crosse complaints
also allege that First Interstate aided and abetted those alleged fiduciary breaches. The Parshall complaint alleges that Cascade and its
directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act by failing to disclose certain facts about the process that led to the merger and
financial analyses performed by Cascade’s financial advisors. The Parshall complaint further alleges that First Interstate and Cascade’s
board of directors violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by acting as control persons. Each of the actions seek, among other
things, an order enjoining completion of the proposed merger. Other potential plaintiffs may also file additional lawsuits challenging
the proposed transaction.

The outcome of the pending and any additional future litigation is uncertain. If the cases are not resolved, these lawsuits could
prevent or delay completion of the merger and result in substantial costs to First Interstate and Cascade, including any costs associated
with the indemnification of directors and officers. One of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no order, injunction or
decree or other legal restraint or prohibition that prevents consummating the merger, the bank merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement will be in effect. As such, if plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the
completion of the merger on the agreed-upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the merger from being completed, or from being
completed within the expected timeframe. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the
merger is completed may adversely affect First Interstate’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method
of accounting, giving effect to the merger of First Interstate with Cascade. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated
balance sheet combines the historical information of First Interstate and Cascade as of December 31, 2016 and assumes that the merger
was completed on that date. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated income statement combines the historical
financial information of First Interstate and Cascade and give effect to the merger as if it had been completed as of the beginning of
2016. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and
is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial condition had the merger been completed on the dates described
above, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operations in future periods or the future financial position of the combined
entities. The financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Condensed Consolidated Financial Information. Certain reclassifications have been made to Cascade’s historical financial information
to conform to First Interstate’s presentation of financial information.

The actual value of First Interstate Class A common stock to be recorded as consideration in the merger will be based on the
closing price of First Interstate Class A common stock on the date of the merger is completed. The merger is targeted for completion
early in the third quarter of 2017. For purposes of the pro forma financial information, the fair value of First Interstate Class A common
stock to be issued in connection with the merger was based on First Interstate’s average five-day closing stock price of $43.37 as of
March 8, 2017.

The pro forma financial information includes estimated adjustments, including adjustments to record assets and liabilities of
Cascade at their respective fair values and represents the pro forma estimates by First Interstate based on available fair value
information as of the date of the merger agreement. In some cases, where noted, more recent information has been used to support
estimated adjustments in the pro forma financial information.

The pro forma adjustments included in this section are subject to change depending on changes in interest rates and the
components of assets and liabilities and as additional information becomes available and additional analyses are performed. The final
allocation of the purchase price for the merger will be determined after the merger is completed and after completion of thorough
analyses to determine the fair value of Cascade tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the date the merger is
completed. Increases or decreases in the estimated fair values of the net assets as compared with the information shown in the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information may change the amount of the purchase price allocated to
other assets and liabilities and the residual goodwill value, and may impact First Interstate’s income statement due to adjustments in
yield and/or amortization of the adjusted assets or liabilities. Any changes to Cascade’s shareholders’ equity, including results of
operations from December 31, 2016 through the date the merger is completed, will also change the purchase price allocation, which
may include the recording of a lower or higher amount of goodwill. The final adjustments may be materially different from the
unaudited pro forma adjustments presented in this document.

First Interstate anticipates that the merger will provide the combined company with financial benefits that include reduced
operating expenses. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial data, while helpful in illustrating the
financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions, does not reflect the benefits of expected cost savings
or opportunities to earn additional revenue and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. It also does not
necessarily reflect what the historical results of the combined company would have been had our companies been combined during
these periods.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information has been derived from and should be read in
conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of First Interstate and Cascade, which are
incorporated in this document by reference.

Unaudited Combined Condensed Consolidated Pro Forma Statement of Financial Condition
As of December 31, 2016

(Dollars in thousands)
 

* Assumes that the acquisition of Cascade was completed as of December 31, 2016 utilizing the acquisition method of accounting.
Estimated fair value adjustments for loans, investment securities, core deposit intangibles, deposits and fixed assets were
determined by management of First Interstate and Cascade. Actual fair value adjustments, where appropriate, will be determined
as of the merger completion date and will be amortized and accreted into income.

 

** This column removes the unamortized purchase accounting adjustments from prior acquisitions executed by Cascade.
 

(1) The pro forma adjustment of $175,422, includes $145,551 of cash consideration paid to acquire Cascade at a stated price of $1.91
for each share of Cascade common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date and additional cash adjustments of $10,755
related to the cash pay-out of Cascade’s stock options and restricted stock units and acquisition costs. Also includes $19,116 of
cash paid for acquisition costs.

 

(2) Represents the estimated $7,805 fair value adjustment to Cascade’s investment portfolio.
 

(3) The pro forma adjustment of $7,954 includes an accretable component of $31,244 and a non- accretable component of $2,440
offset by the removal of Cascade’s pre-existing allowance for loan loss and existing fair value adjustments of $25,730 which are
not carried over.

 

(4) Represents a $1,499 write-up of the premises and equipment based upon fair value estimates.
 

(5) Represents a fair value adjustment for Cascade’s mortgage servicing assets of $2,660. The existing Cascade fair value adjustment
of $2,348 is not carried over.

 

(6) Represents adjustments in the net deferred tax assets of $17,798 resulting from the fair value adjustments related to the acquired
assets and liabilities, identifiable intangibles and other deferred tax items. The actual tax liability adjustment will depend on facts
and circumstances existing at the completion of the merger. The fair value adjustment of the net deferred tax asset and liabilities
assumes a tax rate of 37.5%. The existing Cascade deferred tax asset of $5,173 resulting from fair value adjustments is not carried
over.

 

(7) Represents the recognition of the fair value of the core deposit intangible asset and other identifiable intangible assets. The core
deposits intangible asset approximates 1.5% of estimated core deposit liabilities assumed. Core deposits are defined as total
deposits less time deposits. The existing Cascade fair value adjustments of $12,317 are not carried over.

(8) Calculated to reflect the acquisition accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Cascade. The consideration to be paid to
acquire Cascade consists of the right to receive 0.14864 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and $1.91 in cash for
each issued and outstanding share of Cascade common stock. For purposes of this pro forma financial presentation, the number of
shares of First Interstate Class A common stock issued as consideration for the acquisition of 11,327,095 was based on the
Cascade’s outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2016 and the March 8, 2017 prior five-day average closing price of
First Interstate’s Class A common stock of $43.37 per share. The acquisition accounting adjustments assume that Cascade’s
stockholders’ equity is eliminated and purchase price, goodwill and intangible assets are reflected on the financial statement of
First Interstate pursuant to the application of acquisition accounting. The existing Cascade goodwill of $85,852 is not carried over.

The final purchase price and resulting goodwill from the acquisition will vary based on the market price of First Interstate’s
Class A common stock as of the consummation of the transaction. Management of First Interstate estimates that a 10% fluctuation
in the market price of its Class A common stock is reasonably possible based on its average volatility, resulting in the following
aggregate purchase price and estimated goodwill:

 
   Price***    Goodwill  
As presented in the pro forma combined results   $647,562   $348,679 
10% increase in Class A common stock price    698,906    400,023 
10% decrease in Class A common stock price    596,218    297,335 

 

*** Purchase price includes the right to receive 0.14864 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and $1.91 in cash for each
share of Cascade common stock.

 

(9) Represents a fair value adjustment for a tax benefit receivable attributable to the cash equivalent payout of Cascade stock options
and restricted units at closing.

(10) Represents a fair value adjustment to deposits to reflect the difference between portfolio yields and market rates for time deposits
acquired in the acquisition. Yield adjustments were calculated using present value analysis. Cash flow was discounted to present
value using market rates for similar deposits. The yield adjustment is the aggregate present value for the difference. The existing
Cascade fair value adjustment of $90 is not carried over.

 

(11) Reflects the elimination of Cascade’s stockholders’ equity and the issuance of 11,327,095 shares of First Interstate Class A
common stock at a price of $43.37 per share.

* This column presents pro forma information pertaining to acquisitions by First Interstate and Cascade during the period presented

to present the pro forma data as if those acquisitions had occurred as January 1, 2016.
 

(1) Assumes that the acquisition of Cascade was completed as of the beginning of the earliest period presented utilizing the
acquisition method of accounting. Estimated fair value adjustments for loans, investment securities, core deposit intangibles, time
deposits and fixed assets were determined by management of First Interstate and Cascade. The resulting premiums and discounts
for purposes of the unaudited combined condensed consolidated pro forma financial data, where appropriate, are being amortized
and accreted into income as more fully described in the notes below. Actual fair value adjustments will be determined as of the
merger completion date and will be amortized and accreted into income over the estimated remaining lives of the respective assets
and liabilities.

DESCRIPTION OF FIRST INTERSTATE CAPITAL STOCK

As a result of the merger, Cascade shareholders will become First Interstate shareholders. Your rights as a shareholder of First
Interstate will be governed by the Montana Business Corporation Act, which we refer to in this document as the “MBCA,” First
Interstate’s amended and restated articles of incorporation and First Interstate’s bylaws. The following summary describes the material
terms of First Interstate’s capital stock and is subject to, and qualified by, First Interstate’s amended and restated articles of
incorporation and bylaws and Montana law. We urge you to read the applicable provisions of the MBCA, First Interstate’s amended
and restated articles of incorporation and First Interstate’s bylaws. Copies of First Interstate’s governing documents have been filed
with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information” as to how to obtain a copy of First Interstate’s articles of incorporation and
bylaws.

General

First Interstate’s articles of incorporation provide for two classes of common stock: First Interstate Class A common stock, which
has one vote per share, and First Interstate Class B common stock, which has five votes per share. Any holder of First Interstate
Class B common stock may at any time convert his or her shares into shares of First Interstate Class A common stock on a
share-for-share basis, and the shares of First Interstate Class B common stock will be automatically converted into shares of First
Interstate Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis:
 

 
•  when the aggregate number of shares of First Interstate Class B common stock outstanding as of the record date for any

meeting of First Interstate shareholders is less than 20% of the aggregate number of shares of First Interstate Class A
common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock then outstanding; or

 

 
•  upon any transfer, whether or not for value, except for permitted transfers as set forth in First Interstate’s articles of

incorporation and described below.

The shares of First Interstate Class B common stock are generally non-transferable, except in connection with a permitted transfer
as set forth in First Interstate’s articles of incorporation and described below. The rights of the two classes of First Interstate’s common
stock are otherwise identical.

First Interstate’s authorized capital stock consists of 200,100,000 shares, each with no par value per share, of which:
 

 •  100,000,000 shares are designated as First Interstate Class A common stock;
 

 •  100,000,000 shares are designated as First Interstate Class B common stock; and
 

 •  100,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.

At March 17, 2017 First Interstate had issued and outstanding 21,923,892 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and
23,217,418 shares of First Interstate Class B common stock. At March 17, 2017, First Interstate also had outstanding stock options to
purchase an aggregate of 33,178 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock. There were no outstanding shares of First Interstate
preferred stock at March 17, 2017.

Common Stock

Dividends. The holders of First Interstate Class A common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock are entitled to share
equally, on a per share basis, in any dividends that First Interstate’s board of directors may declare from time to time from legally
available funds, subject to limitations under Montana law and the preferential rights of holders of any outstanding shares of preferred
stock. If a dividend is paid in the form of shares of common stock or rights to acquire shares of common stock, the holders of First
Interstate Class A

Table of Contents

common stock will be entitled to receive First Interstate Class A common stock, or rights to acquire First Interstate Class A common
stock, as the case may be, and the holders of First Interstate Class B common stock will be entitled to receive shares of First Interstate
Class B common stock, or rights to acquire First Interstate Class B common stock, as the case may be. First Interstate is not subject to
regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. However, its ability to pay dividends may depend, in part, upon dividends it
receives from First Interstate Bank. Applicable regulations limit dividends and other distributions by First Interstate Bank.

Voting Rights. The holders of First Interstate common stock possess exclusive voting rights. The holders of First Interstate
Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and the holders of First Interstate Class B common stock are entitled to five
votes per share on any matter to be voted upon by the shareholders. Holders of First Interstate Class A common stock and First
Interstate Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a
vote of shareholders, unless otherwise required by law or First Interstate’s articles of incorporation.

First Interstate’s articles of incorporation provide that it may not, without first obtaining the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of First Interstate Class A common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock, each voting as a
separate class, issue any additional shares of First Interstate Class B common stock, subject to certain exceptions. The holders of First
Interstate common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors. Directors will be elected
by a majority of the voting power of the shares of First Interstate capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting
and entitled to vote on the election of directors.

Liquidation. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of First Interstate, the holders of First Interstate Class A common stock
and First Interstate Class B common stock are entitled to share equally, on a per share basis, in all First Interstate’s assets available for
distribution after payment or provision for payment of all its debts and liabilities. If First Interstate issues preferred stock, the holders of
First Interstate preferred stock may have a priority over the holders of First Interstate common stock upon liquidation or dissolution.

Conversion. First Interstate Class A common stock is not convertible into any other shares of First Interstate’s capital stock. Each
share of First Interstate Class B common stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into one share of First Interstate
Class A common stock. However, each share of First Interstate Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share of
First Interstate Class A common stock upon certain transfers that are not permitted under First Interstate’s articles of incorporation. See
“—Transfer” below. Once converted into First Interstate Class A common stock, the First Interstate Class B common stock cannot be
reissued.

Transfer. Outstanding shares of First Interstate Class B common stock are subject to transfer restrictions under First Interstate’s
articles of incorporation, limiting their transfer principally to: (1) the holder’s spouse; (2) certain of the holder’s relatives; (3) estates,
trusts or other fiduciary arrangements established for the benefit of a holder of First Interstate Class B common stock; (4) certain
charitable remainder trusts; provided that the noncharitable beneficiary of any such trust is one or more of the individuals or fiduciary
arrangements set forth in (1) through (3) above; and (5) corporations and partnerships wholly-owned by holders of First Interstate
Class B common stock and/or any one or more of the individuals or fiduciary arrangements set forth in (1) through (3) above.
Furthermore, the First Interstate Class B common stock is not listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or any other exchange, and there is
no trading market for the First Interstate Class B common stock.

Shares of First Interstate Class B common stock will convert automatically into shares of First Interstate Class A common stock if
they are transferred to any party who is not an eligible transferee as described in the preceding paragraph and set forth in First
Interstate’s articles of incorporation.

Subdivision; Combination. No class of common stock may be subdivided or combined unless the other class of common stock
concurrently is subdivided or combined in the same proportion and in the same manner.

Preemptive Rights. The holders of First Interstate common stock do not have any preemptive rights.

Table of Contents

Preferred Stock

First Interstate’s board of directors is authorized, without approval of the holders of First Interstate Class A common stock or First
Interstate Class B common stock, to issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series in such number and with such
designations, preferences, powers and other special rights as may be stated in the resolution providing for such preferred stock. The
issuance of First Interstate preferred stock with voting, dividend, liquidation and conversion rights could dilute the voting strength of
the holders of First Interstate common stock and may assist management in impeding an unfriendly takeover or attempted change in
control.

Anti-Takeover Considerations and Provisions of First Interstate’s Articles, Bylaws and Montana Law

A number of provisions of First Interstate’s articles of incorporation and bylaws concern matters of corporate governance and the
rights of First Interstate’s shareholders. Certain of these provisions may have an anti-takeover effect by discouraging takeover attempts
not first approved by First Interstate’s board of directors, including takeovers that may be considered by some of First Interstate’s
shareholders to be in their best interests. To the extent takeover attempts are discouraged, temporary fluctuations in the market price of
First Interstate Class A common stock, which may result from actual or rumored takeover attempts, may be inhibited. Such provisions
also could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors or the assumption of control by shareholders, even if such removal or
assumption would be viewed by First Interstate’s shareholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions also could discourage or
make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, even if such a transaction could be viewed by First Interstate’s shareholders
as beneficial to their interests and could potentially depress the market price of First Interstate Class A common stock. First Interstate’s
board of directors believes that these provisions are appropriate to protect First Interstate’s interests and the interests of First Interstate’s
shareholders.

Preferred Stock. First Interstate’s board of directors may from time to time authorize the issuance of one or more classes or series
of preferred stock without shareholder approval. Subject to the provisions of First Interstate’s articles of incorporation, limitations
prescribed by law and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, if applicable, First Interstate’s board of directors is authorized to adopt
resolutions to issue shares, establish the number of shares, change the number of shares constituting any series and provide or change
the voting powers, designations, qualifications, limitations or restrictions on shares of First Interstate’s preferred stock, including
dividend rights, terms of redemption, conversion rights and liquidation, dissolution and winding-up preferences, in each case without
any action or vote by First Interstate’s shareholders.

One of the effects of undesignated preferred stock may be to enable First Interstate’s board of directors to discourage an attempt
to obtain control of First Interstate by means of a tender offer, proxy contest, merger or otherwise. The issuance of preferred stock may
adversely affect the rights of holders of First Interstate Class A common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock by, among
other things:
 

 •  restricting dividends on either or both classes of common stock;
 

 •  diluting the voting power of either or both classes of common stock;
 

 •  impairing the liquidation rights of either or both classes of common stock;
 

 •  delaying or preventing a change in control without further action by the shareholders; or
 

 •  decreasing the market price of either or both classes of common stock.

Meetings of Shareholders. First Interstate’s bylaws provide that annual meetings of First Interstate’s shareholders will be held at
such time as is determined by First Interstate’s board of directors to elect directors and for the transaction of any other business as may
come before the annual meeting. First Interstate’s articles of incorporation provide that special meetings of shareholders may be called
by (1) First Interstate’s board of directors, (2) the Chairman of First Interstate’s board of directors, (3) the Chief Executive Officer of
First

Table of Contents

Interstate, or (4) a holder, or a group of holders, of common stock holding more than 10% of the total voting power of the outstanding
shares of First Interstate capital stock then entitled to vote.

Advance Notice Provisions. First Interstate’s bylaws provide that nominations for directors may not be made by shareholders at
any special meeting thereof unless the shareholders intending to make a nomination notifies First Interstate of its intention a specified
number of days in advance of the meeting and furnishes to First Interstate certain information regarding itself and the intended
nominee. First Interstate’s bylaws also require a shareholder to provide written demand to the First Interstate secretary and must
describe the purpose for which the special meeting is to be held. Only business within the purposes described in the notice of the
meeting may be conducted at a special meeting. These provisions could delay shareholder actions that are favored by the holders of a
majority of First Interstate’s outstanding capital stock until the next shareholders’ meeting.

Filling of Board Vacancies. Unless First Interstate’s board of directors otherwise determines or is otherwise required by applicable
law, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by the
shareholders may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a
quorum of First Interstate’s board of directors, or by a sole remaining director. Each such director will hold office until the next election
of directors and until such director’s successor is elected and qualified.

Amendment of the First Interstate Articles of Incorporation. First Interstate’s articles of incorporation may be amended in the
manner allowed under the MBCA; however, the affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of: (1) a majority of the voting power of
the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock then entitled to vote thereon or (2) 66.67% of the voting power of the shares of
capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the shareholders meeting is required to amend or repeal the provision related
to the required shareholder approval in a Change in Control transaction or the provision related to amending the First Interstate articles
of incorporation.

If the proposal to amend and restate the articles of incorporation of First Interstate is approved and the merger is completed, the
amendment of any of the provisions in the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate relating to First Interstate
common stock, a Change in Control transaction or a Class B Acquisition Transaction will require the vote of 70% of the outstanding
shares of the First Interstate Class A common stock, voting separately as a class.

Amendment of the First Interstate Bylaws. First Interstate’s articles of incorporation provide that the First Interstate bylaws may
be adopted, altered, amended or repealed by First Interstate’s board of directors upon the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the
directors then in office. First Interstate’s articles of incorporation also provide that the bylaws may be adopted, amended, or repealed by
a majority of the voting power of the shareholders entitled to vote.

Change in Control. First Interstate’s articles of incorporation provide for certain voting thresholds needed to consummate a
change in control transaction (as defined in the First Interstate articles of incorporation). Accordingly, First Interstate will not be able to
consummate a change in control transaction without obtaining the greater of (1) a majority of the voting power of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock then entitled to vote on such transaction, voting together as a single class, and (2) 66.67% of the
voting power of the shares of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at a shareholders meeting called to consider such
transaction and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.

If the proposal to amend and restate the articles of incorporation of First Interstate is approved and the merger is completed, if
First Interstate proposes to engage in a change in control transaction in which holders of First Interstate Class A common stock and
First Interstate Class B common stock will receive different consideration, First Interstate will need to obtain, in addition to any
shareholder approval required by the MBCA and the First Interstate articles of incorporation, the approval of at least 70% of the
outstanding shares of First Interstate Class A common stock, voting separately as a single class.

Table of Contents

In addition, if the proposal to amend and restate the articles of incorporation of First Interstate is approved and the merger is
completed, if First Interstate proposes to merge into another corporation and in the twelve months before such merger the acquiring
company acquired any shares of First Interstate Class B common stock, then such merger transaction will require the affirmative vote
of 70% of the outstanding shares of First Interstate Class A common stock, voting separately as a single class, unless the holders of the
First Interstate Class A common stock and First Interstate Class B common stock receive the same consideration for their shares in the
merger and the merger consideration paid is at least equal to the highest amount paid by the acquiring corporation for the First
Interstate Class B common stock.

Transactions with Interested Shareholders. If the proposal to amend and restate the articles of incorporation of First Interstate is
approved and the merger is completed, First Interstate cannot merge with or sell any material assets to any shareholder of First
Interstate Class B common stock unless such transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested directors on First Interstate’s
board of directors and the holders of a majority of the shares of First Interstate Class A common stock, voting separately as a single
class.

No Cumulative Voting. The MBCA provides that shareholders are not entitled to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless
First Interstate’s articles of incorporation provide otherwise. First Interstate’s articles of incorporation prohibit cumulative voting.

Dual Class Structure

As discussed above, First Interstate Class B common stock is entitled to five votes per share, while First Interstate Class A
common stock is entitled to one vote per share. First Interstate Class A common stock is the class of stock to be issued to Cascade
shareholders in the merger and is the only class of First Interstate’s capital stock that is publicly traded. As of March 17, 2017,
members of the Scott family held 16,469,421 shares First Interstate Class B common stock and, therefore, controlled in excess of
59.8% of the voting power of First Interstate’s outstanding stock. As a result, the Scott family will be able to exert a significant degree
of influence or actual control over First Interstate’s management and affairs and over matters requiring shareholder approval, including
the election of directors, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of First Interstate’s assets and any other significant
transaction. This concentrated control will limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters and the interests of the
Scott family may not always coincide with First Interstate’s interests or the interests of other shareholders.

The transfer agent and registrar for First Interstate’s common stock is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC.

Restrictions on Ownership

Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve if any person (including a
company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire “control” of a bank holding company or a bank. An acquisition of “control” can
occur upon the acquisition of ten percent or more of the voting stock of a bank holding company or depository institution or as
otherwise defined by the Federal Reserve Board. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board has 60 days from
the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the
acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that so acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a
bank holding company.

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

The rights of shareholders of First Interstate are currently governed by First Interstate’s articles of incorporation, bylaws and the
MBCA. The rights of shareholders of Cascade are currently governed by Cascade’s articles of incorporation, bylaws and the Oregon
Business Corporation Act, which we refer to in this document as the “OBCA.” If the merger is completed, Cascade shareholders will
become First Interstate shareholders and their rights will likewise be governed by First Interstate’s articles of incorporation, as
amended and restated in accordance with First Interstate’s Proposal No. 2 (Approval and Adoption of the First Interstate Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation) and Cascade’s Proposal No. 3 (Non-Binding Vote to Approve the First Interstate Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation) beginning on pages 33 and 53, respectively, of this document, First Interstate’s bylaws, as amended
and restated in accordance with First Interstate’s Proposal No. 8 (Approval of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of First Interstate)
and the MBCA.

the approval and adoption of the amended and restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate. A copy of the proposed amended and
restated articles of incorporation of First Interstate is included as Annex D to this document.

The following summary is not a complete statement of the differences between the rights of Cascade shareholders and the rights
of First Interstate shareholders and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of each
corporation. Copies of First Interstate’s articles of incorporation and bylaws are on file with the SEC and are available on written

Board Structure and Composition

The size of the First Interstate board of directors must be at least five and not more than 18, in accordance with our bylaws. There
are currently 16 directors divided into three groups with staggered three-year terms on the First Interstate board of directors.

The First Interstate board of directors does not have a formal written policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in
identifying director nominees. The governance standards of the First Interstate board of directors, however, require the governance and
nominating committee of the First Interstate board of directors to review the qualifications of candidates to the full board of directors,
of which diversity is one of the criteria. This assessment includes the consideration of personal and professional ethics and integrity,
including a candidate’s reputation for integrity in the business community; diversity among the existing members of the board of
directors, including racial and ethnic background and gender; specific business experience and competence, including an assessment of
whether the candidate has experience in, and possesses an understanding of, business issues applicable to the success of the banking
industry and whether the candidate has served in policy-making roles in business, government, education or other areas that are
relevant to First Interstate’s regional activities; financial acumen, including whether the candidate, through education or experience, has
an understanding of financial matters and the preparation and analysis of financial statements; professional and personal
accomplishments, including involvement in civic and charitable activities; educational background; and whether the candidate has
expressed a willingness to devote sufficient time to carrying out his or her duties and responsibilities effectively and is committed to
service on the board of directors.

Controlled Company Exemptions

First Interstate qualifies as a “controlled company” under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules because members of the Scott family
control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a “controlled company,” First Interstate is eligible for
certain exemptions from the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements. Specifically, the First Interstate board of directors is not
required to have a majority of independent directors or a compensation or nominating committee composed entirely of independent
directors.

Director Independence

The First Interstate board of directors evaluates the independence of each director, including nominees for election to the First
Interstate board of directors, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and our corporate
governance guidelines, which are available on our website at www.FIBK.com. As a “controlled company” under the NASDAQ
Marketplace Rules, we are exempt from the requirement to have a majority of independent directors on our Board. The First Interstate
governance guidelines, however, require that a majority of First Interstate board members, including all members of the audit
committee, meet director independence standards under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.

The First Interstate board of directors has determined that the following ten directors are independent in accordance with such
standards:

 •  Steven J. Corning
 

 •  Dana L. Crandall
 

 •  David H. Crum
 

 •  William B. Ebzery
 

 •  Charles E. Hart, M.D.

 •  David L. Jahnke
 

 •  Ross E. Leckie
 

 •  Teresa A. Taylor
 

 •  Theodore H. Williams
 

 •  Peter I. Wold

Table of Contents

The First Interstate board of directors considers all relevant facts and circumstances in determining independence, including,
among other things, making an affirmative determination that the director has no material relationship with First Interstate directly or
as an officer, shareholder or partner of an organization that has a material relationship with First Interstate. In its determination of
independence, the First Interstate board of directors considered that First Interstate conducts banking and credit transactions in the
ordinary course of business with certain independent directors. See “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.” The Company
also purchases electrical services from an entity owned by Mr. Crum and employs in non-executive roles, family members of certain
directors. None of these transactions or relationships were deemed by the First Interstate board of directors to impair the independence
of any of these directors.

Separate Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Roles

The First Interstate board of directors has chosen to separate the roles of Chairman of the First Interstate board of directors and
the Chief Executive Officer, and it has appointed James R. Scott as Chairman of the First Interstate board of directors. We believe that
separating the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman best serves the current needs of First Interstate and our shareholders. The
Chairman manages the overall function of the First Interstate board of directors, and his current responsibilities include presiding at
meetings of the First Interstate board of directors; establishing the agenda for each meeting in consultation with the lead independent
director, our Chief Executive Officer and other senior management as appropriate; helping to establish, coordinate and review the
criteria and methods for evaluating, at least annually, the effectiveness of the First Interstate board of directors and its committees; and
exercising such other powers and duties as set forth in the First Interstate bylaws and as may from time to time be assigned to him by
the First Interstate board of directors. The separation allows Mr. Scott to focus on management of board of director matters and allows
our Chief Executive Officer to focus on the general supervision, direction, and control of our business affairs, and ensure that all orders
and resolutions of the First Interstate board of directors are carried into effect. Additionally, First Interstate believes the separation of
roles ensures the objectivity of the First Interstate board of directors in its management oversight role, specifically with respect to
reviewing and assessing the Chief Executive Officer’s performance.

Lead Independent Director

The lead independent director, a position currently held by Mr. Jahnke, serves as a liaison between the Chairman, management
and independent directors as well as between the Scott family and independent directors; calls and presides over meetings of the
independent directors no less than semi-annually and more often as appropriate; and, if requested by major shareholders or Scott family
members, is available for consultation and direct communication.

Board Meetings and Attendance

Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the First Interstate board of directors and each committee on which they serve, as
well as the First Interstate annual meetings of shareholders. In 2016, the First Interstate board of directors, as then constituted, met
seven times, with each serving director attending at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the First Interstate board of directors.
All of the continuing directors attended our 2016 annual meeting of shareholders.

Director Nomination, Selection and Qualifications

The governance and nominating committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating director nominees and recommending to
the First Interstate board of directors a slate of nominees for election at each annual meeting of shareholders. When formulating its
recommendations for director nominees, the governance and nominating committee considers recommendations offered by the Chief
Executive Officer, shareholders and any outside advisors the governance and nominating committee may retain. The Scott family,
through a family

council, recommends Scott family members to the governance and nominating committee for consideration as candidates for
membership on the board of directors. All current year nominees are standing for re-election to the First Interstate board of directors.
All candidates for membership to the First Interstate board of directors, including those recommended by the Scott family council, are
evaluated by the governance and nominating committee on the basis of broad experience, financial acumen, professional and personal
accomplishments, educational background, wisdom, integrity, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, understanding of the
First Interstate business environment and willingness to devote adequate time to board of director duties. The qualifications, attributes
and skills of each nominee, together with their business experience, led to the conclusion that each nominee is qualified to serve as a
director of First Interstate.

The Scott family does not approve candidates for board of director membership prior to their nomination by the governance and
nominating committee and there are no arrangements or understandings between any candidate and the Scott family that require
disclosure pursuant to Item 401(a) of Regulation S-K.

The First Interstate board of directors does not have a formal policy concerning shareholder recommendations of candidates for
board of director membership. It views that such a formal policy is not necessary given the procedures described above and its
willingness to consider candidates recommended by shareholders. First Interstate shareholders may recommend candidates by writing
to the First Interstate corporate secretary at the headquarters of First Interstate, 401 N. 31st Street, Billings, Montana 59101, giving the
candidate’s name, contact information, biographical data and qualifications. A written statement from the candidate consenting to be
named as a candidate and, if nominated and elected, to serve as a director should accompany any such recommendation. See
“Shareholder Proposals and Nominations” and “Shareholder Communications with the First Interstate Board.”

Board Committees and Related Matters

The First Interstate board of directors has six standing committees: governance and nominating, compensation, audit, credit,
executive, risk and technology improvement. In addition to these committees, the Chairman may from time to time designate and
appoint, on a temporary basis, one or more directors to assist in the form of a limited or special assignment in the performance or
discharge of any powers and duties of the full board of directors or any committee thereof.

The First Interstate board of directors makes committee and committee chair assignments annually at its meeting immediately
following the annual meeting of shareholders, although further changes may be made from time to time as deemed appropriate by the
full board of directors. Each committee has a board of director approved charter, which is reviewed annually by the respective
committee. Recommended changes, if any, are submitted to the full board of directors for approval. Each committee may retain and
compensate consultants or other advisors as necessary for it to carry out its duties. A copy of the charters for each standing committee
can be found on the First Interstate website at www.FIBK.com by selecting “Governance Documents.”

directors. In addition, the governance and nominating committee evaluates the performance of our Chairman and oversees the
functions and needs of the First Interstate board of directors and its committees, including overseeing the orientation and development
of members of the board of directors, evaluating the effectiveness of the board of directors, each committee and the respective
performance of each member of the board of directors, evaluating services provided to and communications with First Interstate
shareholders and reviewing and approving related party transactions. The governance and nominating committee also reviews each
committee’s annual objectives. The objectives of all committees are discussed in a meeting of the Chairman, lead director of the First
Interstate board of directors and each of the committee chairmen to increase the efficacy of the work of the First Interstate board of
directors and its committees. The governance and nominating committee met five times in 2016 with each serving committee member
attending at least 75% of the meetings.

Compensation Committee

Chair: Teresa A. Taylor
Additional Members: Steven J. Corning, David L. Jahnke and Randall I. Scott
Meetings Held in 2016: 6
Independence: Mr. Corning, Mr. Jahnke and Ms. Taylor are independent under applicable NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.
Compensation Committee Interlock and Insider Participation: No members of the compensation committee who served during
2016 were officers or employees of First Interstate or any of its subsidiaries during the year, were formerly First Interstate officers or
had any relationship otherwise requiring disclosure as a compensation committee interlock.

The compensation committee of the First Interstate board of directors has overall responsibility for reviewing and approving
corporate goals relevant to compensation for executive officers and evaluating the effectiveness of First Interstate’s compensation
practices in achieving its strategic objectives, encouraging behaviors consistent with its values and aligning performance objectives
consistent with its vision. The compensation committee evaluates the performance of the Chief Executive Officer, approves the
compensation of executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, and oversees succession planning for executive officers. The
compensation committee is also responsible for granting awards under First Interstate’s equity and incentive compensation plans and
reviewing the financial performance and operation of compensation programs affecting First Interstate employees generally. In
addition, the compensation committee recommends compensation for First Interstate board of director members. The compensation
committee met six times in 2016 with each serving committee member attending at least 75% of the meetings.

The compensation committee is required to have at least two members who qualify as either a non-employee director as that term
is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, or an outside director as that term is defined for purposes of Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We refer to all of these members collectively in this document as the “Outside Members.” All
awards granted to First Interstate officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, who we refer to in this document as
“Section 16 Officers,” that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code, unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee, are approved by its Outside Members. The compensation
committee has delegated authority to our Chief Executive Officer to make awards to employees who are not Section 16 Officers.

Compensation Consultant. The compensation committee has retained the services of Pearl Meyer and Partners, which we refer
to in this document as “PM&P,” a compensation consulting firm, to assist with its executive compensation review and to provide
competitive market data. A consultant from PM&P generally attends the compensation committee meetings at which executive officer
compensation is discussed and provides information, research and analysis pertaining to executive compensation and updates on
market trends as requested by the committee.

Table of Contents

In connection with its engagement of PM&P, the compensation committee considered various factors bearing upon PM&P’s
independence, including the amount of fees received by PM&P from First Interstate, PM&P’s policies and procedures designed to
prevent conflicts of interest, and the existence of any business or personal relationship that could impact PM&P’s independence. After
reviewing these and other factors, the compensation committee determined that PM&P was independent and that its engagement did
not present any conflicts of interest. PM&P does not provide executive compensation services to First Interstate.

The compensation committee sets compensation levels based on the skills, experience and achievements of each executive
officer, taking into account market analysis and input provided by PM&P and the compensation recommendations of the Chief
Executive Officer, except with respect to his own position. The compensation committee believes that input from both PM&P and the
Chief Executive Officer provides useful information and points of view to assist the committee in determining the appropriate
compensation.

Audit Committee

Chair: Ross E. Leckie
Additional Members: Dana L. Crandall, David H. Crum, Theodore H. Williams, Peter I. Wold
Meetings Held in 2016: 10

Rules.
Audit Committee Financial Literacy and Expertise: The First Interstate board of directors has determined that Ross E. Leckie
qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert,” as that term is defined in applicable SEC regulations.

The audit committee of the First Interstate board of directors represents and assists the board of directors in its oversight
responsibility relating to the quality and integrity of First Interstate’s financial statements and related internal controls; internal and
external audit independence, qualifications and performance; and the processes for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations.
The audit committee oversees the appointment, compensation and retention of the First Interstate independent registered public
accounting firm, including the performance of permissible audit, audit-related and non-audit services and the associated fees. The audit
committee has been responsible for reviewing First Interstate’s risk assessment and risk management policies. The audit committee
continues to be responsible for establishing procedures for the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns
regarding questionable accounting, reporting, internal control or auditing matters as well as monitoring compliance with ethics
programs. The audit committee met 10 times in 2016 with each serving committee member attending at least 75% of the meetings.
Mr. Wold joined the audit committee commencing with his appointment to the First Interstate board of directors in December 2016 and
attended 100% of the meetings of the committee subsequent to his appointment.

Interstate Bank management in the establishment of loan portfolio and credit policies that will assure the safety of depositors’ money,
earn sufficient income to provide an adequate return on capital and enable communities in our market area to prosper. The credit
committee met eight times in 2016 with each serving committee member attending at least 75% of the meetings.

and their implications for long-range planning. The technology committee met four times in 2016 with each serving committee
member attending at least 75% of the meetings.

Shareholder Communications with the First Interstate Board of Directors
 

First Interstate has not, to date, developed a formal process for shareholder communications with the First Interstate board of
directors. It is believed that the current informal process, in which any communication sent to the First Interstate board of directors
either generally or in care of the Chief Executive Officer, Corporate Secretary or other corporate officer or director is forwarded to all
members of the board of directors, has adequately served the board of director’s and shareholders’ needs in this respect.

Financial Code of Ethics
 

The First Interstate Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and principal accounting officers or other persons performing
similar functions are required to comply with our financial code of ethics for our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial
Officers.

The purposes of the financial code of ethics are as follows:

 •  to promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in SEC and public filings;
 

 •  to promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;
 

 •  to facilitate prompt internal reporting of violations of the financial code of ethics; and

First Interstate employees may submit concerns or complaints regarding ethical issues on a confidential basis by means of a toll-

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FIRST INTERSTATE

The compensation discussion and analysis describes our executive compensation program for the following 2016 executive
officers, which we collectively refer to in this document as the “Named Executive Officers”:
 

 •  Kevin P. Riley, President and Chief Executive Officer
 

 •  Marcy D. Mutch, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 

 •  William D. Gottwals, Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer
 

 •  Kevin J. Guenthner, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer
 

 •  Stephen W. Yose, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer

2016 Performance
 

First Interstate’s year was driven by solid performance, improved efficiency and the successful acquisition and integration of
Flathead Bank of Bigfork, a $254 million financial institution operating in markets in our current footprint. In 2016, we saw stable loan
demand throughout our markets and our loan growth was well-balanced across all of our commercial and consumer portfolios, with
total loan growth of 4.4% year-over-year. Our deposit base increased 3.9% year-over-year, ending 2016 at just over $8 billion. We
closed the year by announcing our agreement to acquire Cascade, a $3.1 billion financial institution. This will be a transformative
acquisition, which will take us across the $10 billion threshold and expand our footprint into the faster growing markets of Oregon,
Idaho and Washington. We also acquired the rights to the First Interstate Bank name, which allows us to expand our strong brand into
new markets across the United States. This is particularly exciting as we look forward to our integration with Cascade and the
geographic, strategic, financial and cultural benefits this acquisition will provide.

In 2016, we reported earnings of $95.6 million, or $2.13 per diluted share. Earnings levels were driven by loan growth, stable
credit quality, increased revenues from fee-based products and continued improvement in our efficiency ratio. During 2016, we
recorded litigation recoveries of $4.2 million, which were partially offset by acquisition-related expenses of $2.8 million. Exclusive of
litigation recoveries, acquisition-related expenses and net investment securities gains, our 2016 earnings were $94.6 million, or $2.11
per diluted share, compared to $90.3 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, a 6.6% increase year over year in earnings per share.

We have consistently reported positive earnings to shareholders for the last 29 years, and have paid consecutive quarterly
dividends for over 22 years. During 2016, we increased quarterly dividends by 10% to $0.22 per common share and announced an
additional 9% increase in quarterly dividends to $0.24 per common share during first quarter 2017. The increase in our stock price,
combined with our strong dividend, resulted in total shareholder return of 49.4% in 2016, as compared to 7.62% in 2015.

Our strong 2016 performance was driven by our focus on people, processes and technology. During 2016, we supplemented our
already strong leadership team with a number of dynamic leaders in key roles. Leadership across First Interstate is united in support of
each of our stakeholders - our employees, our customers, our shareholders and our communities.

With this strong team in place, we pursued improving our processes. We implemented a new credit process, a new mortgage
accounting process, a new accounts payable process and many others. We renewed our strategic plan and developed a road-map for its
implementation. In addition, several of our departments underwent assessments to ensure we have the proper structures in place to be
scalable as we continue to grow.

To further enable our people and processes, we leveraged technology to complement our growth goals. During 2016, we
introduced a new digital banking platform and implemented new financial reporting and budgeting software, a new general ledger and
accounts payable system and a new human resources system.

To promote a culture that aligns the interests of management with those of our shareholders, our 2016 executive compensation
program focused on an appropriate mix of fixed and variable compensation as illustrated in the charts below.
 

   

Factors Considered in Determining Executive Compensation
 
Compensation Consultant and Management

The compensation committee approves our compensation structure, policy and programs to ensure we have in place appropriate
executive officer incentives and employee benefits. Outside Members annually review and determine the salary, short-term incentives
and long-term equity incentives awarded to our Chief Executive Officer, approve all executive officers’ compensation, and approve the
total dollar value of equity awards for all other officers, taking into consideration non-binding recommendations from non-outside
members, market analysis, input by the compensation committee’s independent compensation consultant and the recommendations of
our Chief Executive Officer, except with respect to his own position.

Role of Compensation Consultants/Peer Group Market Analysis

We use comparative executive officer compensation data publicly disclosed by a peer group of public companies in addition to
compensation survey data to evaluate the competitiveness of our executive officer compensation and to guide the compensation for
newly hired executive officers. During 2016, and extending through 2017, the compensation committee engaged the services of PM&P,
a compensation consulting firm, to assist with our executive compensation review and to provide competitive market data. PM&P
performed a comprehensive review of our executive compensation in 2016 by obtaining proxy data based on PM&P’s recommended
peer group, which includes banking organizations with asset size, geography and operational and business model characteristics similar
to ours. The peer group was composed of the following banks:
 

BancFirst Corporation   Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
BancorpSouth, Inc.   International Bancshares Corporation
Banner Corporation   National Penn Bancshares
Chemical Financial Corporation   NBT Bancorp, Inc.
Columbia Banking System, Inc.   Old National Bancorp
First Commonwealth Financial Corporation   Park National Corporation
First Financial Bancorp   Renasant Corporation
First Merchants Corporation   Simmons First National Corporation
First Midwest Bancorp, Inc.   Trustmark Corporation
Glacier Bancorp, Inc.   United Community Banks, Inc.

  WesBanco, Inc.

Changes to the peer group from the previous year include the addition of Columbia Banking System, Inc., First Commonwealth
Financial Corporation and Simmons First National Corporation, who were added based on

their asset size, operating revenues, market capitalization and business models. IberiaBank Corporation, F.N.B. Corporation and United
Bankshares, Inc. were removed from the peer group due to their large size characteristics relative to ours.

The compensation committee exercises its business judgment and discretion in determining executive compensation and
generally targets market competitive (50th percentile) base pay, incentives and total cash compensation within the peer group.

Analysis of Executive Officer Compensation
 
Base Salaries

The Outside Members approved the 2016 base salary of Mr. Riley, our current Chief Executive Officer, and approved the 2016
compensation of other executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, as recommended by our Chief Executive Officer.
Increases to base salary ranged from 2.0% to 18.0% in 2016, and were based on the compensation committee’s review of market data
from our peer group defined above.

The following table shows the 2016 base salary of each Named Executive Officer.

Short-Term Incentives

Our executive officers are eligible for annual cash-based short-term incentives under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The
Compensation Committee sets the value of the short-term incentive award as a percentage of an executive’s base salary. Varying short-
term incentive award percentages reflect the Compensation Committee’s belief that an executive officer’s scope of work,
responsibilities and performance all be considered when awarding incentives. Award opportunities are established at threshold, target
and maximum levels. The maximum level of each metric is capped at 150% of target. The pay-out percentage will be interpolated on a
linear basis, except that the pay-out percentage will equal 0% for a ranking below the minimum of 50% of target. The 2016 short-term
incentive plan awards for the Named Executive Officers were based on First Interstate performance, which was measured by core net
income, core efficiency ratio and customer metric goals. These measures were aligned with the operating objectives of First Interstate’s
business, with 100% of the award based on First Interstate’s overall performance and each executive officer’s accomplishments
measured against individual performance plan objectives. Short-term incentives payouts for First Interstate in 2016 were 95.01% of
target.

accomplishments against his performance plan. In determining Mr. Riley’s additional performance award, the compensation
committee took into consideration his successful recruitment of an executive leadership team capable of managing a greater than
$10 billion financial institution, his prominent role in implementing First Interstate’s operational and strategic plans and his efforts
in promoting First Interstate’s vision, mission, values and commitments to community.

(2) Ms. Mutch received a 2016 short-term incentive payout of $123,000, which included $115,152, or 95.01% of Ms. Mutch’s target
short-term incentive, based on First Interstate performance and an additional $7,848 based on Ms. Mutch’s individual
accomplishments against her performance plan. In determining Ms. Mutch’s additional performance award, the compensation
committee took into consideration her leadership in the successful implementation of two new accounting systems to enhance
financial reporting and fully-automate accounts payable processing.

(3) Mr. Gottwals received a 2016 short-term incentive payout of $93,000. Mr. Gottwal’s short-term incentive payout would have been
$114,012, or 95.01% of Mr. Gottwal’s target short-term incentive, based on First Interstate performance; however, this amount
was reduced by $21,012 based upon Mr. Gottwal’s individual accomplishments against his performance plan objectives.

(4) Mr. Guenthner received a 2016 short-term incentive payout of $93,000, which included $87,033, or 95.01% of Mr. Guenthner’s
target short-term incentive, based on First Interstate performance and an additional $5,967 based on Mr. Guenthners’s individual
accomplishments against his performance plan. In determining Mr. Guenthner’s additional performance award, the compensation
committee took into consideration his leadership in the successful implementation of the First Interstate’s mobile and digital
banking platform.

(5) Mr. Yose received a 2016 short-term incentive payout of $110,000, which included $75,533, or 95.01% of Mr. Yose’s pro-rated
target short-term incentive, based on First Interstate performance and an additional $34,467 based on Mr. Yose’s individual
accomplishments against his performance plan. In determining Mr. Yose’s additional performance award, the compensation
committee took into consideration his implementation of a disciplined, guideline-driven approach in managing the First
Interstate’s loan portfolio.

Long-Term Incentives

We believe long-term equity incentive compensation encourages employees to focus on our long-term performance. Long-term
incentives in the form of equity compensation also provide an opportunity for executive officers and certain designated key employees
to increase their equity ownership in First Interstate, further aligning their interests with those of our shareholders.

In 2016, long-term incentives awarded to the Named Executive Officers included an equal mix of performance vested and time
vested restricted stock. The Chief Executive Officer’s long-term incentive award is equal to approximately 50% of his base salary, and
the remaining Named Executive Officers’ long-term incentive awards are equal to approximately 40% of their base salaries. The value
of the long-term incentive awards to our officers, including the Named Executive Officers, is based primarily on the individual’s ability
to influence First Interstate’s long-term growth and profitability.

Time vested restricted stock awards have a three-year graded vesting period. Performance vested restricted stock awards vest in
varying percentages based upon First Interstate’s performance relative to that of a peer group comprised of the SNL Financial Index of
bank holding companies with total assets between 50% and 200% of our December 31, 2016 total assets, which we refer to in this
document as the SNL Index. During 2016, vesting percentages ranged from 0% to 200% of target and were based on First Interstate’s
three-year return on average assets, three-year return on average equity and the three-year average total shareholder return. The
adjustment percentage is interpolated on a linear basis, except that the adjustment percentage will equal 0% for a ranking below the
35th percentile. The measurement date for 2016 performance vested restricted stock awards is December 31, 2018 using the previous
12 quarters’ performance.

Vesting is as follows:
 

Percentile Ranking   
Adjustment
Percentage  

Below 35th percentile    0% 
35th to < 50th percentile    50-100% 
50th to < 75th percentile    100-200% 
75th percentile or higher    200%

Table of Contents

All awards under our equity compensation plan are based on the closing price of the underlying Class A common stock as quoted
on NASDAQ Global Select Market for the last market trading day prior to the date of the award. Dollar values of the annual awards of
long-term incentives to executives have historically been approved at the Compensation Committee’s regularly scheduled meeting in
January with the date of the awards specified at that time.

Upon his appointment as Chief Credit Officer effective April 4, 2016, Mr. Yose was awarded 7,080 shares of time vested
restricted stock. In addition, during 2016, certain performance vested restricted shares awarded to executive officers in 2014 vested at
101% based upon achievement of pre-defined performance objectives. During 2016, Mr. Riley received 2,988 performance vested
restricted shares, Ms. Mutch received 206 performance vested restricted shares, and Mr. Guenthner received 1,400 performance vested
restricted shares.

Comprehensive Benefits Package

We provide a competitive benefits package to all full-time employees, including the Named Executive Officers, that includes
health and welfare benefits, such as medical, dental, vision care, disability insurance and life insurance benefits, and a 401(k) savings
plan. We also provide a profit sharing plan for all non-temporary employees under which contributions are made as authorized by the
First Interstate board of directors. Participants vest in profit sharing amounts after three years of service.

We provide a non-qualified deferred compensation plan under which eligible participants may defer a portion of their base salary
or short-term incentives subject to certain maximums as set forth by the plan administrator. Additionally, we make discretionary
contributions on behalf of the executive officer participants for 401(k) plan matching contributions and profit sharing contributions in
excess of the Internal Revenue Code limitations. Other contributions on behalf of a participant may be made at the discretion of the
First Interstate board of directors.

We have obtained life insurance policies covering selected officers of our banking subsidiary, First Interstate Bank, including
certain of our Named Executive Officers. Under these policies, we receive benefits payable upon death of the insured. An endorsement
split dollar agreement or survivor income benefit agreement has been executed with each of the insureds whereby a portion of the death
benefit or a lump-sum survivor benefit is payable to the insured’s designated beneficiary if the participant is employed by us at the time
of death.

Perquisites

Perquisites offered to the Named Executive Officers may include payment of social club dues and the use of a company
automobile.

Severance and Change-in-Control Benefits

We provide severance pay and other benefits to executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, whose employment
is terminated, including through involuntary termination by us without cause and, in some cases, voluntary termination by the
executive for good reason. These arrangements provide security of transition income and benefit replacements that allow such
executives to focus on our prospective business priorities that create value for shareholders. We believe the level of severance and
benefits provided by these arrangements is consistent with the practices of our peers and are necessary to attract and retain key
employees. Potential payments and benefits available under these arrangements are discussed further under “Potential Payments upon
Termination or Change of Control.” Other than Mr. Riley, our Named Executive Officers are not entitled to any payment resulting
from a change in control.

Other Matters
 
Tax Considerations

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows an income tax deduction to public companies for annual
compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the chief executive officer and the three other

Table of Contents

most highly compensated named executive officers (excluding the chief financial officer). Compensation that qualifies as
“performance-based” or satisfies another exception is excluded for purposes of calculating the amount of compensation subject to the
$1 million limit. The compensation committee considers tax and accounting consequences in developing and implementing our
executive compensation program and believes that compensation paid under our management incentive plans is generally fully
deductible for federal income tax purposes.

Securities Trading Policy

Our insider trading policy prohibits our directors and employees from trading in our securities during certain designated blackout
periods and otherwise while they are aware of material non-public information, and from engaging in hedging transactions or short
sales and trading in puts and calls with respect to our securities. The policy also discourages holding our securities in a margin account
or pledging our securities as collateral for a loan.

Clawback Provisions

In 2011, based on the compensation committee’s recommendation, the First Interstate board of directors approved a clawback
policy for all Section 16 reporting officers, including the Named Executive Officers. The clawback policy authorizes the Board to
recoup all performance-based compensation paid during the years affected by a financial restatement or executive misconduct. Based
upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement, the First Interstate board of directors may also direct First Interstate to
cancel any equity-based awards granted to the executives during the applicable time period and recoup any gains realized during the
time period with respect to equity-based awards.

Stock Ownership Guidelines

In order to further align the interests of the employees with the interests of First Interstate, the First Interstate board of directors
approved a stock ownership guideline policy whereby each executive officer is expected to acquire and maintain ownership of our
common stock equal in value to a specified multiple of the executive officer’s base salary.

The policy recommends the following stock holdings for our Named Executive Officers:
 
   Stock Ownership Guideline
Chief Executive Officer   Five (5) times base salary
Named Executive Officers (excluding Chief Executive Officer)   Three (3) times base salary

Stock holdings are measured at the end of each year using the year’s closing stock price. Each Named Executive Officer is
expected to meet the ownership guidelines by the later of January 1, 2017 or five years from the date he or she became a named
executive officer. Mr. Guenthner has met the recommended level of stock ownership. All other Named Executive Officers have until
September 23, 2020 at the earliest, to meet the recommended levels of stock ownership.

Equity Granting Practices

The First Interstate board of directors, based on the recommendation of the compensation committee, adopted the 2015 Equity
Incentive Plan pursuant to which the compensation committee (or a subcommittee thereof) approves equity awards to certain officers,
including the Named Executive Officers. Awards are granted to advance the interests of our shareholders by enhancing our ability to
attract, retain and motivate employees and directors who are expected to make important contributions to us by providing them with
both equity ownership opportunities and performance-based incentives intended to align their interests with those of our shareholders.
The compensation committee has delegated authority to First Interstate’s Chief Executive Officer, subject to certain terms and
limitations as established by the compensation committee, to make awards to employees who are not Section 16 officers. For additional
information regarding our equity compensation plans, see “Equity Compensation Plans.”

Results of Shareholder Advisory Approval of Named Executive Officer Compensation

At the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders, shareholders were asked to approve, on an advisory basis, the named executive officer
compensation for 2014 as reported in our 2015 proxy statement. This say-on-pay proposal was approved by over 96% of the shares
present and entitled to vote. The compensation committee considered the results of the 2015 advisory vote along with shareholder input
and other factors discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and concluded that no changes to our compensation policies
and practices were warranted in response to the shareholder advisory vote.

Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs

The Compensation Committee designs our compensation programs to encourage appropriate risk taking while discouraging
behavior that may result in unnecessary or excessive risk. In this regard, the following elements have been incorporated in our
compensation programs for executive officers:
 

☑ Use of multiple metrics in annual incentive plan and use of two long-term incentive vehicles for executive officers
 

☑ Each short-term incentive award metric capped at 150%
 

☑ Performance-based share awards capped at 200%
 

☑ Time-based share awards vest ratably over three years
 

☑ Emphasis on long-term and performance-based compensation
 

☑ Formal clawback policies applicable to both cash and equity compensation
 

☑ Alignment of interests of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our shareholders through stock ownership
guidelines that call for significant share ownership

The compensation committee periodically reviews with management an assessment of whether risks arising from First Interstate’s
compensation policies and practices for all employees are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on First Interstate, as well
as the means by which any potential risks may be mitigated, such as through governance and oversight policies. Based on its most
recent assessment, the compensation committee concluded that our compensation policies and practices for all employees do not create
risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on First Interstate.

Compensation Committee Report
 

The compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” required by Item 402(b)
of Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussions, the compensation committee recommended to the
First Interstate board of directors that the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” be included in this document and be incorporated
by reference into the First Interstate’s 2016 Form 10-K.

performance shares based on average return on assets, return on equity and total shareholder return performance at the 51st to
60th percentile, which would entitle the Named Executive Officers to receive 100% of the performance restricted shares awarded,
or the target shares. The maximum vesting for the performance awards is 200% of the target shares for 2016 and 150% of target
shares for 2015 and 2014, if average return on assets, return on equity and total shareholder return are at or above 76% percentile
of the SNL Index for 2014, 2015 and 2016. The 2014 performance restricted stock awards vested at 101% of target on

Equity Compensation Plans
 

First Interstate has equity awards outstanding under two stock-based compensation plans; the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, which
we refer to in this document as the 2015 Plan, and the 2006 Equity Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, which we refer to in
this document as the 2006 Plan. These plans were primarily established to enhance First Interstate’s ability to attract, retain and
motivate employees.

The 2015 Plan, approved by First Interstate’s shareholders in May 2015, was established to provide us with flexibility to select
from various equity-based performance compensation methods, and to be able to address changing accounting and tax rules and
corporate governance practices by optimally utilizing performance based compensation. The 2015 Plan did not increase the number of
shares of common stock available for awards under the 2006 Plan.

The 2006 Plan, approved by First Interstate’s shareholders in May 2006 and May 2014, was established to consolidate into one
plan the benefits available under all other than existing share-based award plans, which, collectively with the 2006 Plan, we refer to in
this document as the Previous Plans. The Previous Plans continue with respect to awards made prior to May 2015.

The 2015 Plan contains the following important features:
 

☑ The maximum number of shares of First Interstate Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan was
2,000,000, which was approximately 9.2% of the previously-existing First Interstate Class A common stock outstanding at the
time of shareholder approval.

 

☑ The 2015 Plan prohibits the repricing of awards without shareholder approval.
 

☑ The 2015 Plan prohibits the recycling of shares.
 

☑ Awards under the 2015 Plan are subject to broad discretion by the compensation committee administering the 2015 Plan.
 

☑ All awards under the 2015 Plan are based on the closing price of the underlying Class A common stock as quoted on NASDAQ
Global Select Market for the last market trading day prior to the date of the award.

The following terms apply to equity awards granted for each of the last three years:
 

 •  Time-restricted awards - three-year graded vesting period; and
 

 
•  Performance-restricted awards - cliff vesting as of December 31st of the third year following the year of the award, based on

achievement of specified performance conditions.

2016 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
 

First Interstate has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which we refer to in this document as the “Deferred
Compensation Plan,” established for the benefit of a select group of management and highly compensated employees, including
Named Executive Officers. Under the terms of our Deferred Compensation Plan, eligible employees, as determined by our board of
directors or compensation committee, may defer a portion of base salary or short-term incentives subject to certain maximums as set
forth by the plan administrator. Deferral elections are made by eligible executives during the last quarter of each year for amounts to be
earned in the following year. We make discretionary contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan on behalf of the executive
officer participants for 401(k) plan matching contributions and profit sharing contributions in excess of Internal Revenue Code
limitations. Other contributions on behalf of a participant may be made at the discretion of the First Interstate board of directors.

The deferral account of each participant is adjusted by investment earnings or losses based upon the performance of the
underlying investments selected by the participant from among alternatives selected by the plan administrator. Benefits under the
Deferred Compensation Plan are generally not paid until the beginning of the year following the participant’s retirement or termination
from First Interstate. Benefits can be received either as a lump sum payment or in annual installments based on the executive’s election
made at least one year prior to retirement. The distribution elections are all made in accordance with Section 409A.

The following table shows the contributions, earnings and aggregate balance of total deferrals by our Named Executive Officers
as of December 31, 2016.

2016 Other Compensation
 

We provide our Named Executive Officers with other compensation that the compensation committee believes is reasonable and
consistent with the overall compensation program to better enable us to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. The
compensation committee annually reviews the levels of other compensation provided to named executive officers.

The named executive officers participate in the following plans and programs along with health and group life and disability
insurance. Additional benefits offered to the Named Executive Officers may include some or all of the following:
 

 •  individual life insurance, as described below under “Survivor Income Benefits”;
 

 •  payment of social club dues;
 

 •  dividends on unvested restricted stock; and
 

 •  use of a company automobile.

Survivor Income Benefits
 

We obtained life insurance policies on selected officers of First Interstate Bank. Under these policies, we receive all benefits
payable upon death of the insured. A survivor income agreement was executed with each of the insured officers whereby a survivor
benefit of $150,000 is payable to designated beneficiaries if the participant is employed by us at the time of death. We have entered
into this type of survivor income agreement with Mr. Riley and Mr. Guenthner.

Retirement and Related Plan
 

We maintain a profit sharing plan for all non-temporary employees. Contributions are made as authorized by the First Interstate
board of directors. Participants vest after three years of service. In addition, employees are permitted to defer a portion of their
compensation into our profit sharing plan under a 401(k) feature, and we make limited matching contributions with respect to such
deferrals.

Chief Executive Officer Total Compensation
 

The Outside Members reviewed all components of the Chief Executive Officer’s total compensation package. Mr. Riley was
appointed as First Interstate’s President and Chief Executive Officer on September 23, 2015. The compensation paid to Mr. Riley
during his tenure as Chief Executive Officer was determined to be reasonable based on the review of our peers’ chief executive officer
total compensation data. Mr. Riley’s compensation package was larger than those granted to our other executives in recognition of the
increased level of responsibility and performance required of our Chief Executive Officer.

As part of its role, the compensation committee reviews and considers the deductibility of executive compensation under Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides that we may not deduct compensation of more than $1,000,000 that is paid to
certain individuals unless certain conditions are met. We believe that compensation paid under the management incentive plans is
generally fully deductible for federal income tax purposes.

Employment Agreements
 

Upon his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer, First Interstate entered into an employment agreement with
Mr. Riley. Under the terms of the employment agreement, Mr. Riley is entitled to annual base

Table of Contents

compensation of $525,000, subject to periodic review and adjustment, the one-time award of 10,818 shares of First Interstate’s time-
restricted Class A common stock vesting one-third on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date and additional
benefits as are customarily offered to First Interstate’s executives, including paid time off, health insurance, pension, 401(k) and profit
sharing plans or benefits, use of a company car and a social club membership.

Mr. Riley’s employment agreement provides for the establishment of a non-qualified defined contribution supplemental executive
retirement plan, which became effective on January 1, 2016. The supplemental executive retirement plan provides for annual year-end
contributions equal to 20% of Mr. Riley’s base salary and performance-contingent contributions of up to an additional 20% of base
salary dependent upon achievement of established performance goals as determined by the compensation committee. Both annual
contributions and performance-contingent contributions to the supplemental executive retirement plan are 0% vested until the fourth
anniversary of the date of establishment, at which time the balance will become 50% vested. The supplemental executive retirement
plan will vest 10% per year thereafter and become fully vested on the ninth anniversary of the date of establishment. The supplemental
executive retirement plan is adjusted for investment earnings or losses based upon the performance of the underlying investments
selected by Mr. Riley from among alternatives selected by the plan administrator.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control
 

The amount of compensation payable to the Named Executive Officers upon voluntary termination, retirement, involuntary
not-for-cause termination, termination following a change of control and in the event of disability or death of the executives is
explained below. The amounts included below are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to the Named Executive Officers
upon voluntary termination, retirement, involuntary not-for-cause termination or termination following a change of control assuming
that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2016 and, thus, includes amounts earned through such time. The actual amounts
to be paid out can only by determined at the time of separation.

Payments Made Upon Termination
 

Regardless of the manner in which a Named Executive Officer’s employment is terminated, he or she is entitled to receive
amounts earned during his or her term of employment. Such amounts include:
 

 •  salary;
 

 
•  grants and awards received under our equity plans, subject to the vesting and other terms applicable to such grants

and awards;
 

 •  amounts contributed and vested under our profit sharing plan and deferred compensation plan; and
 

 •  unused paid time off.

In its discretion, the First Interstate board of directors, or the Chief Executive Officer (except with regard to any payments made
on his behalf) may authorize payment of additional separation amounts for the Named Executive Officers. The First Interstate board of
directors may also accelerate the vesting of any unexercisable stock options or restricted stock awards outstanding at the time of
termination. The amounts regarding applicable salaries, stock options, restricted stock awards, short-term incentives and deferred
compensation for the most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 are contained in the various tables included above.

Severance Payments
 

Except for the benefits listed under the heading “Payments Made Upon Termination” above, the Named Executive Officers are
not entitled to any other severance benefits.

Payments Made Upon Retirement
 

In the event of retirement, the Named Executive Officers would be entitled to the benefits listed under the heading “Payments
Made Upon Termination” above.

Payments Made Upon Death
 

In the event of death, in addition to the benefits listed under the heading “Payments Made Upon Termination” above, the estates
or other beneficiaries of the Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive benefits under our group life insurance plan equal to the
lesser of (1) 2.5 times their respective base salary or (2) $300,000. For all Named Executive Officers, the applicable amount would be
$300,000.

An additional $150,000 of survivor income benefit pursuant to life insurance policies covering selected officers of First Interstate
Bank is available to the beneficiaries of Mr. Riley and Mr. Guenthner should death occur while they are employed by First Interstate.

Payments Made Upon Disability
 

In the event of disability, in addition to the benefits listed under the heading “Payments Made Upon Termination” above, the
Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive benefits under our group disability plan which generally provides for 60% of
pre-disability earnings up to a maximum of $13,000 per month. For each of the Named Executive Officers, the applicable amount
would be $13,000 per month.

Payments Made Upon a Change of Control
 

Mr. Riley’s employment agreement contains change in control provisions entitling Mr. Riley to cash severance equal to 1.5 times
base salary plus target bonus at the time of resignation or in effect immediately preceding the change in control, whichever amount is
higher, if he is involuntarily terminated or resigns for good reason during the six months prior to or in the twenty-four months
following a change in control of First Interstate. This amount is payable in 18 monthly installments commencing on the 60th day after
the termination date or 60 days after the change in control is effective, whichever is later. This arrangement does not include any gross-
up for excise tax imposed as a result of severance or other payments made in connection with a change in control. As of December 31,
2016, Mr. Riley would be entitled to change in control payments of $1,363,000. Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Riley, are
not entitled to any payment resulting from a change in control.

In addition, the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan contains double trigger change in control provisions under which awards to
participants, including the Named Executive Officers, are subject to accelerated vesting if the participant is involuntarily terminated or
resigns for good reason during the twenty-four months following a change in control of First Interstate.

Director Compensation
 

First Interstate uses a combination of cash and stock-based incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to
serve on the First Interstate board of directors. In setting director compensation, First Interstate considers the significant amount of time
that directors expend in fulfilling their duties as well as the skill level required by First Interstate with respect to members of the board
of directors.

During 2016, each director, other than Mr. Riley, Thomas W. Scott and James R. Scott, received an annual retainer valued at
$46,750, with at least $21,750 of that being paid in the form of equity and the remaining $25,000 paid in the form of cash or First
Interstate Class A common stock at the director’s election.

Executive Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Board. James R. Scott received one-third of his retainer in the form of stock. These

providing an interface between the Board and our management, oversight of strategic planning, leadership of the Board, deployment
and the creation of shareholder value, executive succession planning and community visibility.

Directors are reimbursed for ordinary expenses incurred in connection with attending board and committee meetings. Directors
are also eligible for group medical insurance coverage at the director’s option. Under our Deferred Compensation Plan, directors may
elect to defer any cash portion of director’s fees until an elective distribution date or the director’s retirement, disability or death.

Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
 

Under the First Interstate stock ownership guidelines, each director is expected to acquire and maintain ownership of First
Interstate common stock equal in value to five times his or her annual cash retainer. Stock holdings are measured at the end of each
year using the year’s closing stock price. Each director is expected to meet the ownership guidelines within five years from the date he
or she became a director. All directors with the exception of one recently elected director have met the recommended levels of stock
ownership.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

Related Person Transaction Policy

The First Interstate board of directors has adopted a written related person transaction policy that is applicable to all First
Interstate executive officers, directors and certain entities and individuals related to such persons. The policy, as amended, generally
provides that First Interstate will not enter into any transactions with related parties unless such transaction(s) are (1) reviewed after
disclosure of the relevant facts and circumstances, including any benefits to First Interstate and the terms of any comparable products
or services provided by unrelated third parties and (2) determined to be in the best interests of First Interstate and its shareholders, as
approved by the independent directors of the governance and nominating committee of the First Interstate board of directors. The
policy also provides that the chairman of that committee, who is an independent director, has delegated authority to approve these
transaction(s) in certain circumstances, subject to ratification by the independent directors of the governance and nominating
committee. The policy does not apply to loan and credit transactions to directors and executive officers that are covered by Regulation
O adopted by the Federal Reserve.

All of the ongoing related party transactions described below were reviewed and approved by the independent directors of the
governance and nominating committee in accordance with the policy.

Related Party Transactions

First Interstate conducts banking transactions in the ordinary course of business with related parties, including directors, executive
officers, shareholders and their associates, on the same terms as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with
unrelated persons and that do not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.

Certain executive officers, directors and greater than 5% shareholders of First Interstate and certain entities and individuals
related to such persons, incurred indebtedness in the form of loans, as customers, of $53.3 million as of December 31, 2016. During
2016, new loans and advances on existing loans of $16.5 million were funded and loan repayments totaled $11.2 million. These loans
were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans
with persons not related to First Interstate.

First Interstate leases an aircraft from an entity wholly-owned by Thomas W. Scott, a greater than 10% shareholder and the
former chairman of the First Interstate board of directors who retired in January 2016. Under the terms of the lease, First Interstate pays
a fee for each flight hour plus certain third party operating expenses related to the aircraft. During 2016, total fees and operating
expenses of $108,000 were paid by First Interstate for the use of the aircraft. In addition, First Interstate leases a portion of its hanger
and provides pilot services to the related entity. During 2016, First Interstate received payments from the related entity of $53,000 for
hanger use, pilot fees and reimbursement of certain third party operating expenses related to Mr. Scott’s personal use of the aircraft.

First Interstate also leases an aircraft from an entity wholly-owned by James R. Scott, the Chairman of our the First Interstate
board of directors. Under the terms of the lease, First Interstate pays a fee for each flight hour plus certain third party operating
expenses related to the aircraft. During 2016, total fees and operating expenses of $121,000 were paid by First Interstate for use of the
aircraft. In addition, First Interstate leases a portion of its hanger and provides pilot services to the related entity. During 2016, First
Interstate received payments from the related entity of $19,000 for hanger use, pilot fees and reimbursement of certain third party
operating expenses related to Mr. Scott’s personal use of the aircraft.

First Interstate also leases an aircraft from an entity owned 66% by Jonathan R. Scott, a director and employee and Thomas W.
Scott. Under the terms of the lease, First Interstate pays a fee for each flight hour plus certain third party operating expenses related to
the aircraft. During 2016, total fees and operating expenses of $175,000 were paid by First Interstate for use of the aircraft.

James R. Scott, Thomas W. Scott, four other directors, namely Charles M. Heyneman, James R. Scott, Jr., Jonathan R. Scott and
Randall I. Scott, and two greater than 5% shareholders, John M. Heyneman, Jr. and Homer A Scott, Jr., each has a 2.5% interest in
Scott Family Services, Inc., which is referred to in this document as “SFS” and that provides professional services that benefit First
Interstate and the Scott family. In addition, Randall I. Scott is the chairman of the board of directors of SFS. Services provided for the
benefit of First Interstate include shareholder education and communication, strategic enterprise planning and corporate governance
consultation. During 2016, we paid $100,000 for these services. SFS reimburses First Interstate for all salaries, wages and employee
benefits expenses incurred by First Interstate on its behalf for personnel.

Conflict of Interest Policy

On an annual basis, each director and executive officer is obligated to complete a director and officer questionnaire that requires
disclosure of any transactions with First Interstate in which the director or executive officer, or any member of his or her immediate
family, have a direct or indirect material interest. Under the First Interstate code of personal conduct, all employees, including
executive officers, are expected to avoid conflicts of interest. Pursuant to our code of ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and senior
finance officers, such officers are prohibited from engaging in activities that are or may appear to be a conflict of interest unless a
specific, case-by-case exception has first been reviewed and approved by the First Interstate board of directors. All of the First
Interstate directors are subject to governance standards that include a code of ethics and conduct guide requiring the directors to avoid
conflicts of interest.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of the
outstanding common stock of First Interstate, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of
the common stock and other equity securities of First Interstate. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are
required by SEC regulations to furnish copies to First Interstate of all Section 16(a) forms they file with respect to First Interstate
equity securities.

To the knowledge of First Interstate, during the year ended December 31, 2016, the First Interstate directors, executive officers
and greater than 10% shareholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements with the following exceptions: a Form 4
reporting one transaction of Jonathan R. Scott, a director, was inadvertently filed late, a Form 4 reporting one transaction of Kevin J.
Guenthner, an executive officer, was inadvertently filed late and two Forms 4 reporting two gift transactions of William B. Ebzery, a
director, were filed late.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS

First Interstate

The rules of the SEC permit shareholders of a company, after timely notice to the company, to present proposals for shareholder
action in the company’s proxy statement where such proposals are consistent with applicable law, pertain to matters appropriate for
shareholder action and are not properly omitted by company action in accordance with the SEC’s proxy rules. Our 2018 annual
meeting of shareholders is expected to be held on or about May 24, 2018, and proxy materials in connection with that meeting are
expected to be mailed on or about April 4, 2018. The deadline for submission of shareholder proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under
the Exchange Act for inclusion in the First Interstate proxy statement for the First Interstate 2018 annual meeting of shareholders is
December 14, 2017, which is 120 days before the anniversary of the mailing date of this document.

Additionally, under the terms of the First Interstate bylaws, shareholders who wish to present an item of business at the 2018
annual meeting must provide notice to the corporate secretary at the First Interstate principal executive offices not later than the close
of business on the 90th day, nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day, prior to May 25, 2017, which will be the one-year
anniversary of the 2016 First Interstate annual meeting of shareholders. If First Interstate does not receive notice of a shareholder
proposal in advance of such date, such proposal will be considered untimely and the persons named in proxies solicited by the First
Interstate board of directors for the First Interstate 2018 annual meeting of shareholders may exercise discretionary voting power with
respect to such proposal.

Cascade Bancorp

Cascade intends to hold an annual meeting during the year ending December 31, 2017 only if the merger is not completed.

Shareholders who, in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, wished to present proposals for consideration for inclusion in
the proxy materials to be distributed in connection with the annual meeting must have submitted their proposals so that they were
received by the Secretary of Cascade at Cascade’s main office at 1100 N.W. Wall Street, Bend, Oregon 97703 no later than the close of
business (5:00 p.m. local time) on December 14, 2016.

Table of Contents

For a proper shareholder proposal submitted outside of the process provided by Rule 14a-8 to be eligible for presentation at the
meeting, written notice must be received by the Secretary of Cascade at the address included above, not less than 60 days nor more
than 90 days before the date of the meeting (for a June 6, 2017 meeting, no earlier than March 8, 2017, and no later than the close of
business on April 7, 2017); provided, however, that if less than 65 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is
given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be received by the Secretary of Cascade, in writing, by the
close of business on the 15th day following the day on which such notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting
was made, whichever first occurs. A shareholder’s notice to the Secretary will set forth (1) a brief description of the matters desired to
be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (2) the name and record address of the
shareholder, (3) the class and number of shares of Cascade common stock that the shareholder owns or is entitled to vote and (4) any
material interest of the shareholder in such matters.

Shareholder recommendations for potential directors must be in writing and the shareholder submitting a nomination must have
continuously held at least $2,000 in market value of Cascade common stock for at least one year and hold the stock through the date of
the annual meeting at which the nomination will be made. Any shareholder who intends to nominate a director at an annual meeting
must deliver notice to Cascade’s Secretary in accordance with the time periods set forth in the paragraph above. The shareholder notice
must include, for each nominee, the name, age, business address and residence address of the nominee, the principal occupation or
employment of the nominee, the number of Cascade shares beneficially owned by the nominee, and other information that would be
required under the rules of the SEC in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of the nominee. Additional information is
required with respect to the shareholder giving the notice. The Cascade Governance Committee requires evidence that the nominee’s
qualifications meet the criteria and considerations as outlined in the Governance Committee Charter or as published by Cascade from
time to time. Refer to the Governance Committee Charter, available on Cascade’s website www.botc.com (click on “About Us,”
“Investor Information” and then “Governance Documents” on the left side of the page), and Cascade’s Bylaws for minimum
qualifications of director candidates and procedures for shareholders in communicating nominations to the Board. Cascade’s Bylaws

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 17, 2016 (this “Agreement”), by and between Cascade Bancorp, an
Oregon corporation (the “Company”), and First Interstate BancSystem, Inc., a Montana corporation (“Parent”).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which
the Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Parent (the “Merger”), so that Parent is the
surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Corporation”) in the Merger;

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have adopted and approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have resolved to recommend that
the shareholders of each of Parent and the Company, respectively, approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted
as a “plan of reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354, 356 and 361 of the Code;

WHEREAS, this Agreement constitutes a “plan of merger” within the meaning of the MBCA and OBCA;

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement for each party to enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company and
Parent have simultaneously herewith entered into voting agreements substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (each, a
“Voting Agreement,” and collectively, the “Voting Agreements”) in connection with the Merger; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements specified in this Agreement in
connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Montana Business
Corporation Act (the “MBCA”) and the Oregon Business Corporation Act (the “OBCA”), at the Effective Time, the Company shall
merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under
the laws of the State of Montana. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall terminate.

1.2 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will
take place by mail or electronic delivery, or by mutual agreement of the parties, at the offices of Luse Gorman, PC, at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern Time, on a date which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law)
of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the “Closing Date.”

Table of Contents

1.3 Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the parties shall execute,
and Parent shall cause to be filed articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Montana (the “Montana Secretary”) and
the Secretary of State of the State of Oregon (the “Oregon Secretary”) and, as applicable, plans of merger, to the extent required by the
relevant provisions of the MBCA and of the OBCA, respectively (collectively, the “Articles of Merger”). The Merger shall become
effective at such time as designated in the Articles of Merger, or as otherwise agreed by the parties. The term “Effective Time” shall be
the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles of Merger.

1.4 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable
provisions of the MBCA and the OBCA.

1.5 Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e) and as noted below, each share of the common stock, no par value, of the Company issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Company Common Stock”), except for the Cancelled Shares, shall be
converted into the right to receive, without interest, (i) 0.14864 shares (the “Exchange Ratio,” and such shares, the “Stock
Consideration”) of the Class A common stock, no par value per share, of Parent (the “Parent Common Stock”) and (ii) $1.91 in cash
(the “Cash Consideration,” together with the Stock Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”); it being understood that upon the
Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.6, the Parent Common Stock, including the shares issued to former holders of Company
Common Stock, shall be the common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and
each certificate (each, an “Old Certificate,” it being understood that any reference herein to an “Old Certificate” shall be deemed to
include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the Merger
Consideration, including without duplication, cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), and
(ii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), in each case, upon the
surrender of such Old Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2 and without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or
distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration to give
holders of Company Common Stock and Parent the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
provided, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to permit Parent or the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities or otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are directly owned by the Company or Parent (in each
case, other than shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or the Company in respect of debt previously
contracted or held in a fiduciary capacity) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such cancelled shares, the “Cancelled Shares”).

(d) In accordance with Section 60.554 of the OBCA, no dissenters’ rights shall be available to the holders of Company
Common Stock in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Table of Contents

1.6 Parent Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of Parent Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

1.7 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common Stock granted by the
Company (a “Company Option”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, subject to Parent’s
receipt of an option surrender agreement in the form set forth in Section 1.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, the holder shall
be entitled to receive, on the Closing Date, a cash payment, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, with respect thereto
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time. “Merger Consideration Value” means the sum of (A) the
Cash Consideration and (B) the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio times (2) the Parent Share Closing Price. If the per share exercise
price of a Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration Value, such Company Option shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration.

(b) Company Restricted Stock Awards. At the Effective Time, each award of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
vesting or repurchase granted by the Company that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Company
Restricted Stock Award”) shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Restricted Stock Award, without interest.

(c) Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards. At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock granted by the Company (a “Company RSU Award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and, subject to Parent’s receipt of an RSU surrender agreement in the form set forth in Section 1.7(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, the holder shall be entitled to receive on the Closing Date, a cash payment, without interest and less
applicable withholding taxes, with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration Value. “Merger
Consideration Value” has the same meaning as provided in Section 1.7(a).

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company and its Compensation
Committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 1.7.

1.8 Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of
Parent (the “Parent Articles”), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, subject to the approval by the shareholders of
Parent by the Requisite Amendment Vote, be amended and restated as set forth in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto (the “Articles
Amendment”), and as so amended and restated shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter duly
amended in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable law.

1.9 Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Parent (the “Parent Bylaws”), as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter duly amended in
accordance with the terms thereof and applicable law.

1.10 Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a “plan of reorganization” for the purposes of
Sections 354, 356 and 361 of the Code.

1.11 Bank Merger. Immediately following the Merger, Bank of the Cascades (“Company Bank”), an Oregon stock
bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, will merge (the “Bank Merger”) with and into First Interstate Bank (“Parent
Bank”), a Montana state-chartered commercial bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Parent Bank shall be the surviving
entity in the Bank Merger (the “Surviving Bank”) and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of Company Bank
shall cease. The parties agree that the Bank Merger shall become effective immediately after the Effective Time. Promptly after the
date of this Agreement, Parent Bank and Company Bank will enter into an agreement and plan of merger in form and substance agreed
to by Parent and the Company, which shall be customary for mergers similar to the Bank Merger (the “Bank Merger Agreement”). The
Company shall cause Company Bank, and Parent shall cause Parent Bank, to execute such articles of merger and such other documents
and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (“Bank Merger Articles”) immediately following the Effective
Time.

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange
Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) certificates or, at Parent’s
option, evidence of shares in book-entry form, representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (collectively, referred to herein as
“New Certificates”), to be delivered to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5, and (b) cash in an amount
equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares required to be paid to holders of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Article II (such New Certificates and cash, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”).

2.2 Exchange of Shares.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Article I, (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent (the “Letter of
Transmittal”) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for New Certificates
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and the Cash Consideration
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive
pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon
proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by a
properly completed Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check
representing the amount of (A) the Cash Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has
the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and
(C) any dividends or distributions which the holder presenting such Old Certificate or Old Certificates has the right to receive pursuant
to this Section 2.2, and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration, dividends or distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old

Table of Contents

Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in
respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Old Certificate until such holder shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the
surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares
of Parent Common Stock that the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the
right to receive.

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof
that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required
for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than to settle transfers of
such Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as
provided in this Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to
Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall
pay in accordance with Section 2.2(a) to each former holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive
such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing price per
share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the consecutive period of twenty (20) full
trading days ending on the fifth day immediately preceding the Closing Date (or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company) (the “Parent Share Closing Price”) by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest
one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.5. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not
separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock for six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any former holders of Company Common Stock who have
not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates in compliance with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions
on the Parent

Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for
any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to

Company Equity Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which the deduction and withholding was
made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond
in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement, and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b).

(i) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all
determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of any Letter of Transmittal and
compliance by any holder of Company Common Stock with the procedures and instructions set forth herein and therein, (ii) the
issuance and delivery of the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedules delivered by the Company to Parent concurrently herewith (the “Company
Disclosure Schedules”); provided that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its
absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere inclusion of an item
in the Company Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the
Company that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in
a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article III shall be deemed to qualify (a) any other
section of Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (b) other sections of Article III to the extent it is reasonably
apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific reference or cross-reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such other sections the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Oregon, and is a bank
holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). The Company has the

and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement,
the term “Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, any
effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had a
material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of
such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (provided, however, that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall
not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
or applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or
Governmental Entities, including changes in Federal or state tax laws, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional
political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the financial
services industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (D) changes, after the date hereof, in
prevailing interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit or United States capital markets conditions, or other financial, economic or
monetary conditions in the United States or elsewhere, in each case affecting the financial services industry generally and not
specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, (E) changes proximately caused by the public disclosure or consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (provided that this exception shall not apply for purposes of the representations and warranties in
Section 3.3(b) or Section 4.3(b)) or actions or omissions expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken or omitted to be taken
with the express prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (F) any failure by
a party to meet internal or published projections, forecasts, performance measures, operating statistics or revenue or earnings
predictions for any period (it being understood that the underlying facts and circumstances giving rise to such failure may be deemed to
constitute, and may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be, a Material
Adverse Effect if such facts and circumstances are not otherwise excluded pursuant to clauses (A)-(E) of this definition); except, with
respect to subclauses (A), (B), (C) or (D), to the extent that the effects of such change are disproportionately adverse to such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies similarly situated in the industry in which such party and its
Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement,
the word “Subsidiary” when used with respect to any person, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank or
other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or person of which (i) such first person directly or indirectly owns or
controls at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the
board of directors or others performing similar functions or (ii) such first person is or directly or indirectly has the power to appoint a
general partner, manager or managing member or others performing similar functions. True and complete copies of the Articles of
Incorporation of the Company (the “Company Articles”) and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the “Company
Bylaws”), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company to Parent.

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a “Company Subsidiary”) (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good
standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its
business requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected, either individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary
of the Company to pay dividends or distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on
dividends or distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of the Company
that is an insured depository institution are

ownership thereof. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on which
shareholders of the Company may vote, and no trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of the Company are issued or

denominated performance-based awards described in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules (the “LTI Awards”), there
are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements obligating the Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any shares of capital stock or other
voting securities or equity interests. Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true, correct and complete list of
all Company Equity Awards and LTI Awards outstanding as of the date hereof specifying, on a holder-by-holder basis, as applicable,
(A) the name of each holder, (B) the number of shares subject to each such Company Equity Award (or, in the case of an LTI Award,
the dollar value of the award that would be earned at threshold, target and maximum levels of performance), (C) the grant date of each
such Company Equity Award or LTI Award, (D) the vesting schedule for each Equity Award, (E) the Company Benefit Plan under
which such Company Equity Award or LTI Award was granted, (F) the exercise price for each such Company Equity Award that is a
Company Option, and (G) the expiration date for each such Company Equity Award that is a Company Option. Other than the
Company Equity Awards and the LTI Awards, no equity-based awards (including any cash awards where the amount of payment is
determined in whole or in part based on the price of any capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) are outstanding. No
Subsidiary of the Company owns any capital stock of the Company.

(b) Other than the Voting Agreements and as set forth on Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, there are no
voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or similar agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in effect
with respect to the voting or transfer of the Company Common Stock or other voting securities or equity interests of the Company or
granting any shareholder or other person any registration rights. The Company does not have in effect a “poison pill” or similar
shareholder rights plan.

(c) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
ownership interests of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances and security
interests whatsoever (“Liens”), and all of such shares or equity ownership

interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to bank Subsidiaries, as provided
under 12 U.S.C. §55 or any comparable provision of applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. No Company Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
voting security or equity interest of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of capital stock or any other voting security or equity interest of such Subsidiary.

3.3 Authority; No Violation.

(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger have been duly
and validly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the
Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and has
directed that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the shareholders of the Company for
consideration and approval at a meeting of such shareholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect and recommending
that the shareholders of the Company approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Except for the adoption and
approval of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the “Requisite Company Vote”) and the adoption and approval of the Bank Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby (including the Bank Merger) by the Board of Directors of Company Bank and the Company as its sole shareholder, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting insured depository institutions or
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies (the “Enforceability Exceptions”). Immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company has amended and restated the Company Bylaws in the form
attached as Exhibit C hereto.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any
provision of the Company Articles or the Company Bylaws or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in
Section 3.4 are duly obtained and/or made, as applicable, (x) violate any law, statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,

with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause (y) above) for such
violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

3.4 Consents and Approvals. Except for (a) the filing of applications, filings and notices, as applicable, with the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) under the BHC Act and approval of such

the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis.

except where the failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except for normal examinations
conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, no Regulatory
Agency has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of the Company, investigation into the business or operations of the

respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal and not material in
nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the
notes thereto. The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects
in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Since
December 31, 2013, no independent public accounting firm of the Company has resigned (or informed the Company that it intends to
resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of the Company as a result of or in connection with any disagreements
with the Company on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for liabilities (i) that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016
(including any notes thereto), (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2016, or
(iii) incurred in connection with or expressly contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, which would not reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the Company and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored,
maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company (x) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”)) to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
the Company’s outside auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to the Company’s
auditors and audit committee. There is no reason to believe that the Company’s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and
chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
director, officer, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise has had or
obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation

Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice.

proceeding pending or, to its Knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary (1) that involves a
Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency, or (2) that, individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to the Company, could
(A) have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or (B) be reasonably likely to prevent or delay it from performing its obligations
under, or consummating the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.

(b) Except as could not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, there is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction imposed upon the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates).

3.10 Taxes and Tax Returns.

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax
Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete
in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file
any material Tax Return (other than extensions to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course). All material Taxes of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other third party. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax, which waiver or extension
remains in effect. The federal income Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all years to and including 2012 have been
examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment
under applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has expired. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice of assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any material amount of Taxes, and there are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any
material Tax of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company has made available
to Parent true, correct and complete copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or gain recognition agreements with
respect to Taxes requested or executed in the last six (6) years. Neither the Company nor any of

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with
its terms and the requirements of all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) and all material filings, disclosures and
notices required by applicable laws, including ERISA, the Code, HIPAA and ACA, have been timely made or any interest, fines,
penalties or other impositions for late filings have been paid in full, if due. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take action, with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
subject the Company to a material unpaid Tax or penalty imposed by either Chapter 43 of the Code or Sections 409 or 502 of ERISA.

correction program of the IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, and

program.

(d) Section 3.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedules identifies each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a “Company Qualified Plan”). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter or
advisory opinion with respect to each Company Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor has
revocation been threatened) or such Company Qualified Plan is a volume submitter or prototype plan covered by an IRS advisory or
opinion letter affording reliance equivalent to a determination letter, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no existing
circumstances and no events have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur that could adversely affect the qualified status of any
Company Qualified Plan or the related trust or the reliance by the Company on any such IRS advisory or opinion letter or increase the
costs relating thereto. Section 3.11(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedules identifies each trust funding any Company Benefit Plan
and whether that purports to be a voluntary employee benefit association (each, a “VEBA””). Each such VEBA has received an
exemption letter from the IRS that the form of such VEBA satisfies the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9), which letter has not
been revoked (nor has revocation been threatened), and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no existing circumstances and no
events have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur that could adversely affect the continued exemption of such VEBA or
increase the costs relating thereto.

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a “nonqualified deferred compensation plan” (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the
Code) and any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has (i) since January 1, 2005, been
maintained and operated, in all material respects, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1 and
(ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

defined pursuant to Section 409A of the Code) of the underlying Company Common Stock on the date of grant.

(f) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has sponsored, maintained or
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to (i) any plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430 or
4971 of the Code, (ii) any plan that is a “multiemployer plan” within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a “Multiemployer
Plan”) or (iii) any plan that has two (2) or more contributing sponsors at least two (2) of whom are not under common control, within
the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a “Multiple Employer Plan”), and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor any
Company ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or
partial withdrawal (as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan.

(g) Except as provided in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.11(g), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors,
has sponsored or has any obligation with respect to, any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement that provides for
any post-employment or post-retirement health, medical, disability or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees or
beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as

the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of the Company, including the Company’s financial statements, as
applicable, to the extent required by GAAP.

(i) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims (other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to the Company’s Knowledge, no set of
circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof
with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans that
could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the “PBGC”), the IRS, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan, any
participant in a Company Benefit Plan, or any other party.

(j) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor any Company ERISA Affiliate nor any other person, including any
fiduciary, has engaged in any “prohibited transaction” (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could
subject any of the Company Benefit Plans or their related trusts, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any Company ERISA Affiliate
or any person that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any material Tax or penalty imposed under
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

(k) Except as disclosed in Company Disclosure Schedule 3.11(k), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the
vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer,
director or other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust,
except as provided in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an “excess parachute
payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes
to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause or require the Company
or any of its Affiliates to establish or make any contribution to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle.

(l) No Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code,
or otherwise. Company Disclosure Schedule 3.11(l) sets forth true, correct and complete copies of Section 280G calculations (whether
or not final) with respect to any disqualified individual in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and has also made
available a schedule of all termination benefits that would be payable to the individuals identified thereon, under all employment,
change in control agreements, severance arrangements or policies, supplemental executive retirement plans, deferred bonus plans,
deferred compensation plans, salary contribution plans or any other material non-qualified compensation arrangement maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of officers, employee or directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
assuming their employment or service is involuntarily terminated without cause on July 1, 2017, and the Closing Date occurs on such
date and based on other assumptions specified in the schedule.

consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016
(including any notes thereto), (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2016, or
(iii) incurred in connection with or expressly contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, which would not reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and
operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its
Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within those entities as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Parent’s outside auditors and the audit committee of Parent’s Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent’s internal
controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to Parent’s auditors and audit committee.
There is no reason to believe that Parent’s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to
give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any director,
officer, auditor, accountant or representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise has had or obtained
knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals)
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no
attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Parent or any committee thereof or to the Knowledge of Parent, to any

case of Parent, (ii) fail to make the Company Board Recommendation, in the case of the Company, or the Parent Board
Recommendation, in the case of Parent, in the Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) fail to publicly, definitively and without qualification
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in the case of the Company, or the Parent Board Recommendation, in the case of
Parent, within three (3) business days after the other party’s written request (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the
Company Meeting or the Parent Meeting, as applicable) or (iv) with respect to the Company and the Company Board of
Directors, adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal or fail to publicly, definitively and without
qualification issue a press release recommending against an Acquisition Proposal, within ten (10) business days after an
Acquisition Proposal is made public (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the Company Meeting), or publicly
propose to do any of the foregoing (each of the actions in clauses (i)–(iii), with respect to the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, and clause (iv), with respect to the Company, a “Recommendation Change”).

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to and in compliance with Section 6.12, prior to receipt of the Requisite
Company Vote, in the case of the Company, or the Requisite Parent Vote, in the case of Parent, the Board of Directors of the
Company or Parent, after consultation with its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor,
determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to
continue to make the Company Board Recommendation or the Parent Board Recommendation, as the case may be, to its
shareholders (and, in the event such determination is made by the Board of Directors of the Company in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company has taken into account the expected timing of and regulatory
conditions related to such Acquisition Proposal), the Company or Parent and its respective Board of Directors, as the case may be,
may submit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to its respective shareholders without recommendation or
otherwise effect a Recommendation Change (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Company or Parent and its respective Board of Directors, as the case may be, may
communicate the basis for its Recommendation Change to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; provided, that neither party nor its Board of Directors may take
any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives the other party at least five (5) business days’ prior written notice of its intention
to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action
(including, in the event such action is taken by the Company or its Board of Directors in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the
latest material terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or
modification thereof, including unredacted copies of any such Acquisition Proposal or other materials received in connection with
or correspondence relating to, such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, (ii) during such notice
period the Company or Parent and its Board of Directors, as the case may be, and its Representatives negotiate in good faith with
the other party and its Representatives any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by such other party and (iii) at
the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed in writing by the other party prior to the expiration of such notice period, and after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless continue
to be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to make the Company
Board Recommendation or Parent Board Recommendation, as the case may be. Any change to the financial or other material
terms of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material change to the event or circumstances

giving rise to the applicable Board of Directors’ determination to effect a Recommendation Change during a notice period, will be
deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal or a new such event or circumstance, as applicable, for purposes of this Section 6.3 and
will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3, except that the notice period shall be three (3) business days.

(c) Parent or the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the Company Meeting, as the case may be, if, as
of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Class
B Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company or Parent, as
applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote,
in the case of the Company, or the Requisite Parent Vote or Requisite Amendment Vote, in the case of Parent; provided, that
nothing herein shall prevent Parent or the Company from adjourning or postponing the Parent Meeting or the Company Meeting,
as the case may be, to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the Board of Directors of Parent or the Company has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is
necessary under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by such
shareholders prior to the Parent Meeting or the Company Meeting, as the case may be.

6.4 Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 and Section 6.3, each of Parent and the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries
with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is advisable or
required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall file with the NASDAQ a notification form for the listing of all shares of
Parent Common Stock to be delivered as Merger Consideration prior to the Effective Time.

6.6 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof (the “Continuation
Period”), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be
employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
immediately following the Effective Time (collectively, the “Continuing Employees”), while employed by Parent and its Subsidiaries
after the Effective Time, with compensation and employee benefits that are substantially comparable to the compensation and
employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that any cash incentive
compensation payable or earned in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be pro-rated to reflect the short year. Each
Continuing Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated by Parent or its Subsidiary during the Continuation Period for the
reasons listed in the Company’s Severance Policy set forth in Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules) and who is not
subject to an employment, change in control or other agreement that provides for the payment of severance, shall be entitled to receive
severance payments and benefits determined in accordance with the Company’s Severance Policy as in effect on the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that such Continuing Employee enters into a written release of claims against Parent in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Nothing contained in this Section 6.6 shall be construed to limit or terminate the rights of employees,
officers or directors of the Company under individual agreements with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause any employee benefit
plans sponsored or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate following the Effective Time (collectively, the “Parent Plans”) to recognize the service of each Continuing
Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor thereto) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and level of benefits (for purposes of vacation, paid time off and sick leave policies) under such Parent Plans; provided that
such recognition of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of any Parent Plan that is a defined benefit retirement plan or any Parent
Plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Employee with respect to the same
period of service, (iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits
or participation or (iv) entitle a Continuing Employee to be credited with more than one hundred twenty (120) hours of vacation, paid
time off and sick leave (collectively, “PTO”) on the Closing Date and to rollover more than eighty (80) hours of PTO from one
calendar year to a subsequent calendar year. With respect to any Parent Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits,
for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
(A) cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be waived with respect to such
Continuing Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, (B) credit each Continuing Employee for any co-payments
or deductibles incurred by such Continuing Employee in such plan year for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-
pocket expense requirements under any such Parent Plan, and (C) cause such credited expenses to also count toward any annual or
lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, or any Subsidiary
or Affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Company, Parent or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except as provided in written
agreements with such employees, directors, or consultants. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or
modify any Company Benefit Plan, Parent Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or
(ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
particular Company Benefit Plan, Parent Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time except as provided in Section 6.6(a) and (b) above. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person other than the parties hereto, including
without limitation any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

(d) Effective as of the day preceding the Effective Time, and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, the Company
shall adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to cause the Company 401(k) Plan to be terminated (the “Plan Termination Date”) and
the accounts of all participants and beneficiaries in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the Plan Termination Date to become fully vested as
of the Plan Termination Date. The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the resolutions and/or plan amendments evidencing
that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated in accordance with its terms. The form and substance of such resolutions and any
necessary amendments shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company
shall deliver to Parent an executed copy of such resolutions and any necessary amendments as soon as practicable following their
adoption by the Board of Directors of the Company and shall fully comply with such resolutions and any necessary amendments. The
Surviving Corporation shall take all other actions necessary to complete the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, including filing a

Form 5500 that arise after the Effective Time. Parent agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to permit 401(k) Plan
participants who become Continuing Employees to roll over their account balances in the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k)
Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.6(d) to the contrary, employees of the Company who continue employment with the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall be eligible as of the Effective Time to participate in the Parent
401(k) Plan; it being agreed that there shall be no gap in participation in a 401(k) Plan.

(e) The Company shall obtain from each of the individuals named in Section 6.6(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedules an
agreement, as of the date and in the form set forth in Section 6.6(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedules, stipulating the estimated
amount that each such individual is to receive as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any employment
agreement or change in control agreement, as applicable, (the aggregate amounts of such payments to be specified in Parent Disclosure
Schedule 6.6(e)).

(f) For a period of six (6) months following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide all employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries whose employment was terminated other than for cause, disability or retirement at or following the Effective Time, and
who so desires, job counseling and outplacement assistance services, in which it shall assist such employees in locating new
employment and shall notify all such employees who want to be so notified of opportunities for positions with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for which Parent reasonably believes such persons are qualified and shall consider any application for such positions
submitted by such persons, provided, however, that any decision to offer employment to any such person shall be made in the sole
discretion of Parent, provided, further that the total costs expended for such job counseling and outplacement assistance services shall
not exceed $150,000 in the aggregate.

(g) Parent shall establish a retention bonus pool in an amount as provided in Parent Disclosure Schedule 6.6(g) for
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries jointly designated in writing by Parent and the Company (other than employees of the
Company who are subject to employment contracts or other contracts providing for severance) to help retain key employees. The
amount and payment date of the retention bonus for each such employee shall be jointly determined in writing by Parent and the
Company, but in the aggregate shall equal the amount provided in Parent Disclosure Schedule 6.6(g) assuming all such key employees
remain with the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate to such date or are involuntarily terminated without cause prior to
that date.

(h) The Company shall take all such actions as Parent may reasonably request to fully and timely comply with any and all
requirements of both federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (“WARN Act””) and any state-specific
WARN Act statutes, including providing notices to the Company and Company Bank’s employees.

6.7 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company Articles, the Company Bylaws or comparable governing documents or any indemnification
agreement in effect as of the date hereof (and shall also advance expenses as incurred to the extent provided under the Company
Articles, Company Bylaws or comparable governing documents any such indemnification agreements as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement), each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, in such capacity)
(collectively, the “Company Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments,
fines, losses, amounts paid in settlement, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time,
arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to any
matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this

Agreement or the enforcement of the Surviving Corporation’s obligations under this Section 6.7; provided, that the Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under applicable law.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided, that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be obligated to expend, in the
aggregate, an amount in excess of 250% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance
(the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation’s good faith determination, provide
the maximum coverage available at an annual premium not exceeding the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in
consultation with, but only upon the consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may (and at the
request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year “tail” policy
under the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence, if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the
Premium Cap.

(c) In the event that, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and other assets to any person, then, and in each case, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that such successors and assigns shall expressly assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.7.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified
Party and his or her heirs and representatives, each of whom is expressly made a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.7, and are in
addition to, and are not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have from
Parent, Parent Bank, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any other person by contract or otherwise.
The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Company Indemnified Party unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable law
(in which case such termination or modification shall only be permitted to the extent required by such law) or (y) the affected Company
Indemnified Party has consented in writing to such termination or modification.

6.8 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary
of the Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities
and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent. Effective as of and subject to the occurrence
of the Effective Time, Parent hereby expressly assumes the due and punctual performance and observance of each and every covenant
and condition in the contracts set forth on Section 6.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedules to be performed and observed by the
Company.

6.9 Advice of Changes. Parent and the Company shall each promptly advise the other party of any fact, effect,
change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development that (i) has had or is reasonably likely, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) would or would be

reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that
reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; provided, that
any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of
this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.9 shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies available
to the party receiving such notice.

6.10 Shareholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any shareholder litigation against the
Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall give Parent an
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the right to consult on the
defense and settlement with respect to such litigation, and the Company will in good faith take any comments of Parent into account,
and no such settlement that provides for a monetary payment to the shareholders and not covered by an insurance policy (other than the
payment of attorneys’ fees) shall be agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

6.11 Governance Matters.

(a) The directors of Parent at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
Effective Time until their successors are duly elected or appointed; provided, that prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all
actions necessary to cause two (2) current members of the Board of Directors of the Company, each of whom qualifies as an
independent director with respect to both the Company and Parent under the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC and the NASDAQ and each of whom shall be mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company, to be
appointed to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation effective at or immediately following the Effective Time.

(b) The officers of Parent at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
Effective Time until their successors are duly elected or appointed, together with such additional persons as may thereafter be elected
or appointed.

6.12 Acquisition Proposals.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.12, the Company agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and employees, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective agents, advisors, financing sources, investment bankers, attorneys and other representatives (collectively with officers,
directors and employees, “Representatives”), not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate inquiries or proposals regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person concerning any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) disclose or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or otherwise cooperate in any way
with, any person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal (including by affording access to the personnel, properties, books,
records or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries) or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, or other agreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than a confidentiality agreement referred
to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.12(a)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal (provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not prevent the Company or its Representatives from contacting any person who has made an Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or
proposal relating thereto solely for the purpose of seeking clarification of the terms and conditions thereof). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the

receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, it
may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, (x) furnish or cause to be furnished confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, (y) participate in negotiations or discussions with and (z) afford access to its and their personnel,
properties, books, records and assets to the person making the Acquisition Proposal (and such person’s Representatives) if and only if
its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; provided, further, that prior to providing any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant
to the foregoing proviso affording such access or participating in such negotiations or discussions, the Company shall have given
Parent at least twenty-four (24) hours’ prior written notice and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party
on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with
any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company. The Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other
than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will request pursuant to any applicable confidentiality agreements the return
or destruction of any information provided to any such person in connection therewith. The Company will promptly (and within
twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of and the identity of the person
making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal) and will provide Parent an unredacted copy of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and
any draft agreements, proposals or other materials received in connection with such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and will keep
Parent apprised of any related material developments, discussions and negotiations on a reasonably current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal (including providing an unredacted copy of such
amended or revised Acquisition Proposal and any further or revised draft agreements, proposals or other materials received in
connection with such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing
confidentiality agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms hereof. As used in this
Agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or
inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the consolidated assets of the Company, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer), exchange offer or other acquisition
of equity or voting securities that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more
of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from complying with
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or making any other disclosure to the
Company’s shareholders that the Company or its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would be more likely than not to result in a violation of applicable law; provided, that
such rules or other Law will in no way eliminate or modify the effect or consequences that any action pursuant to such rules would
otherwise have under this Agreement, and any public disclosure or statement by the Company or its Board of Directors in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Recommendation Change unless the Company and its Board of Directors
definitively and without qualification reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation and recommend against such Acquisition
Proposal in such disclosure or statement.

6.13 Public Announcements. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release with respect to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement shall be a release mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, each of the parties agrees that
no public release or announcement or statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by
any party without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as required by applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable Governmental Entity or stock exchange to

party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

structure of effecting the combination of the Company and Parent, if and to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, and the

restructuring; provided, however, that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger
Consideration or payment to or treatment of any Company Equity Awards provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax
treatment of the Merger with respect to the shareholders of the Company or of Parent pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) adversely affect
the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to the Company or Parent pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) impede or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, the
Requisite Company Vote, the Requisite Parent Vote or the Requisite Amendment Vote.

6.15 Takeover Statutes. None of the Company, Parent or their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action
that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and their respective Boards of Directors
will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the
validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

6.16 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). The Company and Parent agree that, to most effectively
compensate and retain those officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act (the “Company Insiders”), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the Company Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection
with the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.16. The Company shall deliver to Parent in a reasonably timely fashion prior
to the Effective Time accurate information regarding the Company Insiders, and the Board of Directors of Parent and of the Company,
or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act),
shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause (in
the case of Company) any dispositions of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards by the Company Insiders, and (in the
case of Parent) any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be
officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each
case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company Requisite Vote or Parent Requisite Vote:

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument;

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has
denied approval of the Merger or the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order, injunction, decree, or other legal restraint or prohibition
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the

herein;

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the one-year anniversary
of the date of this Agreement (the “Termination Date”), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure

Company shall have the option, each in its sole discretion, to extend the Termination Date for an additional six-month period;

termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or
in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Parent, or
Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by the Company, and which is not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice to the
Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, or by its nature or timing
cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date);

(e) by the Company, if Parent or the Board of Directors of Parent shall have (i) made a Recommendation Change, or
(ii) breached its obligations under Section 6.3 in any material respect;

Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

(h) by the Company at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Company Vote to enter into an agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, but only if (i) the Company’s Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such action would be more likely than not to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (ii) the Company has not materially breached its obligations under
Section 6.12.

8.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or
any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Sections 6.2(b) (Access to Information (Confidentiality)), Section 8.1 (Termination),
this Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination) and Article IX (General Provisions) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and
(ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, (i) a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or senior management of
the Company or has been made directly to the shareholders of the Company, or any person shall have publicly announced an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company, (ii) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (but only if (x) such Acquisition Proposal was made directly to the shareholders of the Company or
otherwise publicly announced prior to the Company Meeting and (y) the Company shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Company
Vote at the duly convened Company Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on the approval of this
Agreement was taken), (B) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or (C) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g)(ii), and
(iii) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or
consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to
above), then the Company shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement or the date of consummation of such
transaction, as applicable, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same-day funds, a fee equal to 3.75% of aggregate merger consideration, or
$22,097,579 (the “Termination Fee”); provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to “fifteen percent (15%)” shall instead refer to “fifty percent (50%).”

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(h), then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then Parent shall pay the
Company, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or
damages arising out of the other party’s willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement, in the event that this
Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 8.1, the maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or damages payable
by a single party under this Agreement shall be equal to the Termination Fee, and neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(f) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and the Company, respectively, would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either party fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the Termination
Fee or any portion thereof, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including attorneys’ fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to pay the amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate”
(as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be
made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that
such overdue amount is actually paid in full.

Board of Directors
First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.
401 North 31st Street
P.O. Box 30918
Billings, Montana 59116-0918

Members of the Board of Directors:

We understand that First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (the “Company”, “First Interstate”) intends to enter into a transaction (the
“Proposed Transaction”) with Cascade Bancorp (“Cascade”) pursuant to which: (a) Cascade will be merged with and into the Company
with the Company as the surviving corporation; (b) each share of the common stock, no par value, of Cascade (the “Cascade Common
Stock”) issued and outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive, (i) 0.14864 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of the Class A
common stock, no par value per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”) and (ii) $1.91 in cash (the cash and stock
consideration described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the
Proposed Transaction are set forth in more detail in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 17, 2016, between Cascade
and the Company (the “Agreement”). The summary of the Proposed Transaction set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the terms
of the Agreement.

We have been requested by the Board of Directors of the Company to render our opinion with respect to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the Company of the Consideration to be paid by the Company in the Proposed Transaction. We have not
been requested to opine as to, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the Company’s underlying business decision to proceed
with or effect the Proposed Transaction or the likelihood of consummation of the Proposed Transaction. In addition, we express no
opinion on, and our opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness of the Proposed Transaction to, or any consideration received
in connection therewith by, the holders of any class of securities or the amount or the nature of any compensation to any officers,
directors or employees of any parties to the Proposed Transaction, or any other class of persons, relative to the Consideration paid in
the Proposed Transaction or otherwise. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Proposed Transaction as compared to
any other transaction or business strategy in which the Company might engage.

In arriving at our opinion, we reviewed and analyzed: (1) a draft of the Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2016, and the
specific terms of the Proposed Transaction; (2) publicly available information concerning the Company and Cascade that we believe to
be relevant to our analysis, including their respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016; (3) (a) published estimates by
third party equity research analysts with respect to the future financial performance of the Company and adjusted by management of
the Company (as so adjusted, the “Company Research Estimates”) and generally available third party data regarding certain third party
securities held and certificates of deposit owed by Cascade, (b) financial and operating information with respect to the business,
operations and prospects of Cascade furnished to us by the Company, including financial projections of Cascade prepared by
management of Cascade (the “Cascade Financial Projections”) and reviewed and adjusted by management of the Company (as so
adjusted, the “Company’s Cascade Projections”) and (c) certain financial and operating information with respect to the business,
operations and prospects of the Company, including a presentation of the Company Research Estimates

on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Proposed Transaction prepared by management of the Company based on the Company
Research Estimates and the Cascade Financial Projections (the “Pro Forma Estimates”); (4) a trading history of the Company Common
Stock from November 11, 2015 to November 11, 2016 and a trading history of the Cascade Common Stock from November 11, 2015
to November 11, 2016; (5) a comparison of the historical financial results and present financial condition of the Company and Cascade
and with those of other companies that we deemed relevant; (6) a comparison of the financial terms of the Proposed Transaction with
the financial terms of certain other recent transactions that we deemed relevant; and (7) the pro forma impact of the Proposed
Transaction on the future financial performance of the combined company, including cost savings, operating synergies and other
strategic benefits expected by the management of the Company to result from a combination of the businesses (collectively, the
“Expected Synergies”). In addition, we have had discussions with the management of the Company concerning the business,
operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition and prospects of the Company and of Cascade and have undertaken such other studies,
analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information
used by us without any independent verification of such information (and have not assumed responsibility or liability for any
independent verification of such information) and have further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that they
are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. Upon the advice and at the
instruction of the Company, we have assumed that the Company Research Estimates are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the
future financial performance of the Company and that the Company will perform in accordance with such estimates, and upon the
advice and at the instruction of the Company, we have relied on such estimates in performing our analysis and arriving at our opinion.
With respect to the Cascade Financial Projections, we have assumed that such projections have been reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Cascade as to the future financial performance of
Cascade and, upon the advice and at the instruction of the Company, we have assumed that the Company’s Cascade projections are a
reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial performance of Cascade and that Cascade would perform in accordance
with such projections. Furthermore, upon the advice and at the instruction of the Company, we have assumed that the amounts and
timing of the Expected Synergies are reasonable and that the Expected Synergies will be realized in accordance with such estimates.
With respect to the Pro Forma Estimates, upon the advice and at the instruction of the Company, we have assumed that the Pro Forma
Estimates are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial performance of the Company on a pro forma basis giving
effect to the Proposed Transaction, that the pro forma adjustments to the Company Research Estimates are appropriate and that the pro
forma Company will perform in accordance with such Pro Forma Estimates. We assume no responsibility for and we express no view
as to any such projections, synergies or estimates or the assumptions on which they are based. In addition, we are not experts in the
evaluation of loan portfolios or assessing the adequacy of the allowances for losses with respect thereto. We have made no analyses of,
and express no opinion as to, such loan portfolios, the Company’s review of such portfolios or Cascade’s allowances for loan losses
and, upon advice of the Company, we have assumed that the respective current allowances for loan losses and capital of the Company
and Cascade will be, in each case and in the aggregate, including on a pro forma basis, adequate to cover all such losses. In arriving at
our opinion, we have not conducted a physical inspection of the properties and facilities of the Company or Cascade and have not made
or obtained any evaluations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company or Cascade, including with respect to their loan
portfolios. Our opinion necessarily is based upon market, economic and other conditions as they exist on, and can be evaluated as of,
the date of this letter. We assume no responsibility for updating or revising our opinion based on events or circumstances that may
occur after the date of this letter. We express no

opinion as to the prices at which shares of common stock of Cascade or of the Company would trade following the announcement of
the Proposed Transaction or shares of the Company would trade following the consummation of the Proposed Transaction.

We have assumed that the executed Agreement will conform in all material respects to the last draft reviewed by us. In addition,
we have assumed the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement and all agreements related thereto. We
have also assumed, upon the advice of the Company, that all material governmental, regulatory and third party approvals, consents and
releases for the Proposed Transaction will be obtained within the constraints contemplated by the Agreement and that the Proposed
Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any
material term, condition or agreement thereof. We do not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result
from the Proposed Transaction, nor does our opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which we
understand that the Company has obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion as of the date hereof that, from a financial point of view, the
Consideration to be paid by the Company in the Proposed Transaction is fair to the Company.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Proposed Transaction and will receive fees for our
services a portion of which is payable upon rendering this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the
consummation of the Proposed Transaction. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for
certain liabilities that may arise out of our engagement. We have performed various investment banking services for the Company in
the past, and expect to perform such services in the future, and expect to receive, customary fees for such services.

In addition, we and our affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, or in the future may provide, investment
banking services to certain significant shareholders of Cascade (the “Sponsors”), and certain of their affiliates and portfolio companies
and have received or in the future may receive customary fees for rendering such services, including (i) having acted or acting as
financial advisor to Sponsors and certain of their portfolio companies and affiliates in connection with certain mergers and acquisition
transactions; (ii) having acted or acting as arranger, bookrunnner and/or lender for Sponsors and certain of their portfolio companies
and affiliates in connection with the financing for various acquisition transactions; and (iii) having acted or acting as underwriter, initial
purchaser and placement agent for various equity and debt offerings undertaking by Sponsors and certain of their portfolio companies
and affiliates.

Barclays Capital Inc., its subsidiaries and its affiliates engage in a wide range of businesses from investment and commercial
banking, lending, asset management and other financial and non-financial services. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our
affiliates may actively trade and effect transactions in the equity, debt and/or other securities (and any derivatives thereof) and financial
instruments (including loans and other obligations) of the Company and Cascade for our own account and for the accounts of our
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold long or short positions and investments in such securities and financial instruments.

Bend, OR 97703

Members of the Board:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, no par value (the
“Company Common Stock”), of Cascade Bancorp (the “Company”), of the Merger Consideration (as defined below) to be received
pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 15, 2016 (the “Agreement”), to be entered into between the
Company and First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (the “Parent”). The Agreement provides for, among other things, the merger of the
Company with and into the Parent (the “Merger”). The Parent will be the survivor of the Merger, and is called the “Surviving
Corporation” upon and following the Merger’s effective time (the “Effective Time”).

Upon the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except for certain shares of Company Common Stock specified in the Agreement, shall be converted based on the exchange ratio (the
“Exchange Ratio”) into the right to receive 0.14864 shares (the “Stock Consideration”) of Class A common stock, no par value per
share, of the Parent (the “Parent Common Stock”) plus $1.91 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”, and together with the Stock
Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this letter have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.

Piper Jaffray and Co. (“Piper Jaffray”), as part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial
institutions and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions. In arriving at our opinion,
we have: (i) reviewed and analyzed the financial terms of a draft of the Agreement dated November 15, 2016; (ii) reviewed and
analyzed certain financial and other data with respect to the Company and the Parent, which was publicly available or made available
to us by the Company or by the Parent that we deemed relevant; (iii) reviewed and analyzed certain forward-looking information
relating to the Company and the Parent that was publicly available, as well as that which was furnished to us by the Company and the
Parent, including the Company’s internal forecasts of expected operating results on a stand-alone basis; (iv) reviewed and analyzed
materials detailing the Merger prepared by the Company, the Parent and their respective affiliates and by their respective legal and
accounting advisors including the estimated amount and timing of the assumptions relating to transaction expenses, regulatory costs,
synergies and purchase accounting adjustments expected to result from the Merger (the “Synergies”); (v) engaged in discussions with
members of management and representatives of the Company and the Parent concerning the matters described in clauses (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv) above, as well as their respective businesses and prospects before and after giving effect to the Merger and the Synergies;
(vi) reviewed the current and historical reported prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock
relative to the Merger Consideration and similar information for certain other publicly traded companies deemed by us to be
comparable to the Company and Parent; (vii) compared the financial performance of the Company and the Parent with that of certain
other publicly traded companies that we deemed relevant; (viii) performed certain financial analyses for the Company and the Parent
on a pro forma combined basis giving effect to the Merger based on assumptions relating to the Synergies, as provided by the
management of the Parent and approved by the Company; (ix) performed a discounted cash flow analysis for each of the Company and
the Parent on a

stand-alone basis; (x) considered the current market environment generally and the community banking environment in particular; and
(xi) reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain business combination transactions in the depository
banking industry that we deemed relevant. In addition, we have conducted such other analyses, examinations and inquiries and
considered such other financial, economic and market criteria as we have deemed necessary in arriving at our opinion.

In arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed, without assuming liability or responsibility for independent verification,
the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished, or otherwise made available, to us or
discussed with or reviewed by us. We have further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company and the Parent that
the financial information provided has been prepared on a reasonable basis in accordance with industry practice, and that they are not
aware of any information or facts that would make any information provided to us incomplete or misleading. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, for the purpose of this opinion, we have assumed that with respect to financial forecasts, estimates and
other forward-looking information (including the Synergies) reviewed by us, that such information has been reasonably prepared based
on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company and the Parent as to
the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company and the Parent, respectively, to which such financial
forecasts, estimates and other forward-looking information (including the Synergies) relate and we have assumed that such results
would be achieved. We express no opinion as to any such financial forecasts, estimates or forward-looking information (including the
Synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based.

We express no opinion as to any of the legal, accounting and tax matters relating to the Merger and any other transactions contemplated
in connection therewith and have relied, with your consent, on advice of the outside legal counsel and the independent accountants to
the Company, and on the assumptions of the management of the Company and the Parent, as to all accounting, legal, tax and financial
reporting matters with respect to the Company, the Parent and the Agreement.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed that the executed Agreement will be, in all material respects, identical to the last draft
reviewed by us. We have relied upon and assumed, with your consent, without independent verification, that (i) the representations and
warranties of all parties to the Agreement and all other related documents and instruments that are referred to therein are true and
correct, (ii) each party to such agreements will fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed
by such party, (iii) the Merger will be consummated pursuant to the terms of the Agreement without any amendment thereto and (iv) all
conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver by any party of any condition or obligation thereunder.
Additionally, we have assumed that all the necessary regulatory approvals and consents required for the Merger will be obtained timely
and without conditions or commitments that would adversely affect the Company, the Parent or the contemplated benefits of the
Merger.

We have not performed any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or liabilities (fixed, contingent, derivative, off-balance sheet,
or other) of the Company or the Parent, and have not been furnished or provided with any such appraisals or valuations, nor have we
evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Parent under any state or federal law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. We have also assumed in all respects material to our analysis that the Company and the Parent would remain as a going
concern for all periods relevant to our analysis. Accordingly, we express no opinion regarding such valuations, or the solvency or the
liquidation value of the Company, the Parent or any other entity. We have assumed that there has been no material change in the
respective assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of the Company or the Parent since the date of the
most recent financial data made available to us. Without limiting the

generality of the foregoing, we have not: (i) conducted a review of any individual credit files of the Company or the Parent, nor have
we evaluated the adequacy of the loan or lease reserves of the Company or the Parent, (ii) conducted a review of any credit or loan
marks or other mark-to-market adjustment which may be taken in connection with the Merger, nor have we evaluated the adequacy of
any contemplated credit or loan marks to be so taken, or (iii) conducted a review of the collectability of any asset or the future
performance of any loan or other assets of the Company or the Parent. We have assumed, with your consent that the respective
allowances for loan and lease losses for the Company and the Parent, and the credit or loan marks are adequate to cover such losses and
will be adequate, without change, on a pro forma basis for the Parent. Accordingly, we express no opinion with respect to the
foregoing.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we have undertaken no independent analysis of any pending or threatened litigation,
regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which the Company or the Parent is a party or may be
subject, and at the direction of the Company and with your consent, our opinion makes no assumption concerning, and therefore does
not consider, the possible assertion of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any such matters. We understand and assume, based
on our discussions, that none of the Company, the Parent, nor any of their respective subsidiaries is party to any material pending
transaction, including without limitation any financing, recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the
Merger and the merger of the principal banking subsidiaries of the Company and Parent contemplated by the Agreement.

No company or transaction used in any analysis for purposes of comparison is identical to the Company, or the Parent, or the Merger.
Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the comparisons is not solely mathematical; rather, it involves complex considerations and
judgments about differences in the companies and transactions to which the Company, Parent and the Merger were compared and other
factors that could affect the public trading value or transaction value of the Company, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

This opinion is necessarily based on current economic, market and other conditions and upon the information available to us and facts
and circumstances as they exist and are subject to evaluation on the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof could materially
affect the assumptions used in preparing this opinion. We are not expressing any opinion herein as to the price at which shares of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock may trade following announcement of the Merger or at any future time. We have
no obligation to reaffirm or revise this opinion or otherwise comment upon any event occurring after the date hereof and do not have
any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

We have been engaged by the Company to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger and we will receive a transaction
fee from the Company for providing our services, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.
We will also receive a fee for rendering this opinion. Our opinion fee is not contingent upon the consummation of the Merger or the
conclusions reached in our opinion. The Company has also agreed to indemnify us against certain liabilities and reimburse us for
certain expenses in connection with our services. We or the lead banker on our current deal team acted as financial advisor to the
Company in connection with (i) its April 2016 acquisition of Prime Pacific Financial Services, (ii) its May 2014 acquisition of Home
Federal Bancorp, and its (iii) March 2016 acquisition of certain branches from Bank of America Corporation. In addition, in the
ordinary course of our business, we and our affiliates may actively trade securities of the Company or the Parent for our own account
or the account of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. We may also, in the
future, provide investment banking and financial advisory services to the Company or Parent or entities that are affiliated with the
Company or Parent, for which we would expect to receive compensation.

Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, Piper Jaffray has adopted policies and procedures to establish and
maintain the independence of its Research Department and personnel. As a result, Piper Jaffray’s research analysts may hold opinions,
make statements or recommendations, and/or publish research reports with respect to the Company, the Parent and the Merger and
other participants in the Merger that differ from the views of Piper Jaffray’s investment banking personnel.

This opinion is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Merger and is not
intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as to how such shareholder should act or
vote with respect to the Merger or any other matter. The use of this opinion and any description of our work and this opinion in, or in
connection with the proxy statement relating to the Merger are subject to our prior review and written consent in accordance with our
engagement letter with the Company. Otherwise, this opinion shall not be disclosed, referred to, published or otherwise used (in whole
or in part), nor shall any public references to us be made, without our prior written approval. This opinion has been approved for
issuance by the Piper Jaffray Opinion Committee.

This opinion addresses solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Company Common Stock of the proposed
Merger Consideration set forth in the Agreement and does not address any other term or agreement relating to the Merger or the
Agreement. We were not requested to opine as to, and this opinion does not address, the Company’s business decision to proceed with
or effect the Merger, the merits of the Merger relative to any alternative transaction or business strategy that may be available to the
Company, the Parent’s ability to fund the Cash Consideration, or any other term contemplated by the Agreement or the fairness of the
Merger to holders of any other class of Company securities, or to the Company’s creditors or other constituencies. Furthermore, we
express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of compensation to any officer, director or employee of any party to the
Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Company Common Stock in the
Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation, including whether such payments are reasonable in the context of the
Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and based upon such other factors as we consider relevant, it is our opinion that the Merger
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the date hereof.

otherwise required by applicable law. The notice shall specify the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a

resolution duly adopted by a majority of the Board members then in office upon public notice given prior to the date previously

receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.

dividends or interest on securities during a twelve (12) month period, have been mailed addressed to such person at such person’s
address as shown on the records of the corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice to such person shall

The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the Board, keep a record of its
shareholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each shareholder, a copy of these bylaws, as
may be amended to date, minute books, accounting books and other records.

Any such records maintained by the corporation may be kept on, or by means of, or be in the form of, any information storage device
or method, provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable time. When records
are kept in such manner, a clearly legible paper form produced from or by means of the information storage device or method shall be
admissible in evidence, and accepted for all other purposes, to the same extent as an original paper form accurately portrays the record.

Any shareholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof,
have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation’s stock ledger, a list of its
shareholders, and its other books and records, as permitted under Montana law, and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper
purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person’s interest as a shareholder. In every instance where an attorney or other
agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other
writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the shareholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the
corporation at its registered office in Montana or at its principal executive office.

Table of Contents

not affect shares already represented by certificates until they are surrendered to the corporation. The rights and obligations of
shareholders within the same class or series are identical whether or not their shares are represented by certificates.

If the Board does not authorize the issue of uncertificated shares, then the shares of any or all of its classes or series shall be
represented by certificates. If shares of the corporation are represented by certificates, each share certificate shall state on its face the
name of the person to whom issued, the number and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, that the certificate
represents, and all other requirements applicable thereto as set forth in the Montana Business Corporation Act. Each share certificate
must be signed, either manually or in facsimile, by two officers designated in these bylaws and may bear the corporate seal or its
facsimile. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has
signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before
such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or
registrar at the date of issue.

If the Board authorizes the issue of uncertificated shares, then within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of shares without
certificates, the corporation shall send to each shareholder, at the shareholder’s address of record on the books and records of the
corporation, a written statement of the information that would be required on certificates representing shares as set forth in the Montana
Act.

NASDAQ or the NYSE, the corporation shall ensure that all securities listed for trading are eligible for a Direct Registration Program
(as defined below) operated by a clearing agency registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. For purposes of these bylaws, a
“Direct Registration Program” shall mean any program by the corporation, directly or through the corporation’s transfer agent or
registrar, whereby a shareholder may have securities registered in the shareholder’s name on the books of the corporation or its transfer
agent or registrar without the need for a physical certificate to evidence ownership.

7.4 SPECIAL DESIGNATION FOR MORE THAN ONE CLASS OR SERIES

If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class and the corporation issues
certificated shares, then the powers, designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class
of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or
summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided,
however, that, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation
shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each shareholder
who so requests the powers, designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock
or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. If the corporation issued
uncertificated shares, then the powers, designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each
class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in the
Articles.

7.5 LOST CERTIFICATES

Except as provided in this Section 7.5, no new certificates for certificated shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued
certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate
of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner’s legal representative, to give the
corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

Corporation Act, as now or hereafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in
the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person (or the legal representative of such person) is or was a director or
officer of the corporation or any predecessor of the corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the corporation serving at the
request of the corporation as a director or officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action,
suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,
create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe
that such person’s conduct was unlawful.

8.2 POWER TO INDEMNIFY IN ACTIONS, SUITS OR PROCEEDINGS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE

corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the corporation serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including
attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if
such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have
been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.

Table of Contents

8.3 AUTHORIZATION OF INDEMNIFICATION

Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has
met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such
determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority
vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of
such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or
if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the shareholders (but only if a majority of the
directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue
of entitlement to indemnification to the shareholders for their determination). Such determination shall be made, with respect to former
directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the corporation. To the extent,
however, that a present or former director or officer of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against
expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of
authorization in the specific case.

8.4 GOOD FAITH DEFINED

For purposes of any determination under Section 8.3 of this Article VIII, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a person
shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such
person’s conduct was unlawful, if such person’s action is based on the records or books of account of the corporation or another
enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the corporation or another enterprise in the course of their
duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to
the corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with
reasonable care by the corporation or another enterprise. The term “another enterprise” as used in this Section 8.4 shall mean any other
corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 8.4 shall not be deemed to be
exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.

8.5 INDEMNIFICATION BY A COURT

Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 8.3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence
of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the court for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible
under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that
indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of
conduct set forth in Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case
under Section 8.3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a
presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any
application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall be given to the corporation promptly upon the filing of such
application. If successful on the merits, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the reasonable
expense of prosecuting such application.

8.6 EXPENSES PAYABLE IN ADVANCE

To the fullest extent prohibited by the Montana Business Corporation Act, or by any other applicable law, expenses reasonably incurred
by a person who is or was a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or
proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding; provided, however, an
advance of expenses incurred by any person in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity) shall be made
only upon receipt of a signed statement by or on behalf of such person that such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set
forth in Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be, and an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this
Article VIII.

8.7 NONEXCLUSIVITY OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Articles, any bylaw,
agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the corporation that indemnification of the persons specified
in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall
not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article VIII but whom
the corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the Montana Business Corporation Act, or otherwise.
The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents
respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Montana Business Corporation Act, or by any other
applicable law.

8.8 INSURANCE

To the fullest extent permitted by the Montana Business Corporation Act or any other applicable law, the corporation may purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against
such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person’s status as such, whether or not the
corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article
VIII.

8.9 CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

For purposes of this Article VIII, references to “the corporation” shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent
corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had
continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or
officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or
surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
For purposes of this Article VIII, references to “fines” shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee
benefit plan; and references to “serving at the request of the corporation” shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit
plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person

reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted
in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the corporation” as referred to in this Article VIII.

8.10 SURVIVAL OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this Article VIII shall continue as to a person who has ceased
to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and other personal and legal
representatives of such a person.

8.11 LIMITATION ON INDEMNIFICATION

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification
(which shall be governed by Section 8.5 hereof), the corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or
consented to by the Board.

8.12 INDEMNIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS

The corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, provide rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the corporation similar to those conferred in this Article VIII to directors and
officers of the corporation.

8.13 EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL

Neither any amendment or repeal of any Section of this Article VIII, nor the adoption of any provision of the Articles or the bylaws
inconsistent with this Article VIII, shall adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer, employee or other agent
established pursuant to this Article VIII existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision,
including without limitation by eliminating or reducing the effect of this Article VIII, for or in respect of any act, omission or other
matter occurring, or any action or proceeding accruing or arising (or that, but for this Article VIII, would accrue or arise), prior to such
amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

ARTICLE IX – AMENDMENTS

The bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of the voting power of the shareholders entitled to
vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its Articles, also confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the
Board. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the Board shall not divest the shareholders of the power, nor limit their
power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
