June 1, 2017

Dear Stockholder:

        You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders of Forestar Group Inc., which we refer to as Forestar or the Company, to be held on July 7, 2017, at 9:00 a.m. (Central time), at
6300 Bee Cave Road, Building Two, Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78746.

        At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon (1) a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 13, 2017, as it may be amended from time to time, which
we refer to as the merger agreement, among Terra Firma Merger Parent, L.P., which we refer to as Merger Parent, Terra Firma Merger Sub, L.P., which we refer to as Merger Sub and which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Merger Parent, and Forestar, pursuant to which Forestar will merge with and into Merger Sub (which we refer to as the merger) and Merger Sub will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Merger Parent, (2) a non-binding advisory proposal to approve specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger and (3) a
proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. Merger Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Starwood Capital Group.

        If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $14.25 in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Forestar common stock you own (unless you have properly
exercised your appraisal rights with respect to such shares). The merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 8.2% over the volume weighted average trading price of Forestar's common stock
for the 90-day period ending on April 13, 2017 of $13.17.

        Forestar's Board of Directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
Forestar and its stockholders, and approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Forestar's Board of Directors unanimously
recommends that you vote (i) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (ii) "FOR" the proposal to approve, by non-binding advisory vote, specified compensation that may be paid or
become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger and (iii) "FOR" the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the special meeting, the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement.
The proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of our Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger. We encourage you to read the proxy
statement and its annexes, including the merger agreement, carefully and in their entirety. You may also obtain more information about Forestar from documents we file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission from time to time.

        Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person, please complete, sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or
grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. If you attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy that you have previously submitted. If you

hold your shares in "street name," you should instruct your broker how to vote in accordance with the voting instruction form you will receive from your broker, bank or other nominee.

        Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. We cannot complete the merger unless the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Forestar common stock. The failure of any stockholder to vote in person by ballot at the special meeting, to submit a signed proxy card
or to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If you hold your shares in "street
name," the failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares of Forestar common stock, please contact D. F. King & Co., Inc., our proxy solicitor, by calling 800-290-6431 toll-free.

        Thank you for your support of Forestar.

        Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved of the transactions described in this document, including the
merger, or determined if the information contained in this document is accurate or adequate. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

        The accompanying proxy statement is dated June 1, 2017 and, together with the enclosed form of proxy card, is first being mailed to Forestar stockholders on or about June 2, 2017.

  Sincerely,

  

  
James A. Rubright
Chairman of the Board

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

        A special meeting of stockholders of Forestar Group Inc., which we refer to as "Forestar" or the "Company," will be held on July 7, 2017, at 9:00 a.m. (Central time), at 6300 Bee Cave Road, Building Two,
Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78746, to consider and vote upon the following proposals:

1. to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 13, 2017, as it may be amended from time to time, among Terra Firma Merger Parent, L.P., which we refer to as Merger Parent,
Terra Firma Merger Sub, L.P., which we refer to as Merger Sub, and Forestar; 

2. to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger contemplated
by the merger agreement; and 

3. to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        Your vote is very important.    We cannot consummate the merger unless the proposal to adopt the merger agreement receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common
stock entitled to vote thereon.

        Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, we request that you complete, sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or
grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone prior to the special meeting to ensure that your shares of Forestar common stock will be represented and voted at the special meeting if you are
unable to attend. Failure to complete, sign, date and return a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone or to vote in person by ballot at the Company special meeting will
result in your shares of Forestar common stock not being counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. For more information concerning the special meeting, the merger agreement and the merger, please review the accompanying proxy statement and the copy of the
merger agreement attached as Annex A thereto.

        Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 19, 2017 are entitled to notice of the special meeting and to vote at the special meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. A list

at least 10 days before the special meeting and at the place of the special meeting during the meeting.

        Forestar's Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (i) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (ii) "FOR" the proposal to approve, by non-binding advisory
vote, specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger and (iii) "FOR" the proposal to approve the
adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement.

The Merger (page 27)

        At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 13, 2017, as it may be amended from time to time, which
we refer to as the "merger agreement," among Forestar, Merger Parent and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Forestar will merge with and into Merger Sub, which we refer to as the
"merger," and Merger Sub will continue as the surviving entity following the merger and will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Parent. If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to
receive $14.25 in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Forestar common stock you own (unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights with respect to
such shares), which represents a premium of approximately 8.2% over the volume weighted average trading price of Forestar's common stock for the 90-day period ending on April 13, 2017 of $13.17.

The Special Meeting (page 21)

        The special meeting will be held on July 7, 2017, at 9:00 a.m. (Central time), at 6300 Bee Cave Road, Building Two, Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78746.

Record Date and Quorum (page 22)

        Only Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 19, 2017 are entitled to notice of the special meeting and to vote at the special meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

        The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of Forestar common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date will constitute a
quorum, permitting the Company to conduct its business at the special meeting.

Required Vote (page 22)

        Each share of Forestar common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote at the special meeting.

        For the Company to complete the merger, Company stockholders holding a majority of the shares of Forestar common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date must vote "FOR"
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of Forestar common stock or an abstention from voting for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will have the same effect
as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        The approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the proposal regarding specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with
the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting at which a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is present, a failure to vote your shares of Forestar common
stock, an abstention from voting or a "broker non-vote" will have no effect on this proposal.

        The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, is required to approve the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting,
if necessary or appropriate. A failure to vote your shares of Forestar common stock, an abstention from voting or a "broker non-vote" will have no effect on this proposal.

        As of the record date, there were 41,934,751 shares of Forestar common stock outstanding.

        We currently expect that the Company's directors and executive officers will vote their shares, representing approximately 3.2% of the outstanding shares of Forestar common stock, in favor of the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.

Table of Contents

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (page 79)

        The following are some of the conditions that must be satisfied or, where permitted by law, waived before each party is required to consummate the merger:

• no applicable law, temporary restraining order, injunction or other judgment, order or decree of a governmental entity shall be in effect which has the effect of prohibiting the
consummation of the merger or making consummation of the merger illegal; 

• the adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Forestar common stock, which we refer to as the "Company
stockholder approval"; 

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Forestar, on the one hand, and Merger Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, in the merger agreement, subject in some instances
to materiality, material adverse effect or other qualifiers, as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing date of the merger; 

• the performance or compliance in all material respects by Forestar, on the one hand, and Merger Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, of their respective obligations required to be
performed or complied with by them under the merger agreement at or prior to the closing date of the merger; 

• the number of dissenting shares representing less than 20% of the shares of Forestar common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing; 

• certain specified asset divestiture transactions shall have been consummated by the Company or minimum proceeds related thereto shall have been received by the Company (which
condition has been satisfied as of the date of this proxy statement); and 

• the absence of a "Company material adverse effect" since the date of the merger agreement.

        While it currently is anticipated that the merger will be completed in the third quarter of 2017, there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, or that an
effect, event, development or change will not transpire that could delay or prevent these conditions from being satisfied.

When the Merger Becomes Effective (page 67)

        The respective obligations of the parties to complete the merger are subject to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Company's stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing
conditions. The merger agreement provides that the closing of the merger is to occur on the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the closing conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, unless another date is agreed to in writing by Forestar and Merger Parent.

Recommendation of the Forestar Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger (page 42)

        The Forestar board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. For a description of the reasons considered
by the Forestar board of directors in deciding to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement, see "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Recommendation of the Forestar Board of Directors and Reasons for
the Merger."

Opinion of Forestar's Financial Advisor (page 46)

        In connection with the merger, Forestar's board of directors received a written opinion, dated April 13, 2017, from JMP Securities LLC, which we refer to as "JMP," as to the fairness, from a

financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to holders of Forestar common stock (other than Merger Parent and its affiliates) of the $14.25 per share merger consideration to be received by
such holders in the merger.

        The full text of JMP's written opinion, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B, sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on
the review undertaken. JMP's opinion was provided to Forestar's board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the merger. JMP's opinion did not address
the underlying decision of Forestar to proceed with or effect the merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative strategy or transaction that might exist for
Forestar. JMP's opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how Forestar's board of directors or any shareholder should act or vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.
Forestar's stockholders are urged to read carefully JMP's opinion in its entirety.

        For a more complete description, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Opinion of Forestar's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 46.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards (page 67)

        The merger agreement provides that each equity incentive compensation award denominated in shares of Forestar common stock (an "Equity Award") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be cancelled as of the effective time. In exchange for such cancellation, the holders of Equity Awards will receive the merger consideration for each share of common
stock underlying the Equity Award (plus payment in cash of all accrued dividend equivalents, if any, with respect thereto and, in the case of equity awards that are stock options or stock appreciation
rights, less the aggregate exercise or strike price thereunder, but not less than $0), whether or not such Equity Award was vested as of the effective time of the merger, with such payment subject to
applicable tax withholding.

        With respect to Equity Awards that vest upon the achievement of performance-based metrics, the number of shares of Forestar common stock subject to such Equity Awards will be determined
according to the terms set forth in the applicable award agreements.

Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 56)

        You should be aware that the Company's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of the Company's stockholders generally.
These interests are described in more detail in the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 56. The
Company's board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the merger and in making its recommendations that the Company stockholders adopt
the merger agreement. These interests include the following, among others:

• the accelerated vesting, cancellation and cash-out of Equity Awards; 

• continued employment of some or all of the executive officers; 

• the entitlement of the current executive officers to receive severance benefits under their respective change in control/severance agreements upon a qualifying termination of employment
following completion of the merger (and, in the case of Mr. Grimm, to receive the benefits that would have been provided under such agreement in those circumstances had his
employment with the Company not already terminated); and 

• continued indemnification and directors' and officers' liability insurance to be provided by the surviving entity.

Financing (page 62)

        Merger Parent and Merger Sub have represented to the Company that Merger Parent will have sufficient funds at the closing of the merger, taken together with our cash on hand, to pay all cash
amounts required to be paid by Merger Parent and Merger Sub under the merger agreement.

        Merger Parent anticipates that the funds needed to close the merger will be funded through a combination of equity financing from SOF-X U.S. Holdings, L.P., an affiliate of Starwood, which we
refer to SOF-X U.S. Holdings, in an amount up to $476.48 million and our cash on hand.

        The consummation of the merger is not subject to any financing conditions, although funding of the equity financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the commitment letter
under which the equity financing will be provided.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 63)

        The receipt of cash for shares of Forestar common stock pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as
defined under "The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger") in exchange for such U.S. Holder's shares of Forestar common stock in the merger will generally result in the
recognition of gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash such U.S. Holder receives in the merger and such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of
Forestar common stock surrendered in the merger. A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under "The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger") will generally not be subject to U.S.
federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Forestar common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder exceeds certain ownership levels or has certain connections to the United
States. Holders should refer to the discussion in the section entitled "The Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger," and consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

Regulatory Matters (page 65)

        We are not aware of any material U.S. federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are required for the execution of the merger agreement or the completion of the merger, other
than the filing of a Certificate of Merger with respect to the merger with, and the acceptance of such Certificate of Merger for record by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

Appraisal Rights (page 90)

        Under Delaware law, you are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger, in lieu of the merger consideration.

        If you comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), you will have the right under Delaware law to receive, in lieu of the
merger consideration, the fair value of your shares of Forestar common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments
made by the surviving company pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL). The amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair value of Forestar common stock as of
the effective time of the merger could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. Your appraisal
rights are subject to a number of restrictions and technical requirements (including relating to the

aggregate amount of shares of common stock owned by stockholders seeking appraisal). Generally, in order to perfect your appraisal rights, you must, among other things, comply with the following
procedures:

• prior to the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting, you must deliver to Forestar a written demand for appraisal of your shares that complies with the applicable statutory
requirements; 

• you must not vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, either by proxy or in person, at the special
meeting; 

• you must continue to hold your shares through the effective time of the merger; 

• if the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved at the special meeting, you must not submit your shares for payment of the merger consideration; and 

• within 120 days of the effective time of the merger, you must file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, requesting a determination of the fair value of your shares of
Forestar common stock as of the effective time of the merger.

        Merely voting against the merger proposal will not perfect your appraisal rights. If you hold your shares in "street name," you must instruct your broker or other nominee to take action in strict
compliance with the DGCL to exercise your appraisal rights. Requirements under Delaware law for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail under "Appraisal Rights". The discussion of
appraisal rights contained in this proxy statement is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights available to stockholders of Delaware corporations in certain mergers and consolidations that is reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you wish to avail
yourself of your appraisal rights, you should consult your legal advisor due to the complexity of the appraisal process. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result
in the loss of your appraisal rights.

Delisting and Deregistration of Forestar Common Stock (page 65)

        If the merger is completed, Forestar common stock will be delisted from the NYSE, and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the "Exchange
Act."

Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals (page 72)

        Except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, Forestar has agreed that it shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, auditors,
attorneys, financial advisors and other agents (referred to as "representatives") to (i) immediately cease and terminate all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to an
acquisition proposal, as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals," (ii) cease providing information with
respect to Forestar, its subsidiaries or any acquisition proposal, (iii) terminate access to physical or electronic data rooms for such persons, (iv) request that persons in possession of confidential
information about Forestar, furnished by Forestar in connection with previous discussions, to destroy such information, and (v) not, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, request, initiate, or knowingly facilitate or encourage any proposal, offer or inquiry that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

• participate in discussions with, furnish any information to, or afford access to the business of the Company to, any third persons in connection with an acquisition proposal; 

• grant any waiver or release under or fail to enforce any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of Forestar or any of its subsidiaries, unless the Forestar
board of directors decides that the failure to grant such waiver or release would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; 

• approve any third person becoming an "interested stockholder" under Section 203 of the DGCL; 

• enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent or other agreement relating to an acquisition proposal; or 

• propose publicly to do any of the foregoing,

as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals."

        Under the merger agreement, generally, the Forestar board of directors may not: (i) withdraw, modify, or propose publicly or resolve to withhold or modify, in any manner adverse to Merger Parent
or Merger Sub, the board of directors' recommendation that the Forestar stockholders vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement (a "change in Company recommendation"), (ii) adopt,
approve, authorize, recommend or declare advisable any acquisition proposal, (iii) take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any public statement in connection with a tender or
exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication by the board of directors to Forestar's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (iv) enter into an agreement relating to an acquisition proposal.

        However, prior to receipt of Company stockholder approval, Forestar's board of directors, in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations set forth in the merger agreement, may, (i) make a
change in Company recommendation in connection with an acquisition proposal that constitutes a "superior proposal" or in connection with an intervening event that was not known to or reasonably
foreseeable by Forestar's board of directors as of the date of the merger agreement, or (ii) cause the Company to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to an
acquisition proposal that constitutes a "superior proposal," in each case as more fully described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation;
Acquisition Proposals," and in each case, subject to specified notice obligations to Merger Parent and specified obligations to negotiate and consider in good faith any revisions proposed by Merger Parent
to the merger agreement, as more fully described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements—No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposal; Notice of Acquisition
Proposal."

Termination (page 80)

        The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the effective time of the merger:

• by mutual written agreement of Forestar and Merger Parent; 

• by either Forestar or Merger Parent: 

• if the effective time shall not have occurred by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on October 10, 2017 (the "outside date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate the merger
agreement on this basis shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any

• if any judgment shall have become final that permanently restrains, prior to the closing, the consummation of the merger; provided that the party terminating the merger agreement
shall have used its reasonable best efforts to resist such judgment, and shall have complied in all material respects with the covenant requiring reasonable best efforts in obtaining
requisite approvals by applicable governmental entities or other third parties; 

• if the Company stockholder approval shall not have been obtained at the Forestar stockholders' meeting; or 

• by Forestar: 

• if there shall have been a material breach by Merger Parent or Merger Sub of any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in the merger agreement, such that either
of the conditions relating to the truth and correctness of Merger Parent's representations and warranties and Merger Parent's performance of all of its obligations would not be
satisfied, which breach is incapable of being cured by the outside date or is not cured within 10 business days after Merger Parent receives written notice of such breach from
Forestar; 

• at any time prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, in order to enter into a definitive, written agreement for a superior proposal, and prior to or concurrently with such
termination, Forestar pays to Merger Parent the Company termination fee; 

• if certain conditions are satisfied or waived, Forestar has confirmed by written notice its intention to terminate the merger agreement if Merger Parent and Merger Sub fail to
consummate the closing when required, Merger Parent has failed to consummate the closing within two business days of the date the closing should have occurred, and Forestar
stood ready to consummate the closing on the date following such two business days, and Forestar shall have given Merger Parent a written notice on or prior to such date
confirming such fact; or 

• if the equity commitment letter from SOF-X U.S. Holdings to Merger Parent shall have been terminated or shall have been amended in a manner materially adverse to Forestar; or 

• by Merger Parent: 

• at any time prior to the closing, if there shall have been a material breach by Forestar of any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in the merger agreement, such
that either of the conditions relating to the truth and correctness of Forestar's representations and warranties and Forestar's performance of all of its obligations would not be
satisfied, which breach is incapable of being cured by the outside date or is not cured by Forestar within 10 business days after Forestar receives written notice of such breach from
Merger Parent or Merger Sub; or 

• at any time prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, if the board of directors shall effect a change in Company recommendation or fail to publicly reaffirm the board
of directors' recommendation within 10 business days after Merger Parent or Merger Sub so requests in writing.

Termination Fees; Expense Reimbursement (page 81)

        If the merger agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, Forestar will be required to pay Merger Parent a termination fee of $20 million, which we refer to as the "Company termination
fee."

        Forestar will be required to pay the Company termination fee if the merger agreement is terminated:

• by Forestar, in order to enter into a definitive, written agreement for a superior proposal; 

• by Merger Parent, if the board of directors effects a change in Company recommendation or fails to reaffirm the board of directors' recommendation within 10 business days after Merger
Parent or Merger Sub so requests; or 

• (i) (A) by either Merger Parent or Forestar, if the merger has not closed by the outside date, (B) by either Merger Parent or Forestar, if the Company stockholder approval has not been
obtained, or (C) by Merger Parent, if there has been a material breach by Forestar of any of its representations, warranties or covenants, (ii) there has been publicly disclosed or proposed an
acquisition proposal that remains outstanding as of the date of termination of the merger agreement, and (iii) if within 12 months after such termination, Forestar enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal (provided that references to "15%" in the definition of "acquisition proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%").

        If the merger agreement is terminated in other specified circumstances, Merger Parent will be required to pay Forestar a termination fee of $40 million, which we refer to as the "Parent termination
fee."

        Merger Parent will be required to pay the Parent termination fee if the merger agreement is terminated:

• by Forestar, if there has been a material breach by Merger Parent or Merger Sub of any of their representations, warranties or covenants, such that certain conditions would not be satisfied; 

• by Forestar, pursuant to the clause allowing Forestar to terminate the merger agreement for Merger Parent's failure to consummate the closing within two business days of the date on
which the closing should have occurred; or 

• by Forestar, if the equity commitment letter shall have been terminated or shall have been amended in a manner materially adverse to Forestar.

        If the merger agreement is terminated:

• by either party if the merger has not closed by the outside date as a result of the failure of the asset divestiture condition (which condition has been satisfied as of the date of this proxy
statement); 

• by either party if the Company stockholder approval is not been obtained; or 

• by Merger Parent if there has been a material breach by Forestar of any of its representations, warranties or covenants such that certain conditions are not satisfied,

then Forestar shall reimburse Merger Parent for its actual and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000 (provided, with respect to the circumstances described in the first
bullet above, such amount is not to exceed $3,000,000). In no event shall Forestar be required to reimburse Merger Parent's expenses on more than one occasion and in no event shall the sum of the
amount reimbursed and Company termination fee payable by Forestar exceed the amount of the Company termination fee.

Limited Guarantee and Remedies (page 62)

        In connection with the merger agreement, SOF-X U.S. Holdings has agreed to, subject to the terms and conditions of a limited guarantee, absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee to
Forestar the payment of certain amounts required under the merger agreement by Merger Parent

including with respect to: (i) the payment of the $40 million Parent termination fee in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement; and (ii) certain indemnification and reimbursement obligations
in accordance with the merger agreement, in each case, as, when and to the extent due under the merger agreement. The limited guarantee will terminate on the earlier of (a) the closing of the merger,
(b) the payment in full of the guaranteed obligations (as specified in the limited guarantee) and (c) 120 days following a termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms (except as to
payments for which a claim has been made prior to such termination).

        We cannot seek specific performance to require Merger Parent and Merger Sub to perform their respective obligations under the merger agreement, including to complete the merger,
and our exclusive remedy for the failure of Merger Parent and Merger Sub to complete the merger is to seek payment of the $40 million Parent termination fee and certain indemnification
and reimbursement obligations, as supported by the limited guarantee described above.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

        The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the special meeting, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. These
questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a Company stockholder. Please refer to the "Summary" preceding this section and the more detailed information contained
elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in this proxy statement, all of which you should read carefully.

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement? 

A: On April 13, 2017, Forestar entered into the merger agreement providing for the merger of Forestar with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Merger Parent. You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Forestar board of directors in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and to
approve the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting. 

Q: What is the proposed transaction? 

A: The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company by Merger Parent through the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub pursuant to the merger agreement, with Merger Sub
continuing as the surviving entity in the merger. Following the effective time of the merger, as a result of the merger, the Company will be part of Merger Sub and privately held as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Merger Parent, and you will no longer own shares of Forestar common stock, only the right to receive the merger consideration. Merger Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Starwood. 

Q: What will I receive in the merger? 

A: If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $14.25 in cash, without interest, and subject to any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Forestar common stock that you own as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. For example, if you own 100 shares of Forestar common stock, you will be entitled to receive $1,425.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of
Forestar common stock (less any amount that may be withheld with respect to any applicable withholding taxes). You will not be entitled to receive shares in the surviving entity or in Merger Parent or
Starwood. 

Q: What will happen to the Company's outstanding equity awards? 

A: For information regarding the treatment of the Company's outstanding equity awards, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Company Equity Awards" beginning on page 67. 

Q: What is included in these materials? 

A: These materials include: 

• this proxy statement for the special meeting, 

• a proxy card (enclosed with this proxy statement), 

• a copy of the merger agreement (attached as Annex A to this proxy statement), 

• the written opinion of JMP (attached as Annex B to this proxy statement), and

Table of Contents

Q: Where and when is the special meeting? 

A: The special meeting will take place at 9:00 a.m. (Central time), on July 7, 2017 at 6300 Bee Cave Road, Building Two, Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78746. 

Q: What proposals will be voted on at the special meeting? 

A: There are three proposals scheduled to be voted on at the special meeting: 

• the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

• the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger;
and 

• the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting
to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

Q: What is the Forestar board of directors' voting recommendation? 

A: The Forestar board of directors recommends that you vote your shares: 

• "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

• "FOR" the approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger;
and 

• "FOR" the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting.

For a discussion of the factors that the Forestar board of directors considered in determining to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement, please see the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)
—Recommendation of the Forestar Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger." In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Forestar board of directors with respect to the merger
agreement, you should be aware that some of our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Company stockholders generally. For a
discussion of these interests, please see the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting? 

A: All shares owned by you as of the record date, which is the close of business on May 19, 2017, may be voted by you. You may cast one vote per share of Forestar common stock that you held on the
record date. These shares include shares that are: 

• held directly in your name as the stockholder of record; and 

• held for you as the beneficial owner through a broker, bank or other nominee.

On the record date, there were 41,934,751 shares of Forestar common stock issued and outstanding.

Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 

A: Many of our stockholders hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some differences between shares held of
record and those owned beneficially.

Table of Contents

• Stockholder of Record.  If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of
record, and this proxy statement was sent directly to you by the Company. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to certain officers of Forestar or to
vote in person at the special meeting. 

• Beneficial Owner.  If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee, like many of our stockholders, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name,
and this proxy statement was forwarded to you by that organization. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, and you are
also invited to attend the special meeting, although only your broker, bank or other nominee will have the right to vote your shares at the special meeting, and only to the extent you have
previously instructed it to do so. 

Q: What must I do if I want to attend the special meeting in person? 

A: Attendance at the special meeting is limited to individuals who were stockholders as of the record date. Registration and seating will begin at 8:30 a.m. (Central time). Each stockholder will be asked to
present proof of identification, such as a driver's license or passport, prior to admission to the special meeting. Beneficial owners of shares held in "street name" will need to bring proof of share
ownership as of the record date, such as a bank or brokerage firm account statement or a letter from the intermediary holding your shares. Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will
not be permitted at the special meeting. 

Q: If I am a stockholder of record of the Company's shares, how do I vote? 

A: If you are a stockholder of record, there are four ways you can vote or have your shares voted by submitting a proxy: 

• by voting in person at the special meeting; 

• by submitting a proxy via the internet, at the internet address provided on the proxy card; 

• by submitting a proxy by telephone, by calling 800-690-6903; or 

• by submitting a proxy by mail, by completing, signing and dating the proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. 

Q: If I am a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, how do I vote? 

A: If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you will receive instructions from the holder of record as to how to vote your shares. You must follow the instructions of the holder of record
in order for your shares to be voted. Telephone and internet voting also will be offered to stockholders owning shares through certain banks and brokers. If your shares are not registered in your own
name and you plan to vote your shares in person at the special meeting, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee to obtain a "legal proxy" or broker's proxy card and bring it to the special
meeting in order to vote. Please note that if you hold your shares through broker, bank or other nominee, such nominee cannot vote your shares unless you have given your nominee specific instructions
as to how to vote. In order for your vote to be counted, please make sure that you submit your vote to your broker, bank or other nominee. 

Q: Will my shares of Forestar common stock held in "street name" or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record? 

A: No. Because any shares of Forestar common stock you may hold in "street name" will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder of record than any shares of Forestar common stock you hold of
record, any shares of Forestar common stock held in "street name" will not be combined for

voting purposes with shares of Forestar common stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares of Forestar common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee
of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card or submit a proxy separately by telephone or internet with respect to those shares of Forestar
common stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of Forestar common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the
entity. Shares of Forestar common stock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing such account.

Q: What is the quorum requirement for the special meeting? 

A: A quorum is necessary to hold a valid special meeting. A quorum exists if the holders of a majority of the Company's capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting are
present in person or represented by proxy. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.

If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is
present at the special meeting.

If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, these shares will not be counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the special meeting.

Q: What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions? 

A: Stockholder of Record. If you are a stockholder of record and you submit a signed proxy card or submit your proxy by telephone or the internet, but do not specify how you want to vote your shares on a
particular proposal, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in accordance with the recommendations of the Forestar board of directors on all matters presented in this proxy statement.

Beneficial Owner. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," under the rules of the NYSE, the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares may generally vote on routine
matters but cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters. The proposals to (i) adopt the merger agreement, (ii) approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, specified compensation that may be
paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger and (iii) approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to
solicit additional proxies, are considered non-routine matters under applicable rules. If the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote
your shares on a non-routine matter, the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares will inform the representative counting votes that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with
respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." Therefore, we urge you to give voting instructions to your broker. Shares represented by such "broker non-votes" will not be
counted in determining whether there is a quorum. A "broker non-vote" will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Q: What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? 

A: Adoption of the merger agreement would require Company stockholders holding a majority of the shares of Forestar common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date for the special
meeting to vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of Forestar common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote

"AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, a
"broker non-vote" will arise and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

The approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the proposal regarding specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the
merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting at which a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is present at the special meeting, failure to vote your shares of
Forestar common stock, an abstention from voting or a "broker non-vote" will have no effect on this proposal.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, is required to approve the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate. A failure to vote your shares of Forestar common stock, an abstention from voting or a "broker non-vote" will have no effect on this proposal.

Q: How do Forestar's directors and executive officers intend to vote? 

A: We currently expect that the Company's directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the
special meeting; although they have no obligation to do so. 

Q: What effects will the merger have on the Company? 

A: Forestar common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act, and is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "FOR." As a result of the merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded
company and will be merged into Merger Sub, which will continue as the surviving entity following the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Parent. Following the consummation of the
merger, Forestar common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act. 

Q: When is the merger expected to be completed? 

A: We and Starwood are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible. We cannot be certain when or if the conditions to the merger will be satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived).
The merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived), including the adoption of the merger agreement by Company stockholders. Pursuant to
the terms of the merger agreement, the merger may not be completed prior to July 1, 2017, and assuming timely satisfaction of the closing conditions, we currently expect to complete the merger in the
third quarter of 2017. 

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed? 

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by the Company's stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, the Company stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of
Forestar common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, the Company will remain a public company, and shares of Forestar common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act,
as well as listed and traded on the NYSE. Upon a termination of the merger agreement prior to consummation of the merger, under certain circumstances, we will be required to pay Merger Parent a
termination fee of $20 million, and under certain other circumstances, Merger Parent will be required to pay a termination fee to us of $40 million. In addition, under certain circumstances, we will be
required to reimburse Merger Parent for up to $3 million or $4 million, as applicable, of its transaction expenses. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination—Termination Fees."

Q: What will happen if stockholders do not approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the proposal on specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named
executive officers in connection with the merger? 

A: The inclusion of this proposal is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission rules; however, the approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger and the vote on this
proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on the Company or Merger Parent. If the merger agreement is adopted by the Company's stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-
related compensation may be paid to the Company's named executive officers even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal. 

Q: Can I revoke my proxy or change my vote? 

A: Yes. You may revoke or change your proxy for any reason by: 

• providing a written notice that is received before the meeting to Forestar's Secretary, Matthew S. Stark, at Forestar Group Inc., 6300 Bee Cave Road, Building Two, Suite 500, Austin,
Texas 78746; 

• delivering a valid, later-dated proxy either by telephone or online (your last delivery before the meeting begins will be counted); or 

• if you are a registered stockholder (or if you hold your shares in "street name" and have a proper legal proxy from your broker), attending the special meeting and voting in person.

Please note that simply attending the special meeting in person will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked. Shares held in "street name" may be voted in person by you at the special
meeting only if you obtain a signed "legal proxy" from the stockholder of record giving you the right to vote the shares.

Q: What happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals? 

A: The requisite number of shares to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is based on the total number of shares of Forestar common stock outstanding on the record date, not just the shares
that are voted. If you do not vote or abstain from voting on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement
and will have no effect on the non-binding advisory proposal to approve specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the
merger and the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting. 

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of Forestar common stock before completion of the merger? 

A: In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of Forestar common stock through completion of the merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of Forestar common stock
before completion of the merger, you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger.

The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the consummation of the merger. If you transfer your shares of Forestar common stock after the record date but
before the closing of the merger, you will have the right to vote at the special meeting although you will have transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger.

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now? 

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares

of Forestar common stock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger consideration. If your shares of Forestar common stock are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee, you
may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take in order to effect the surrender of your "street name" shares in exchange for the merger
consideration. Do not send in your certificates now.

Q: If I do not know where my stock certificates are, how will I get the merger consideration for my shares? 

A: If the merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the merger will include the procedures that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificates. This
will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the loss of your stock certificates. You may also be required to post a bond as indemnity against any potential loss. 

Q: Am I entitled to exercise dissenters' or appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my shares of Forestar common stock? 

A: Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under Delaware law, if the merger is completed, stockholders of Forestar who do
not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement and who meet the other requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will have the right to receive payment of the fair value of their shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the surviving entity pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of
the DGCL). Your appraisal rights are subject to a number of restrictions and technical requirements (including relating to the aggregate amount of shares of common stock owned by stockholders
seeking appraisal). Appraisal rights will only be available to Forestar stockholders that deliver to Forestar a written demand for appraisal of their shares prior to the special meeting, do not vote in favor
of the merger proposal, hold their shares continuously through the effective time of the merger, do not submit their shares for payment of the merger consideration, and otherwise comply with the
statutory procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be the fair
value of Forestar stock as of the effective time of the merger could be more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration a stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the
merger agreement. A summary of Section 262 of the DGCL can be found along with additional information about appraisal rights under the section entitled "Appraisal Rights". The discussion of
appraisal rights contained in this proxy statement is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL
that is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. Because of the complexity of the DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your appraisal rights, we encourage you to seek
the advice of your own legal counsel. 

Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of Forestar common stock for cash pursuant to the merger? 

A: If you are a U.S. Holder, you will be required to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of Forestar common stock for cash pursuant to the merger in an amount
equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash you receive pursuant to the merger and your adjusted tax basis in your shares of Forestar common stock surrendered pursuant to the merger. A
Non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of Forestar common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder exceeds certain
ownership levels or has certain connections to the United States. Because

particular circumstances may differ, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your particular circumstances and any
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided under "The
Merger—U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger."

Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card? 

A: If your shares of Forestar common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy or voting instruction form. Please complete and return all of
the proxy cards you receive (or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the internet, if available to you) to ensure that all of your shares of Forestar common stock are voted. 

Q: How many copies should I receive if I share an address with another stockholder? 

A: Some banks, brokers and other nominee record holders may participate in the practice of "householding" proxy statements, annual reports and notices of internet availability of proxy materials. This
means that a single set of our proxy materials may have been sent to multiple stockholders in your household. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of our proxy materials to you if you write or call
our Secretary, Matthew S. Stark, at Forestar Group Inc., 6300 Bee Cave Road, Building Two, Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78746, telephone: (512) 433-5200. 

Q: Who will count the vote? 

A: A representative of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes. 

Q: Who will solicit and bear the cost of soliciting votes for the special meeting? 

A: Forestar will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials. In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes
may be made in person, by telephone or by electronic and facsimile transmission by our directors, officers and employees, who will not receive any additional compensation for such solicitation
activities. Forestar has engaged D. F. King & Co., Inc., which we refer to as "D. F. King," to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Forestar special meeting. Forestar estimates that it will pay D. F.
King a fee of approximately $20,000, plus reimbursement of certain expenses. In addition, the Company may reimburse its transfer agent, brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial
owners of shares of Forestar common stock for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to such beneficial owners. 

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting? 

A: Forestar will announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish preliminary, or final results if available, in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission within four business days after the special meeting. 

Q: Where can I find more information about Forestar? 

A: You can find more information about us from various sources described in the section entitled "Where You Can Find Additional Information." 

Q: Who can help answer my other questions? 

A: If you have more questions about the merger, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card,

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This proxy statement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are
difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are predictions based on expectations and projections about future events, and are not statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements include statements
concerning business strategy, plans and prospects, among other things, including anticipated trends and developments in and management plans for our business and the markets in which we operate. In some
cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words, such as "estimate," "expect," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "intend," "believe," "forecast," "foresee," "likely," "may," "should," "goal,"
"target," "might," "will," "could," "predict," and "continue," the negative or plural of these words and other comparable terminology. All forward-looking statements included in this proxy statement are based
upon information available to us as of the filing date of this proxy statement, and we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason. You should not place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or
achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement
include the factors identified in Forestar's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 under the heading "Risk Factors," as updated from time to time by Forestar's Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q and other documents of Forestar on file or in this proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by Forestar, including the following factors:

• one or more closing conditions to the transaction may not be satisfied or waived, on a timely basis or at all, including that the required approval by the stockholders of Forestar may not be
obtained or that holders of 20% or more of our common stock as of immediately prior to closing properly exercise appraisal rights; 

• there may be a material adverse change to Forestar or the business of Forestar may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the transaction; 

• the transaction may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays; 

• legal proceedings may be initiated related to the transaction; 

• our exclusive remedy against the counterparties to the merger agreement with respect to any breach of the merger agreement is limited, in certain circumstances, to seeking payment by Merger
Parent of a termination fee in the amount of $40 million (which amount is guaranteed by Merger Parent's sponsor), which may not be adequate to cover our damages; and 

• changes in economic conditions, political conditions, changes in federal or state laws or regulation may occur.

        There can be no assurance that the merger will be completed, or if it is completed, that it will close within the anticipated time period or that the expected benefits of the merger will be realized.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the information contained or incorporated by reference herein, including, but not limited to, (i) the
information contained under this heading and (ii) the information contained under the headings "Risk Factors" and information in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our most
recent filing on Form 10-K and subsequent periodic and interim report filings (see "Where You Can Find Additional Information" beginning on page 96). No assurance can be given that these are all of the
factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking statements.

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        We are furnishing this proxy statement to the Company's stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Forestar board of directors for use at the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. This proxy statement provides the Company's stockholders with the information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof.

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting 

        This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Forestar board of directors for use at the special meeting to be held on July 7, 2017, at 9:00 a.m.
(Central time), at 6300 Bee Cave Road, Building Two, Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78746, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

        Attendance at the special meeting is limited to individuals who were stockholders as of the record date and their authorized representatives. Registration and seating will begin at 8:30 a.m. (Central time).
Each stockholder will be asked to present proof of identification, such as a driver's license or passport, prior to admission to the special meeting. Beneficial owners of shares held in "street name" who desire to
attend the special meeting, will need to bring proof of share ownership as of the record date, such as a bank or brokerage firm account statement or a letter from the intermediary holding your shares. Cameras,
recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the special meeting.

        If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the special meeting by requesting a ballot when you arrive. You must bring valid picture identification such as a driver's license or passport and
may be requested to provide proof of stock ownership as of the record date. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and wish to vote in person at the special meeting, you must obtain a
"legal proxy" from the organization that holds your shares. A "legal proxy" is a written document that will authorize you to vote your shares held in "street name" at the special meeting. Please contact the
organization that holds your shares for instructions regarding obtaining a "legal proxy."

Purposes of the Special Meeting 

        One purpose of the special meeting is for our stockholders to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Our stockholders must adopt the merger agreement in order for the merger
to occur. If our stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement, the merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, and the material provisions of the
merger agreement are summarized in the section of this proxy statement entitled "The Merger Agreement."

        In addition, the Company is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named
executive officers in connection with the merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of this proxy statement entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of the Company's Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger." The non-binding advisory vote on specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger is
separate and apart from the vote to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to approve the executive compensation and vote not to adopt the merger agreement and vice versa. Because
the vote on executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Starwood. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by the Company's stockholders and the
merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to the Company's named executive officers even if stockholders fail to approve the proposal.

Table of Contents

        Our stockholders are also being asked to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our stockholders on or about June 2, 2017.

Record Date and Quorum 

        The holders of record of Forestar common stock as of the close of business on May 19, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. On
the record date, 41,934,751 shares of Forestar common stock were outstanding.

        The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of the Company's capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the close of
business on the record date will constitute a quorum, permitting the Company to conduct its business at the special meeting. Once a share is represented at the special meeting, it will be counted for the purpose
of determining a quorum at the special meeting. However, if a new record date is set for an adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. Proxies received but marked as abstentions
will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting. "Broker non-votes," described below under the sub-heading
"—Voting; Proxies; Revocation—Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy," will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present for the purpose of determining a quorum at the
special meeting.

Required Vote 

        Each share of Forestar common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on each of the proposals to be considered at the special meeting.

        For the Company to complete the merger, Company stockholders holding a majority of the shares of Forestar common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote
thereon must vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of Forestar common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, this will be deemed a
"broker non-vote," which will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        The approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the proposal regarding specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the
merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting at which a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is present, a failure to vote your shares of Forestar common stock, an
abstention from voting or a "broker non-vote" will have no effect on this proposal.

        The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, is required to approve the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate. A failure to vote your shares of Forestar common stock, an abstention from voting or a "broker non-vote" will have no effect on this proposal.

        As of the record date, there were 41,934,751 shares of Forestar common stock outstanding.

Voting by the Company's Directors and Executive Officers 

        At the close of business on May 19, 2017, directors and executive officers of the Company were entitled to vote 1,320,959 shares of Forestar common stock, or approximately 3.2% of the shares of Forestar
common stock issued and outstanding on that date. We currently expect that the Company's directors and executive officers will vote their shares representing approximately 3.2% of the outstanding shares of
Forestar common stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and in favor of the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation 

Attendance

        All holders of shares of Forestar common stock as of the close of business on May 19, 2017, the record date, including stockholders of record and beneficial owners of Forestar common stock registered in
the "street name" of a broker, bank or other nominee, are invited to attend the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver's license or
passport. If you hold your shares in "street name," you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee or
other similar evidence of ownership, along with proper identification.

Voting in Person

        Stockholders of record will be able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record, but instead hold your shares of Forestar common stock in "street name" through a broker,
bank or other nominee, you must provide a "legal proxy" from the organization that holds your share in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting.

Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy

        To ensure that your shares of Forestar common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting
in person.

Shares of Forestar Common Stock Held by Record Holder

        If you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described below.

• Via the internet.  You can submit a proxy over the internet at www.proxyvote.com by following the instructions on the proxy card. 

• By Telephone.  You can submit a proxy by telephone by calling 800-690-6903 and following the instructions on the proxy card. 

• By Mail.  You can submit a proxy by mail by signing, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card.

        If you submit a signed proxy card or submit your proxy by telephone or the internet, but do not specify how you want to vote your shares on a particular proposal, then the proxy holders will vote your
shares in accordance with the recommendations of the Forestar board of directors on all matters presented in this proxy statement. With respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the special
meeting, the proxy holders will vote your shares in accordance with their best judgment. If you fail to return your proxy card and you are a holder of record on the record date, unless you attend the special
meeting and vote in person, the effect will be that your shares of Forestar common stock will not be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is

present at the special meeting, will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and, assuming a quorum is present, will not affect the proposal, on a non-binding advisory
basis, to approve specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger, or the vote regarding the adjournment of the special
meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies.

Shares of Forestar Common Stock Held in "Street Name"

        If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record, you will receive instructions from the holder of record as to how to vote your shares. You must follow the instructions of the
holder of record in order for your shares to be voted. Telephone and internet voting also will be offered to stockholders owning shares through certain banks and brokers. If your shares are not registered in your
own name and you plan to vote your shares in person at the special meeting, you should contact your broker or agent to obtain a "legal proxy" or broker's proxy card and bring it to the special meeting in order
to vote.

        In accordance with the rules of the NYSE, brokers, banks and other nominees who hold shares of Forestar common stock in "street name" for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the
shares with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, the non-binding advisory proposal to approve specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive
officers in connection with the merger, or the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies. Accordingly, if brokers, banks or other nominees do not
receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote such shares with respect to these proposals. Under such circumstances, a "broker non-vote" would arise. "Broker
non-votes," if any, will not be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement and, assuming a quorum is present, will have no effect on the proposal to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, specified compensation that may be paid or become
payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger or on the adjournment proposal. Thus, for shares of Forestar common stock held in "street name," only shares of Forestar
common stock affirmatively voted "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be counted as a vote in favor of such proposal.

Revocation of Proxies

        Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time before it is voted. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before
the vote is taken at the special meeting by:

• submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or internet proxy submission procedures described above, or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by
mail to Forestar; 

• attending the Company special meeting and voting in person; or 

• delivering a written notice of revocation by mail to Forestar's Secretary, Matthew S. Stark, at Forestar Group Inc., 6300 Bee Cave Road, Building Two, Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78746.

        Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the Company special meeting without taking one of the actions described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note
that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card or by sending a written notice of revocation to Forestar, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice of revocation
in sufficient time for it to be received by Forestar before the Company special meeting.

        If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your
proxy or submit new voting instructions.

Abstentions 

        An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting. Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of Forestar
common stock present or represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved. Abstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement and will have no effect on the non-binding advisory proposal to approve specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive
officers in connection with the merger or the adjournment proposal.

Adjournments and Postponements 

        Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed if necessary or appropriate, including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. In the event that a sufficient
number of shares of Forestar common stock is present or represented, in person or by proxy, and voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting such that the Company
stockholder approval shall have been obtained, the Company does not anticipate that it will adjourn or postpone the special meeting.

        The special meeting may be adjourned by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast in respect of shares of Forestar common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the
special meeting and entitled to vote at the special meeting or as otherwise permitted by law. Any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting will allow the Company's stockholders who have already
sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time before their use at the special meeting that was adjourned or postponed.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        The Forestar board of directors is soliciting your proxy, and the Company will bear the cost of this solicitation of proxies. This includes the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and
distributing these proxy materials. In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made in person, by telephone or by electronic and facsimile transmission by our
directors, officers and employees, who will not receive any additional compensation for such solicitation activities. Forestar has engaged D. F. King & Co., Inc., which we refer to as "D. F. King," to assist in the
solicitation of proxies for the Company special meeting. Forestar estimates that it will pay D. F. King a fee of approximately $20,000, plus reimbursement of certain expenses. In addition, the Company may
reimburse its transfer agent, brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares of Forestar common stock for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to such beneficial owners.

Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger 

        Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by our stockholders of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, we anticipate that the merger will be consummated
in the third quarter of 2017.

Householding of Special Meeting Materials 

        We may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside in accordance with SEC rules, unless we have received contrary instructions. Each

stockholder in the household will continue to receive a separate proxy card. This process, known as "householding," reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps to reduce
our expenses.

        If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your broker or direct your written request to Forestar's Secretary,
Matthew S. Stark, at Forestar Group Inc., 6300 Bee Cave Road, Building Two, Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78746, or by telephone at (512) 433-5200. We will promptly deliver upon written or oral request a
separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the proxy statement was delivered. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement
at their addresses and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their broker.

Other Information 

        You should not return your stock certificate or send documents representing Forestar common stock with the proxy card. If the merger is completed, the paying agent for the merger will send
to you a letter of transmittal and related materials and instructions for exchanging your shares of Forestar common stock for the merger consideration.

THE MERGER (PROPOSAL 1) 

        The description of the merger in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger that is important to you. You
are encouraged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Proposal 1: Adoption of the Merger Agreement 

        We are asking you to adopt the merger agreement. For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the merger agreement throughout this proxy statement,

        Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of the Company stockholders holding a majority of the shares of Forestar common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date and
entitled to vote thereon. A failure to vote your shares of Forestar common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        The Forestar board of directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Certain Effects of the Merger 

        If the merger agreement is adopted by the Company's stockholders and certain other conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied or waived, the Company will be merged with and into Merger
Sub with Merger Sub being the surviving entity in the merger.

        Upon the consummation of the merger, each share of Forestar common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger (other than shares owned or held in treasury by

consideration, and other than shares with respect to which the stockholder has properly exercised its appraisal rights) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $14.25 in cash, without interest, and
subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

        Forestar common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "FOR." As a result of the merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded
company and Merger Sub, which will be the surviving entity in the merger, will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Parent. Following the consummation of the merger, Forestar common stock will be
delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and regulations.

Background of the Merger 

        The Forestar board of directors continuously evaluates Forestar's strategic direction and business with a goal of maximizing stockholder value. On December 8, 2014, the Company issued a press release
approved by its board of directors announcing that Forestar's board of directors, working together with its management team and financial advisor, was exploring strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder
value. Thereafter, on May 12, 2015, the Company announced that, as a result of its review of strategic alternatives, the board had approved and initiated a plan to focus on growing the Company's core real estate
business, including harvesting cash flows from its non-core oil and gas business by significantly reducing capital expenditures and operating costs.

        On June 15, 2015, the chief executive officer of a publicly traded real estate operating company ("Party A") sent a letter to the Company's chief executive officer to express an interest in discussing a
potential combination of the Company and Party A, but no price or valuation was specified.

        On July 15, 2015, the chief executive officer of the Company participated in a telephone conference with the chief executive officer of Party A to elaborate on the Company's focus on the plan announced
on May 12, 2015.

        On August 6, 2015, the chief executive officer of Party A sent another letter to the chief executive officer of the Company, copying the Company's board of directors, reiterating Party A's desire to consider
a combination of the two companies and outlining the potential benefits of a combination. The letter did not include any indicative valuation of the Company. Forestar's closing stock price was $12.92 on
August 6, 2015.

Table of Contents

        On August 11, 2015, the Forestar board of directors held an in-person meeting, with members of Forestar management in attendance. Representatives of the Company's then-financial advisor (which was
not JMP) were also present during a portion of the meeting. Forestar management provided an overview of Party A and its strategy and certain financial information. The Company's financial advisor
summarized certain considerations with a possible combination of Party A and the Company, including relative trading activity and implied historical exchange ratios. After discussion among the board of
directors, management and its financial advisor, the board of directors determined to direct management to inform Party A that the Company was not interested in pursuing a transaction, among other reasons
due to the fact that the Company and Party A were pursuing different real estate strategies as Party A was focused on acquiring and holding income producing properties and the Company was principally a land
developer for single-family communities. After the meeting, Forestar's chief executive officer sent a letter to the chief executive officer of Party A advising that the Company's board of directors had determined
that exploration of a business combination with Party A at this time was not in the best interests of Forestar and its shareholders.

        On September 28, 2015, among other management and board of directors changes, the Company announced the appointment of Phillip J. Weber as its new chief executive officer, and that
James A. Rubright would be Forestar's non-executive chairman effective December 31, 2015. On October 2, 2015, the Company announced the appointment of Charles D. Jehl as the new chief financial officer
of the Company.

        On October 22, 2015, Forestar's management team held introductory meetings with a publicly traded real estate investment firm ("Party B") to explore Party B acquiring Forestar's community development
portfolio or all of the equity interests in the Company. This meeting arose out of discussions between a representative of Forestar and a representative of Party B who had a pre-existing personal relationship.
Forestar and Party B entered into a confidentiality agreement on November 13, 2015, and Party B initiated due diligence of the Company. Shortly thereafter, Party B informed the Company it would not proceed
with a transaction due to Party B's belief that Party B would not be able to offer a price at which the Company would be willing to transact.

        The board of directors of Forestar held an in-person meeting on November 10, 2015, with members of Forestar management in attendance. At the meeting, in connection with the board of directors' plan to
focus on the core business, the board of directors determined to engage financial advisors to commence the sales process for certain non-core assets, including specifically the sale of its hotel property in Austin,
Texas, and its oil and gas working interest assets in North Dakota. Forestar's closing stock price was $13.37 on November 10, 2015.

        In early December 2015, Bruce F. Dickson, then the Company's chief real estate officer, met with representatives of a private residential and commercial real estate company ("Party C") to discuss possible
strategic alternatives between Forestar and Party C. This meeting was arranged at the request of the Company as it continued to evaluate its strategy for the community development business.

        During the last two months of 2015 and in 2016 prior to the ultimate engagement of JMP as the Company's financial advisor in August 2016, the Forestar management team met with several potential
financial advisors and invited JMP and four other potential financial advisors to prepare materials and presentations for the Forestar board of directors regarding such firms' views on Forestar's business and
alternatives. Throughout 2016 and 2017, the Company continued to pursue its initiatives to reduce operating costs, exit certain non-core assets and focus on maximizing stockholder value. As the Company
narrowed its core business to community development and continued to divest certain non-core assets, Forestar management also worked with various advisors to consider future alternatives for Forestar in light
of the business challenges facing Forestar and the Company's future financial plan and prospects.

        On January 7, 2016, the Forestar board of directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Forestar management in attendance. Mr. Weber provided an update on ongoing initiatives with respect to the
Company's non-core assets, and Mr. Jehl provided information regarding net asset value scenarios for the Company as well as a review of its core business. The board of directors discussed these reviews and
the status of the core community development business, and discussed the strategic direction of the Company.

        On January 19 and January 20, 2016, Mr. Weber, Mr. Dickson and Michael Quinley, the Company's president—community development, met with representatives of Party C to introduce Mr. Weber and
Mr. Quinley to the Party C representatives and to further discuss possible strategic alternatives between Forestar and Party C. Party C had executed a confidentiality agreement with Forestar on January 12,
2016. Thereafter, the parties determined not to proceed with further discussions regarding a transaction due to a perceived lack of strategic alignment between the parties as Party C was focused on growing its
multifamily business, which Forestar was considering for opportunistic exit over time.

        On January 26, 2016, the Forestar board of directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Forestar management in attendance. At the meeting, the board of directors determined the Company's
multifamily business was non-core, and to opportunistically exit Forestar's multifamily portfolio and no longer allocate capital to new projects in that business.

        On February 8 and February 9, 2016, the Forestar board of directors held an in-person meeting, which members of Forestar management attended. At the meeting, a potential financial advisor made a
presentation to the board of directors regarding the advisor's observations regarding the Company, its market positioning, and the Company's strategic alternatives. The board of directors engaged in a discussion
regarding the Company's strategic alternatives, and in furtherance of the objective to focus on the Company's core community development business the board of directors directed management to commence
the process to market its timberland assets and to begin the process to determine potential values for legacy oil and gas and mineral assets. Forestar's closing stock price was $8.60 on February 9, 2016.

        In April 2016, a representative of a private real estate investment firm ("Party D") discussed with Mr. Quinley Party D's potential interest in an acquisition of the Company's community development
business in the course of Mr. Quinley's regular business interactions with such representative. Mr. Quinley had been acquainted with the Party D representative for over 30 years during which both Mr. Quinley
and the Party D representative had been employed by various firms associated with Atlanta-area real estate development activities or providing services thereto. After initial discussions, Party D executed a
confidentiality agreement with Forestar on April 19, 2016, and Mr. Quinley had additional discussions with the Party D representative during May 2016.

        In late April 2016, a representative of a private investment firm ("Party E") contacted a member of the Forestar board of directors (who is no longer a member of the board of directors) with whom the Party
E representative was already acquainted to inquire about a potential transaction with the Company. The Forestar director spoke with the representative of Party E regarding Forestar and its business (without
sharing any material non-public information). The director suggested that the Party E representative contact Mr. Weber if Party E was interested in engaging in further discussions regarding a potential
transaction with the Company, and no further contact from Party E was received by the Company in regard to a potential transaction.

        The Forestar board of directors held a regularly scheduled in-person meeting on May 9 and May 10, 2016, with members of Forestar management and representatives of two potential financial advisors
(neither of which were the potential financial advisor that presented at the February 8 and February 9, 2016 board of directors meeting) and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP ("Skadden"), the
Company's legal counsel, in attendance (with the two potential financial advisors and

Skadden in attendance for part of the meeting). At the meeting, Mr. Weber reviewed the evolution of considerations and decisions since October 2015 related to the Company's portfolio of assets, and discussed
with the board of directors certain historical financial information and pro forma community development information. Representatives of the first potential financial advisor joined the meeting to discuss their
recommendations, including strategic alternatives, repurchasing or refinancing indebtedness, valuation considerations for the Company's community development business and their recommendation to initiate a
tender offer for the Company's 8.500% senior secured notes due 2022. The second potential financial advisor then joined the meeting to discuss the Company's net asset value, potential deleveraging alternatives
and recommendations on strategic alternatives. After the presentations by the two potential financial advisors, Mr. Weber advised the board of directors that the Company had been approached by a financial
advisor (which was not a financial advisor that the board of directors was considering retaining) representing a publicly traded company, the identity of which had not been disclosed to Mr. Weber, that was
interested in engaging in discussions with the Company. The board of directors discussed the strategic alternatives for the community development business and considerations regarding the financial advisor the
Company may want to engage. Representatives of Skadden joined the meeting to discuss and respond to questions from the directors regarding their fiduciary duties with respect to the exploration of strategic
alternatives. After discussion of the various presentations and alternatives presented to the board of directors, the board of directors determined to initiate a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for the
Company's senior secured notes, and to continue to focus on the Company's core community development business. Forestar's closing stock price was $12.43 on May 10, 2016.

        After the board of directors meeting, the financial advisor that had contacted Mr. Weber prior to the board of directors meeting about potentially engaging in discussions with the Company disclosed to
Mr. Weber the identity of the advisor's client, a publicly traded homebuilder ("Party F"). On May 11, 2016, Mr. Weber and Mr. Quinley had an in-person meeting with representatives of Party F to discuss
Forestar and Party F and whether the parties would be interested in a potential transaction or other strategic business arrangement.

        On May 18, 2016, Mr. Weber, Mr. Jehl and Mr. Quinley had a follow-up meeting with representatives of Party F to discuss further whether the parties would be interested in a potential transaction or other
strategic business arrangement.

        On May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a confidentiality agreement with Party F, which agreement included a "standstill" provision (which "standstill" expired in accordance with its terms on
February 27, 2017).

        On June 1, 2016, Mr. Weber, Mr. Jehl, David M. Grimm, then the Company's chief administrative officer and general counsel, and Mr. Quinley met with representatives of Party F, including Party F's
financial advisor, and the parties discussed a potential strategic alliance and other potential business arrangements. In the days following, the parties and their advisors continued to discuss a potential
transaction.

        On June 6, 2016, Party F delivered a draft term sheet to Forestar proposing an equity investment by Party F in Forestar. The term sheet provided for a proposed investment in Forestar by Party F to acquire
a combination of common stock representing 19.9% of the fully diluted Forestar common shares outstanding prior to the issuance at a purchase price equal to the market value per share, and convertible
preferred stock representing an additional 20% of the fully diluted Forestar common shares outstanding on an as-converted basis. The term sheet provided that Party F would have proportional representation on
the Company's board of directors and on a newly formed investment committee composed of Forestar management and Party F representatives, and Party F would have certain veto rights at the board of
directors level and on the investment committee. The term sheet also provided that the Company would use the proceeds of the investment to pursue lot development projects in

which Party F would have rights to purchase a significant portion of the lots, and the parties would also enter into an agreement providing Party F with preferential rights to acquire developed lots from the
Company at market prices.

        On June 13, 2016, Mr. Quinley met with representatives of Party D and discussed Party D acquiring Forestar's community development portfolio.

        On June 16, 2016, the Forestar board of directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Forestar management in attendance. Mr. Weber reviewed the fact that several parties had previously expressed
an interest in Forestar's community development business (such as Party B, Party C and Party D), and discussed Party F's proposal and the status of conversations with Party F. In light of the potential interest in
the community development business and the Party F proposal, Forestar management recommended to the board of directors that the Company would benefit from engaging a financial advisor to assist with the
identification and evaluation of strategic alternatives, and noted that the Company had been in contact with several potential firms. Following discussions, the board of directors authorized Forestar management
(i) to continue discussions with potential financial advisors with a goal of identifying a firm for recommendation to the board of directors and (ii) to continue discussions with Party F to enable Party F to better
understand the value of the Company for purposes of its potential strategic investment and address other aspects of Party F's proposal.

        During June and July 2016, Forestar management reached out to and met with potential financial advisors regarding the Company. On June 21, 2016, Mr. Weber and Mr. Jehl held a telephone conference
with representatives of JMP to invite JMP to attend the August 2016 meeting of the Company's board of directors for discussions regarding the Company's strategic alternatives.

        On June 23, 2016, Mr. Jehl and other Forestar employees participated in a conference call with Party F and its financial advisor to discuss the potential strategic investment and Forestar's financial position.

        On June 29, 2016, Mr. Weber, Mr. Jehl and Mr. Quinley met with representatives of Party D to introduce Mr. Weber and Mr. Jehl and continue the discussions regarding Party D's potential acquisition of
Forestar's community development portfolio.

        On July 13, 2016, Forestar management, in furtherance of the process authorized by the board of directors to evaluate potential financial advisors, authorized JMP, in contemplation of potential formal
engagement, to reach out to five initial parties to discuss possible interest in a potential transaction with Forestar (with respect to the community development business or otherwise), including two private
investment firms ("Party G" and "Party H"), a real estate investment firm ("Party I"), a private owner and developer of mixed-use, master-planned communities ("Party J"), and a non-U.S. publicly traded real
estate firm ("Party K").

        On July 14, 2016, Mr. Weber, Mr. Jehl, Mr. Grimm and Mr. Quinley met with representatives of Party F at Party F's corporate offices to further discuss the potential strategic investment by Party F in
Forestar.

        Party H executed a confidentiality agreement with Forestar on July 21, 2016.

        On July 22, 2016, Mr. Weber met with representatives of Party F at its corporate offices to discuss valuation considerations with respect to Forestar and the terms of the potential strategic investment by
Party F.

        On July 26, 2016, Forestar delivered to Party F a revised draft of the term sheet regarding Party F's potential strategic investment in the Company, consistent with the general feedback to the term sheet
from the board of directors at the June 16, 2016 meeting. The term sheet contemplated an acquisition of 19.9% of the Company's common stock at an unspecified premium to the market price and eliminated the
proposed preferred stock investment, and, among other changes to Party F's proposed term sheet, limited Party F's board of directors veto rights and removed Party F's investment committee veto rights and
added a five-year customary standstill that limited Party F's ability to acquire more than 25% of the Company's common stock or to take certain other actions. Forestar's closing stock price was $12.24 on
July 26, 2016.

        On July 27, 2016, Party G and Party K each executed a confidentiality agreement with Forestar.

        On August 1, 2016, Mr. Rubright met with representatives of Party F at his home to further discuss the potential strategic investment by Party F in Forestar.

        On August 4, 2016, Party F delivered to the Company a revised draft of the term sheet regarding Party F's proposed strategic investment in the Company. The revised term sheet contemplated an acquisition
by Party F of 19.9% of the Company's common stock, and convertible preferred stock that, together with the common stock, would result in Party F owning 25% of the fully diluted Forestar common shares
outstanding on an as-diluted basis, at a purchase price of $13.75 per share in each case. Among other changes to the Forestar July 26, 2016 draft term sheet, the revised draft (i) included expanded board of
directors veto rights, (ii) reinstated certain of Party F's veto rights on the investment committee and (iii) provided for a more limited two-year standstill agreement that allowed Party F to acquire up to 30% of
the Company's common stock.

        The Forestar board of directors held an in-person meeting on August 8 and August 9, 2016, with members of Forestar management in attendance. Representatives of JMP and another potential financial
advisor were also in attendance for portions of the meeting. As the board of directors was evaluating which financial advisor it would engage, Forestar management invited JMP and the other potential financial
advisor to attend portions of the board of directors meeting, and each of JMP and the other financial advisor separately joined the meeting to discuss potential strategic alternatives that the Company might wish
to consider and valuation matters. JMP discussed with the board of directors three potential options for the Company: sale, liquidation or status quo with growth, and discussed the five parties contacted for
preliminary outreach in July, as well as additional potential transaction parties. After discussion of the various alternatives presented and considerations regarding the appropriate financial advisor, the board of
directors decided to engage in a process to explore a potential sale of the Company and approved the engagement of JMP to assist with the process (at no time did JMP participate in any discussions of the board
of directors regarding JMP's engagement). The Forestar board of directors' selection was based on JMP's reputation and experience and familiarity with Forestar and its business. The Forestar board of directors
also discussed Party F's most recent proposal. The board of directors determined that the proposed investment construct was problematic to Forestar because the proposed Party F governance rights were
excessive in comparison to the proposed level of investment. Shortly after the board of directors meeting, Forestar management informed Party F of these conclusions and the fact that the Company intended to
engage JMP to explore strategic alternatives. Thereafter, Party F advised Forestar management that Party F was not interested in participating in a formal process with other parties. Forestar's closing stock price
was $12.16 on August 9, 2016.

        On August 11, 2016, Party I executed a confidentiality agreement with Forestar.

        JMP was formally engaged on August 18, 2016 pursuant to the approval granted by the board of directors in the August 8 and August 9, 2016 meeting. Forestar's closing stock price was $12.25 on
August 18, 2016. Beginning on August 18, 2016 and through September, at the direction of the Company and consistent with direction of the board of directors to initiate a potential sale process, JMP reached
out to, or continued engagement with, 18 parties (including Parties A - K mentioned above, other than Party E, in light of their lack of response to the prior discussions, and Party D, who Forestar management
was dealing with directly at the time) to solicit interest in an acquisition of Forestar, including several parties that had reached out to JMP or Forestar inquiring about a possible transaction. The contacted parties
included public and private strategic acquirors, including national homebuilders, and private investment firms.

        On September 6, 2016, Forestar opened an electronic data room for potential acquirors that had executed confidentiality agreements.

        On September 14, 2016, a non-binding indication of interest was received from Party D based on the prior discussions between Party D and Forestar management. The indication of interest consisted of an
offer to purchase only Forestar's community development assets for $250 million. Forestar management had informed Party D that JMP had been retained by Forestar to assist it with evaluating strategic
alternatives for the Company as a whole. Also on that day, Party J executed a confidentiality agreement with Forestar and was granted access to the electronic data room shortly thereafter.

        On September 22, 2016, at the direction of the Company, JMP transmitted a process letter to the 10 parties included in the initial outreach group (including Party B and Parties G -K) that had expressed an
interest in a potential transaction inviting them to submit by no later than October 7, 2016 initial indications of interest to acquire Forestar. Forestar's closing stock price was $11.67 on September 22, 2016.

        On September 28, 2016, Forestar executed a confidentiality agreement with Party J with respect to information to be provided to Forestar by Party J.

        Throughout late September and October 2016, JMP and the Company's management held various telephone conferences and in-person meetings with the various parties considering a transaction to provide
further information on Forestar and its business.

        From September 26, 2016 to October 6, 2016, Mr. Weber, Mr. Jehl, Mr. Quinley, Mr. Burleson, the Company's Executive Vice President—Real Estate, West Region, other Forestar employees and
representatives of JMP held telephone or in-person conferences with each of Party H, Party J, Party G and a private investment firm ("Party L") to provide information regarding Forestar and its business. Party
L had initially inquired about purchasing the Company's receivables from the Cibolo Canyons Special Improvement District, but Party L subsequently contacted JMP to be involved in the potential sale process.
Party L executed a confidentiality agreement with Forestar on October 5, 2016 and was granted access to the electronic data room shortly thereafter.

        On October 7, 2016, Party G submitted an initial non-binding indication of interest for Forestar for an all-cash acquisition of Forestar at a preliminary valuation of $14.00 per share.

        On October 11, 2016, Mr. Jehl, Mr. Quinley, Mr. Burleson and other Forestar employees and representatives of JMP held separate telephone conferences with representatives of a publicly traded
homebuilder ("Party M") and a publicly traded real estate investment trust ("Party N") to provide an overview of Forestar and its community development business by project and market, each of whom had
been part of the initial outreach group contacted by JMP. Party M had executed a confidentiality agreement with Forestar on September 29, 2016 and Party N had executed a confidentiality agreement with
Forestar on September 26, 2016, and each were granted access to the electronic data room shortly after executing such confidentiality agreements.

        On October 14, 2016, Party J submitted an initial non-binding indication of interest. The indication of interest provided for a non-cash, all-stock private-to-public merger transaction pursuant to which Party
J and Forestar would merge with Forestar as the surviving corporation, and Forestar stockholders would own approximately 13%-14% of the merged company. The offer implied a valuation of Forestar of
approximately $600 million to $625 million based on Party J's proposed valuation of itself (a price per share of $14.05 to $14.64). Party J indicated that it would consider including a cash portion of the purchase
price if Forestar preferred such a structure. In response to Party J's initial indication of interest, JMP requested that Party J provide financial information to support the valuation of Party J included in its initial
indication of interest.

        On October 18, 2016, Party F withdrew its earlier offer that had valued the Company at $13.75 per share, informing the Company that it was not interested in an acquisition of the entire company and that it
did not wish to participate in the potential sale process. Party F indicated that it would not work on a potential strategic investment in the Company until the potential sale process was concluded. Also

on that day, Party J provided initial diligence information in response to Forestar's request to provide financial information to support the Party J valuation included in its initial indication of interest.

        On October 19, 2016, the Forestar board of directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Forestar management and representatives of JMP and Skadden in attendance (with JMP in attendance for
part of the meeting). The representative of Skadden reviewed with the members of the Forestar board of directors their fiduciary duties. JMP summarized the status of the potential sale process to date, noting
that of the parties that had been contacted as part of the initial outreach group or that had otherwise engaged in discussions with Forestar as noted above, nine (including Party A) had either declined to
participate in the process or had withdrawn from the process after executing a confidentiality agreement with the Company. Four of the parties had submitted initial indications of interest: Party F (at a value of
$13.75 per share, which offer had been withdrawn on October 18, 2016), Party D (at an implied value of $5.87 per share for the community development business only), Party G (at a value of $14.00 per share)
and Party J (at an implied value of $14.05 to $14.64 per share based on Party J's valuation of itself included in its indication of interest). The board of directors engaged in discussion with the JMP
representatives regarding the process and the parties that had indicated, or were expected to indicate based on discussions with JMP, interest in a transaction with Forestar. Forestar's closing stock price was
$11.20 on October 19, 2016.

        Also on October 19, 2016, an initial non-binding indication of interest was received from Party N, which contemplated that Party N would contribute a master planned community land portfolio to Forestar
in exchange for Forestar common stock, preferred equity, or other consideration to be determined. Party N did not include an indicative valuation in its indication of interest. After discussions between
representatives of the Company and Party N regarding the proposed transaction, including the possibility of Party N providing debt financing to an acquiror of the Company, the parties concluded that a
transaction involving Forestar and Party N was not a strategic fit given Party N's proposed transaction structure, and Party N did not continue in the potential sale process.

        On October 24, 2016, Mr. Jehl, Mr. Quinley, Mr. Burleson and other Forestar employees and representatives of JMP held a telephone conference with representatives of a private community developer
("Party O") to provide an overview of Forestar and its community development business by project and market. Party O had executed a confidentiality agreement with Forestar on October 11, 2016 and was
granted access to the electronic data room shortly thereafter.

        Also on October 24, 2016, consistent with the discussions at the October 19, 2016 meeting of the Forestar board of directors, Forestar management instructed JMP to initiate an expanded outreach to six
additional potential acquirors, including Starwood, a private real estate developer ("Party P") and investment firms and publicly traded real estate companies. In the days following, JMP reached out to all six
parties to solicit their interest in participating in the potential sale process. On that same day, JMP transmitted a detailed request list to Party J for financial information so that Forestar, with the assistance of its
advisors, could assess Party J's proposed valuation of itself.

        Starwood executed a confidentiality agreement with Forestar on October 24, 2016 and was granted access to the electronic data room shortly thereafter.

        On October 26, 2016, Mr. Burleson and other Forestar employees and representatives of JMP held a telephone conference with representatives of Party L to provide an overview of Forestar and its
community development business by project and market.

        Also on October 26, 2016, Mr. Weber and Mr. Jehl and representatives of JMP met with representatives of Party G to discuss the potential sale process and the progress made by Party G to date, including
the terms of its indication of interest. The parties discussed arranging project level tours for representatives of Party G in November 2016.

        On the same day, Mr. Weber and Mr. Jehl and representatives of JMP also met with Party O and discussed Party O's continued interest in purchasing the Company or its community development assets.

        On October 27, 2016, Party J provided additional high level financial due diligence information. Forestar, in consultation with JMP, did not consider such information sufficient to assess Party J's proposed
valuation of itself. At the Company's direction, JMP communicated to Party J the need for additional due diligence materials in order for the Company to assess Party J's proposed valuation of itself.

        On November 1, 2016, Party G informed JMP that it wanted to introduce another private investment firm into the process ("Party Q") to evaluate the potential transaction as a potential partner with Party
G. Representatives of JMP spoke with representatives of Party Q and Party Q executed a confidentiality agreement on November 4, 2016 and was granted access to the electronic data room shortly thereafter.
Party Q began to work with Party G to evaluate the potential transaction as potential partners.

        On November 7, 2016, Party O submitted an initial non-binding indication of interest for an all-cash acquisition of the Company at $14.50 per share.

        The Forestar board of directors met at an in-person meeting on November 7 and November 8, 2016, with members of Forestar management and representatives of JMP in attendance (with JMP in
attendance for part of the meeting). Forestar management and JMP provided an update of the potential sale process, including an overview of the six additional parties contacted, and an overview of potential
strategic alternatives for the Company. Forestar's closing stock price was $11.35 on November 7, 2016.

        On November 9, 2016, Party P executed a confidentiality agreement with Forestar and was granted access to the electronic data room shortly thereafter.

        In November 2016, based on discussions at the board of directors meeting on November 7 and November 8, 2016, Forestar determined to invite Starwood and Party P (based on discussions with such
parties) and Party G and Party Q, Party J and Party O (based on the terms of the initial indications of interest submitted by, and discussions with, such parties) to participate in the second round of the potential
sale process. Such parties were included in the second round of the potential sale process based on the potential benefit to the Company's stockholders of the participation of such parties in light of their
perceived interest level in and ability to consummate a transaction and in the interest of furthering a competitive process. Forestar determined not to invite Party D into the second round due to the lower
valuation and structural impediments to a transaction compared to the other prospective acquirors. During the course of the second round of the potential sale process, the Company arranged various site tours
and telephone conferences at the request of the potential acquirors in connection with their due diligence, as detailed below.

        On November 11, 2016, Mr. Jehl and other Forestar employees and Forestar's external tax counsel participated in a conference call with Party G in which the parties discussed structuring alternatives for a
potential transaction.

        On November 15, 2016, Mr. Jehl, Mr. Quinley, Mr. Burleson and other Forestar employees and representatives of JMP held a telephone conference with representatives of Starwood to provide an overview
of Forestar and its community development business by project and market.

        From November 16 to November 18, 2016, Mr. Weber, Mr. Jehl, Mr. Quinley, Mr. Burleson, representatives of JMP and other Forestar employees held in-person meetings, and Forestar representatives
conducted project tours for, representatives of Party G and Party Q. Forestar provided Party G and Party Q with additional information regarding Forestar and an update on the core business and status of the
non-core business and dispositions.

        On December 2, 2016, Mr. Burleson met with representatives of Party P, with Mr. Jehl and other Forestar employees and representatives of JMP joining by telephone conference. Forestar provided an
overview of Forestar and its community development business by project and market. Also on that day, at the direction of the Company, JMP contacted three additional parties that had expressed interest in
providing financing to Party O in the potential sale process.

        On December 6, 2016, Party P submitted an initial, non-binding indication of interest for an all-cash acquisition of Forestar at a price of $15.00 per share.

        Also on January 3, 2017, Party O informed the Company that it would not be submitting a final offer because Party O was only interested in purchasing the community development assets of Forestar and
not the equity of the Company (including the Company's liabilities), and Party O had not yet been able to arrange financing for a transaction.

        On January 5, 2017, the Forestar board of directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Forestar management and representatives of JMP and Skadden in attendance (with JMP in attendance for
part of the meeting). The representatives of JMP provided an update on the potential sale process and engagement with the remaining parties, including property tours and significant meetings, and an overview
of the expected final round bids based on discussions with the interested parties. The representative of Skadden reviewed with the members of the Forestar board of directors their fiduciary duties with respect to
the potential sale process.

        On January 6, 2017, Mr. Jehl and other Forestar employees and Forestar's external tax counsel participated in a follow-up conference call with Party P to continue discussing the structuring options for the
transaction.

        On January 10, 2017, Mr. Jehl, Mr. Burleson and other Forestar employees participated in telephone conferences with Party G and Party Q to discuss due diligence matters and an overview of the West
region assets.

        On January 12, 2017, Mr. Weber and Mr. Jehl and representatives of JMP met with Mr. Moser and Mr. David Baker, a Vice President of Starwood, in Austin, Texas, to discuss financial and business due
diligence matters for the potential transaction between the Company and Starwood.

        On January 13, 2017, based on feedback from the remaining parties regarding the status of due diligence in light of the January 20, 2017 deadline for final offers, the Company determined to extend the
deadline for final offers from January 20, 2017 to January 27, 2017, and thereafter JMP informed the remaining parties of the extended deadline.

        On January 16, 2017, Mr. Weber participated in a conference call with a representative of Party P to discuss the possible acquisition of Forestar by Party P.

        On January 19, 2017, Party G and Party Q informed JMP that they would not be submitting a final offer for the acquisition of Forestar because based on their additional due diligence reviews of the
Company, the valuation of the Company would be substantially lower than the values provided in Party G's initial indication of interest. Party P also informed JMP that it would not be submitting a final offer
for Forestar for the same reasons but it expressed an interest in acquiring solely the Company's community development assets if a transaction for sale of the entire Company was not consummated.

        On January 27, 2017, Party J submitted its second non-binding offer for a merger of Forestar and Party J, which continued to reflect a stock-for-stock merger pursuant to which Party J would acquire
Forestar and become a public company. The offer included a proposed value of Party J within the range provided in its initial indication of interest, and Forestar stockholders would own approximately 15% of
the merged company. Party J did not submit a revised draft of the merger agreement with its offer.

        On January 28, 2017, the Forestar board of directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Forestar management and representatives of JMP in attendance (with JMP in attendance for part of the
meeting). The representatives of JMP provided an update on the potential sale process, identifying the parties that had withdrawn from the process and that only Party J had provided a final offer and

that the January 27, 2017 deadline for such offers had passed, and that Party J continued to propose a stock-for-stock transaction without supplying necessary data for the Company to assess Party J's own
valuation. After consultation with JMP, the board of directors determined that, in addition to Party J, the Company should continue to engage with Starwood to encourage submission of a final offer and with
Party G and Party Q with the goal of encouraging Party G and Party Q to reengage in the potential sale process and submit a final offer. Forestar's closing stock price was $13.00 on January 27, 2017.

        On January 31, 2017, JMP had a telephone conference with representatives of Party J to discuss their offer and to request the necessary information for the Company to assess the proposed valuation of
Party J.

        On February 1, 2017, Party J provided additional financial due diligence information consisting primarily of a third party liquidation analysis at a value substantially below Party J's proposed valuation in
its final offer, and which Forestar, in consultation with JMP, did not consider sufficient to substantiate Party J's proposed valuation of itself.

        On February 8, 2017, Starwood submitted its non-binding second offer, which included an offer to acquire the Company for a price of $13.65 per share and proposed a 30-day exclusivity period to continue
its due diligence and execute transaction documents, followed by a post-signing due diligence period of 30 days, with Starwood having the right to terminate the merger agreement in its sole discretion during
such 30-day diligence period. Starwood indicated to Forestar management that it had reduced the offer price from $15.00 per share price included in Starwood Land's initial indication of interest as a result of
findings during the course of its due diligence investigation of the Company, including, among other things, the fact that a greater percentage of the Company's residential lots were under contract than Starwood
had initially assumed and Starwood's belief that obtaining entitlements for one of the Company's assets was less feasible or likely to take longer than Starwood had initially assumed.

        On February 13 and February 14, 2017, the Forestar board of directors held an in-person meeting, with members of Forestar management and representatives of JMP and Skadden in attendance (with JMP
and Skadden in attendance for part of the meeting). JMP informed the board of directors that JMP had reached out to Party G after the January 28, 2017 board of directors meeting to encourage Party G and
Party Q to reengage in the potential sale process and submit a final offer, and Party G had declined on behalf of both such parties. In addition to the offers from Starwood and Party J, the board of directors
discussed the Company's 2016 performance, historical community development results and projected performance, key performance indicators, inventory of lots, historical and projected SG&A targets. The
board of directors also reviewed potential net asset value scenarios, which scenarios compared net asset values in the event of the Company's dissolution and winding up of its affairs or the continuation of the
Company's business plan at different levels of investment (which scenarios are set forth in the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Projected Financial Information—Alternative Net Asset Value
Scenarios"). The Skadden representative reviewed with the board of directors the process and potential timing for the Company to dissolve or wind up its affairs under Delaware law. JMP and Forestar
management reviewed with the board of directors the potential recoveries for stockholders under management's estimates of asset values, liabilities and carry costs, including sensitivities on a per share basis
depending on the estimated sales price of the Company's community development business. The board of directors engaged in a discussion of the offers from Starwood and Party J and the other strategic options
available to the Company on a going-forward basis, including the potential sale of the community development portfolio combined with liquidation of the remaining non-core assets and dissolution and winding
up of the Company's affairs. JMP noted that, based on Party J's valuation of Party J's stock included in Party J's second offer and the due diligence materials provided by Party J, the implied per share value of
the Party J offer was in a range of $10.96 per share to $16.00 per share. The board of directors discussed that, as a private company, Party J's valuation of itself was subject to various assumptions which would
require significant additional due diligence to assess, as well as other considerations with respect to Party J's stock merger

proposal, including the fact that the Company's stockholders would own less than 20% of the merged entity. The representative of Skadden reviewed with the members of the Forestar board of directors their
fiduciary duties in the context of the two offers. Following discussion by the board of directors, the board of directors directed Forestar management to continue to engage with Starwood and Party J, and to
continue to request the due diligence items from Party J necessary for the Company to further assess the valuation of Party J in light of the proposed stock-for-stock transaction structure. The board of directors
directed JMP to inform Starwood that it should raise its offer price in order to remain competitive on value and if it desired to enter into an exclusivity agreement with the Company. Forestar's closing stock
price was $13.25 on February 13, 2017.

        On February 16, 2017, representatives of JMP held a telephonic meeting with Starwood in which it was conveyed to Starwood that the Forestar board of directors had determined that Starwood's $13.65
per share offer was insufficient and that the Forestar board of directors was unwilling to grant an exclusivity period longer than 30 days or a "diligence out" allowing Starwood to unilaterally terminate the
merger agreement.

        On the same day, JMP sent a supplemental detailed due diligence request list to Party J and participated in a telephone conference with representatives of Party J to discuss the requests and the need for the
information to allow Forestar to further assess the value of Party J's offer. Later that day, Party J informed JMP that it was withdrawing from the potential sale process, and did not give a reason for the
withdrawal.

        On February 21, 2017, Starwood submitted another non-binding indication of interest to the Company, increasing its offer price from $13.65 per share to $14.25 per share, and proposing a 30-day
exclusivity agreement to complete due diligence and negotiate the transaction documents. On the same day, Kirkland & Ellis LLP ("Kirkland"), Starwood's legal counsel, delivered a revised draft of the merger
agreement to Skadden.

        On February 24, 2017, the Forestar board of directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Forestar management and representatives of JMP and Skadden in attendance (with JMP in attendance for
part of the meeting). JMP provided a process update and overview, and noted that with Party J's refusal to provide the requested diligence information and withdrawal from the potential sale process, Starwood
was the sole party that remained in the potential sale process. JMP reviewed Starwood's revised offer of $14.25 per share, which was the highest cash final offer received by the Company. The representative
from Skadden discussed the proposed exclusivity agreement and several points in the revised draft of the merger agreement submitted by Starwood. After discussion, the board of directors directed Forestar
management to seek improvement of certain terms in the merger agreement, including regarding termination fees, interim operating covenants, closing conditions and the outside date for the merger, as a
condition to entering into the exclusivity agreement with Starwood.

        Following the board of directors meeting, representatives of JMP reached out to Starwood to discuss the matters raised at the meeting to seek improvement to certain terms in exchange for Forestar
agreeing to enter into an exclusivity agreement with Starwood.

        On February 27, 2017, the Forestar board of directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Forestar management and representatives of JMP and Skadden in attendance (with JMP in attendance for
part of the meeting). JMP reported on its discussions with Starwood, including Starwood's requirement of a 30-day exclusivity period in order to continue pursuing a transaction. JMP updated the board of
directors on Starwood's response to issues raised with respect to certain terms in the merger agreement and Skadden summarized the proposed exclusivity agreement. After discussion, the board of directors
authorized Forestar management to enter into a 30-day exclusivity agreement with Starwood and to continue the negotiation of the merger agreement during this period. Later that day, Forestar and Starwood
entered into a 30-day exclusivity agreement, with the exclusivity period expiring on March 29, 2017. Forestar's closing stock price was $13.45 on February 27, 2017.

        During the exclusivity period, Starwood and its advisors worked to complete its due diligence of Forestar, including via access to an electronic data room provided by Forestar, while Starwood's and
Forestar management and advisors worked to finalize the merger agreement and other definitive transaction documents.

        On March 3, 2017, Skadden provided Kirkland with a revised draft of the merger agreement. On March 18, 2017, Kirkland provided Skadden with a revised draft of the merger agreement. On March 24,
2017, Skadden provided Kirkland with a revised draft of the merger agreement. During this period, representatives from Skadden and Kirkland engaged in numerous telephonic meetings to discuss the merger
agreement.

        On March 27, 2017, the Forestar board of directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Forestar management and representatives of JMP and Skadden in attendance (with JMP in attendance for
part of the meeting). JMP provided an update on the progress of Starwood's due diligence process and that Starwood continued to seek information and desired to perform additional analysis but that Starwood's
advisors had made substantial progress in their due diligence review. JMP noted that Starwood had originally requested a 21 day extension to the exclusivity period, but after further discussion between
Starwood and Forestar, had reduced its request to an extension to April 14, 2017. The representative of Skadden provided an overview of the status of negotiation of the merger agreement, including significant
open items. Following discussion among the directors, the board of directors authorized extending the exclusivity period to April 14, 2017.

        During the period from March 27, 2017 to April 13, 2017, Forestar's and Starwood's management and advisors worked to finalize the definitive transaction documents and Starwood's due diligence review
of Forestar.

        On April 3, 2017, Kirkland provided Skadden with a revised draft of the merger agreement, which included consents of various counterparties to Forestar joint ventures as a closing condition to the merger.
Forestar and Starwood and their representatives discussed the approach to these consents over the next several days and determined to seek to obtain certain consents prior to the execution of the merger
agreement if possible.

        On April 6, 2017, Skadden provided Kirkland with a revised draft of the merger agreement.

        On April 10, 2017, Kirkland provided Skadden with Starwood's proposal on the key remaining open issues in the merger agreement, including the joint venture counterparty closing condition, termination
fees and expense reimbursement triggers and amounts and expanding the divestiture condition. Later that day, Skadden and Kirkland discussed and negotiated the open issues, and Kirkland provided Skadden
with drafts of the Starwood equity commitment letter and limited guarantee.

        From April 10 through April 13, 2017, representatives of the Company and Starwood further negotiated, and reached resolution on, certain open points in the merger agreement, which included, among
others, the lack of the joint venture counterparty consents condition, termination fees and expense reimbursement triggers and amounts and the scope of the divestiture condition, and the terms and conditions of
the Starwood limited guarantee.

        On April 12, 2016, Forestar's board of directors held a telephonic meeting to consider the Starwood offer and the terms of the merger agreement. Forestar management and representatives of JMP and
Skadden were in attendance (with JMP in attendance for part of the meeting). Skadden's representative reviewed the director fiduciary duties and other legal matters, and provided an overview of the status of
the terms of the merger agreement and the resolution of certain issues, including that the parties had obtained consents from certain joint venture counterparties and that the associated closing condition had been
removed from the merger agreement. Skadden's representative noted that certain issues remained open in the merger agreement, including with respect to termination fees and expense reimbursement amounts
and triggers, and the board of directors provided guidance to Forestar

management and Skadden as to the acceptable approach to such issues. After discussing the transaction with Forestar management and the representatives of JMP and Skadden, the board of directors determined
to reconvene the following afternoon to consider approval of the transaction. The board of directors directed Skadden to discuss and attempt to resolve with Kirkland the remaining open points, including the
triggers for the expense reimbursement provisions. Representatives of Skadden and Kirkland held telephonic meetings to discuss these open issues and finalized the merger agreement.

        On April 13, 2017, Starwood informed the Company that the Starwood investment committee met that morning to consider the transaction and approved the merger.

        In the afternoon of April 13, 2017, the Forestar board of directors convened a telephonic meeting to consider the Starwood offer and the terms of the merger agreement. Forestar management and
representatives of JMP and Skadden were in attendance (with JMP in attendance for part of the meeting). Skadden's representatives reviewed the director fiduciary duties and other legal matters and the terms of
the merger agreement, and confirmed that all open issues with respect to the merger agreement and other transaction documents had been satisfactorily resolved, including with respect to termination fees and
expense reimbursement amounts and triggers. JMP provided an overview of the potential sale process, including that 29 parties had either been contacted or contacted the Company or JMP during the process
that launched in August 2016 (or had been in previous contact with Forestar as discussed above), that 22 parties had executed a confidentiality agreement in relation to a potential transaction (none of which
contained a "standstill" provision, except for the confidentiality agreement with Party F, as noted above), that 8 parties had submitted initial indications of interest and were invited to conduct further due
diligence and that two parties (Starwood and Party J) had submitted final offers, with Party J subsequently withdrawing its offer. JMP reviewed with the board of directors JMP's financial analysis of the $14.25
per share consideration to be received in the merger and rendered to the board of directors an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 13, 2017, to the effect that, as of that date and
based on and subject to the various assumptions and limitations set forth in its opinion, the $14.25 per share consideration to be received by the holders of Forestar common stock (other than Merger Parent and
its affiliates) in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. After discussing the proposed transaction and considering the presentations by Skadden and JMP, the Forestar board of
directors unanimously determined the merger with Merger Parent to be advisable and in the best interests of Forestar's stockholders, determined to approve the merger agreement and resolved to recommend
adoption of the merger agreement by Forestar's stockholders. Following the meeting, Forestar confirmed to Starwood that it had obtained its required board approval and the merger agreement was executed by
the parties in the evening of April 13, 2017.

        Later on April 13, 2017, the parties issued a press release announcing the execution of the merger agreement.

Recommendation of the Forestar Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger 

Recommendation of our Board of Directors

        The Forestar board of directors, after considering the various factors described below, (i) unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Forestar and its stockholders, (ii) declared the merger agreement advisable under Delaware law and (iii) unanimously approved, adopted
and authorized the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.

        Forestar's Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (i) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (ii) "FOR" the proposal to approve, by non-binding advisory

meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Reasons for the Merger

        In evaluating the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, our board of directors consulted with our management team and our outside legal and
financial advisors and, in reaching its decision to approve the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, our board of directors considered a number of
factors, including the following material factors which it viewed as supporting its decision to approve and recommend approval of the merger and the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders:

• the fact that the price proposed by Starwood reflected extensive negotiations between the parties and their respective advisors, and represented what in the judgment of the board of directors of
the Company was the highest value final offer that the Company received for the shares of Company Common Stock after a competitive solicitation of interest; 

• the fact that the Company considered a variety of strategic alternatives over an extensive approximately two year period; 

• the fact that the Company sought offers to purchase from a broad group of potential bidders, including financial sponsors and strategic bidders, 22 of whom entered into confidentiality
agreements with the Company and received information related to the Company, and of all such bidders, Starwood's offer was the highest value final offer and the only transaction reasonably
capable of execution in the judgment of the board of directors of the Company; 

• the fact that the merger consideration of $14.25 per share to be received by the Company stockholders in the merger represents a premium of 8.3% over the Company's 90-day volume weighted
average price for the period ended April 12, 2017; 

• the Company's current and historical financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, strategic options and prospects, as well as the Company's future financial plan and prospects; 

• the perceived challenges and risks, and the general and administrative costs, of continuing as a stand-alone public company and the assessment by the board of directors of the Company that no
other internally developed alternatives were reasonably likely in the near term to create greater value for the Company's stockholders than the merger, taking into account business, competitive,
industry and market risks; 

• the financial analyses presented by JMP Securities LLC, which we refer to as "JMP," as well as the oral opinion of JMP delivered to our board of directors on April 13, 2017, and subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion by JMP, dated April 13, 2017, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to holders of the Company's common
stock (other than Merger Parent and its affiliates) of the $14.25 per share consideration, which opinion was based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken, as more fully described under "—Opinion of Forestar's Financial Advisor", and in considering JMP's opinion, our board
of directors noted that JMP had informed the board of directors on January 3, 2017, and reaffirmed to the board of directors prior to execution of the merger agreement, that during the two year
period ended April 13, 2017, JMP had not been engaged by Forestar or Starwood Land Ventures, and there was no potential engagement pending with such persons, other than in its role as
financial advisor to the Company in connection with the merger, and that JMP believed that it did not have any relationships with Starwood that would prevent JMP from acting independently as
the Company's financial advisor in connection with the merger;

• the current state of the economy and uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic conditions both in the near term and the long term, generally, and within our industry in particular which could
reduce revenue generated by our projects; 

• the fact that the merger consideration is all cash, which provides liquidity and certainty of value to the Company's stockholders and does not expose them to the potential execution risks
associated with our business, the achievability of our financial projections and the risk associated with the possibility that even if our strategic plan is successfully executed, the market may not
reflect such execution in our stock price; 

• the fact that the termination fee of $20 million payable by us in certain circumstances was viewed by our board of directors, after consultation with our advisors, as reasonable and not likely to
preclude any other party from making a competing acquisition proposal; 

• the fact that the expense reimbursement of $3 million or $4 million, as applicable, payable by us if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances was viewed by our board of
directors, after consultation with our advisors, as reasonable; 

• the reasonable likelihood that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement would be completed based on, among other things, Starwood's size, financial liquidity
and proven ability to complete large acquisition transactions on agreed terms, its extensive ownership, development and operating experience in the real estate industry and the $40 million
termination fee Merger Parent would be required to pay us if, under certain circumstances, the merger agreement were terminated prior to consummation of the merger; 

• the lack of a financing condition for the merger, the amount to be committed by SOF-X U.S. Holdings pursuant to the equity commitment letter that would, together with the Company's cash on
hand, cover the aggregate consideration to be paid pursuant to the merger, and the guarantee of SOF-X U.S. Holdings of certain payment obligations of Merger Parent under the merger
agreement; 

• the Company's ability, under circumstances described in the merger agreement, to provide information to and engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party that makes an unsolicited
bona fide acquisition proposal if the board of directors, prior to taking any such actions, determines in good faith that such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal and the fact that none of the confidentiality agreements entered into by the Company in the potential sales process contains a "standstill"
provision that remains effective; 

• the ability of our board of directors, under circumstances described in the merger agreement, to withdraw, modify or amend the board's recommendation that the Company's stockholders vote to
adopt the merger agreement, subject to payment of a termination fee of $20 million if the merger agreement is terminated in such case; 

• our ability to terminate the merger agreement, under certain circumstances, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a superior proposal if our board of directors determines, after
consultation with advisors and after taking into account any changes to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by Merger Parent, that the superior proposal continues to constitute a superior
proposal, upon payment of a termination fee of $20 million; 

• the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, which were reviewed by our board of directors in consultation with our advisors, and the fact that such terms were derived from arm's-length
negotiations among the parties;

• the belief of Forestar's board of directors that there are a limited number of potential purchasers of the Company based on, among other things, strategic fit and financial ability; 

• the fact that the merger agreement would be subject to adoption by our common stockholders, and our common stockholders would be free to reject the merger by voting against the merger for
any reason, including if a higher offer were to be made prior to the stockholders meeting (although we may be required to pay expense reimbursement of up to $4 million in such circumstances
or, if we subsequently were to enter into a definitive agreement relating to and/or consummate an acquisition proposal, a termination fee of $20 million under certain circumstances); and 

• the fact that stockholders who do not vote to adopt the merger agreement and who follow certain prescribed procedures are entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law.

        Our board of directors also considered the following potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger, the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement:

• the fact that the merger would preclude our common stockholders from having an opportunity to participate in any future performance of our assets, future earnings growth, future appreciation of
our common share value or future dividends that could be expected if our strategic plans were successfully implemented; 

• the fact that receipt of the all-cash merger consideration would generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

• the risk that the merger could be delayed or not completed; 

• the fact that, although our board of directors has determined that the merger is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders and reflects the best price reasonably
available in a sale of the Company at this time, and despite the fact that we conducted an extensive marketing process, with the assistance of our financial advisor, there can be no assurances that
another alternative would not have resulted in a higher amount per share than the price payable pursuant to the merger; 

• the significant costs involved in connection with entering into and completing the merger and the substantial time and effort of management required to complete the merger, which may disrupt
the Company's business operations; 

• the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger, which could delay or prevent us from undertaking acquisition, development, redevelopment, disposition and
other business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the proposed transactions and generally change the manner in which we have conducted our business and operations in the past;

• the risk that the pending transactions or failure to complete the merger may negatively impact our relationships with our lenders, stockholders, joint venture partners and other business partners,
and may divert attention away from the day-to-day operation of our business; 

• the risk that the conditions to the merger may not be satisfied, including if holders of 20% or more of our common stock properly exercise appraisal rights; 

• our inability to solicit competing acquisition proposals and the possibility that the $20 million termination fee payable by us upon the termination of the merger agreement under the
circumstances described in the merger agreement could discourage other potential bidders from making a competing bid to acquire us;

• the fact that our exclusive remedy in the event the merger agreement is terminated by Merger Parent in certain circumstances would be limited to a reverse termination fee payable by Merger
Parent in the amount of $40 million; and 

• the fact that some of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement that are different from, or in addition
to, those of our common stockholders.

        The foregoing discussion is not meant to be exhaustive, but summarizes the material factors considered by the Forestar board of directors in its consideration of the merger. After considering these and
other factors, the Forestar board of directors concluded that the potential benefits of the merger outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In view of the variety of factors considered by the Forestar board of
directors and the complexity of these factors, the Forestar board of directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its
determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Forestar board of directors applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different weights to
different factors. Based upon the totality of the information presented to and considered by the Forestar board of directors, the Forestar board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the
consummation of the merger in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement and recommends that Forestar stockholders adopt the merger agreement.

Opinion of Forestar's Financial Advisor 

        The Company has retained JMP as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. In connection with this engagement, Forestar requested that JMP evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view,
to holders of Forestar common stock (other than Merger Parent and its affiliates) of the $14.25 per share consideration to be received by such holders in the merger. On April 13, 2017, at a meeting of Forestar's
board of directors at which the merger was approved, JMP rendered to the board an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated April 13, 2017, to the effect that, as of that date and based on
and subject to the matters described in its opinion, the $14.25 per share consideration to be received by the holders of Forestar common stock (other than Merger Parent and its affiliates) in the merger was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of JMP's written opinion, dated April 13, 2017, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The description of JMP's opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
JMP's opinion. JMP's opinion was provided to Forestar's board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the merger. JMP's opinion did not address the underlying
decision of Forestar to proceed with or effect the merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative strategy or transaction that might exist for Forestar. JMP's opinion does
not constitute a recommendation as to how Forestar's board of directors or any shareholder should act or vote with respect to the merger or any other matter. Forestar's stockholders are urged to
read carefully JMP's opinion in its entirety.

        For purposes of its opinion, JMP:

• reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft dated April 12, 2017 of the merger agreement; 

• reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Forestar, including Forestar's audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and
2014;

• reviewed certain financial projections provided to JMP by Forestar relating to Forestar and its community development projects, as well as to the estimated sale value of Forestar's multifamily
assets (as summarized in "—Projected Financial Information"), and certain other historical and current financial and business information provided to JMP by Forestar, including certain third
party appraisals and other purchase price information from letters of intent and draft purchase agreements provided to JMP by Forestar relating to certain other real estate assets of Forestar; 

• held discussions regarding the operations, financial condition and prospects of Forestar with the senior management of Forestar; 

• reviewed, for informational purposes, the premiums paid in certain publicly announced mergers and acquisitions transactions in certain real estate industries; 

• reviewed the current and historical trading prices and volume of Forestar common stock; 

• considered the results of Forestar's efforts, with JMP's assistance, to solicit indications of interest and definitive proposals from certain third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of
Forestar; and 

• performed such other studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other factors as JMP deemed appropriate.

        In arriving at its opinion, JMP, with Forestar's consent, (i) relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information from public sources or which was provided to JMP by or on behalf of
Forestar or otherwise reviewed by JMP, without independent verification, (ii) did not assume any responsibility for independently verifying such information, and (iii) relied on the assurances of the senior
management of Forestar that it was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading. In addition, with Forestar's consent, JMP did not make any independent
evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Forestar (with respect to any of its community development projects or otherwise), nor was JMP furnished with any such
evaluations or appraisals except as described above. With respect to the financial projections referred to above and any other forecasts or forward-looking information, JMP assumed, at the direction of the
senior management of Forestar, that such projections, forecasts and information were reasonably prepared and reflected the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of such management as to
the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Forestar and the other matters covered thereby, and JMP relied on such information in arriving at its opinion. With respect to the third party
appraisals and other purchase price information from letters of intent and draft purchase agreements referred to above, JMP assumed, at the direction of the senior management of Forestar, that such third party
appraisals and other purchase price information represented reasonable estimates of the values of the assets of Forestar to which they relate, and JMP relied on such information in arriving at its opinion.

        In addition, in arriving at its opinion, JMP assumed, with Forestar's consent, that (i) all material information JMP requested from Forestar during the scope of its engagement had been provided to JMP
fully and in good faith, (ii) the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement (the final terms and conditions of which JMP assumed would not
differ in any respect material to JMP's analysis from the aforementioned draft that JMP reviewed), without any waiver, modification or amendment of any material terms or conditions, (iii) the representations
and warranties made by the parties to the merger agreement were and would be true and correct in all respects material to JMP's analysis, (iv) all governmental and third party consents, approvals and
agreements necessary for the consummation of the merger would be obtained without any adverse effect on Forestar or the merger, and (v) the merger would not violate any applicable federal or state statutes,
rules or regulations.

Table of Contents

        JMP's opinion did not constitute legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax or other similar professional advice and did not address (i) the underlying decision of Forestar to proceed with or effect the
merger, (ii) the terms of the merger (other than the $14.25 per share consideration to the extent expressly addressed in JMP's opinion) or any arrangements, understandings, agreements or documents related to
the merger, (iii) the fairness of the merger (other than with respect to the $14.25 per share consideration to the extent expressly addressed in JMP's opinion) or any other transaction to Forestar's equity holders or
creditors or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the merger to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other
constituencies of Forestar or the fairness of the $14.25 per share consideration relative to any such consideration, (iv) the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative strategy or transaction that
might exist for Forestar, or the effect of any other transaction which Forestar may consider in the future, (v) the tax, accounting or legal consequences of the merger, or (vi) the solvency, creditworthiness, fair
market value or fair value of any of Forestar, Merger Parent or their respective assets under any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar matters. JMP's opinion
expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the $14.25 per
share consideration to be received by the holders of Forestar common stock in the merger.

        JMP's opinion was necessarily based on business, economic, monetary, market and other conditions as they existed and could be reasonably be evaluated on, and the information made available to JMP as
of, the date of JMP's opinion. Subsequent developments may affect JMP's opinion, and JMP assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the
date of the opinion (regardless of the closing date of the merger). JMP has not been engaged to amend, supplement or update its opinion at any time. JMP expressed no view or opinion as to the prices at which
Forestar common stock may be purchased, sold or exchanged, or otherwise be transferable, at any time. JMP also expressed no view or opinion as to the prices at which any of the real estate assets of Forestar
may be purchased, sold or exchanged, or otherwise be transferable, at any time. Forestar imposed no other instructions or limitations on JMP with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by
JMP in rendering its opinion.

        In preparing its opinion, JMP performed a variety of financial analyses, including those described below. This summary of the analyses is not a complete description of JMP's opinion or the analyses
underlying, and factors considered in connection with, JMP's opinion, but summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in connection with such opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a
complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and,
therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. JMP arrived at its ultimate opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole, and did not draw,
in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis for purposes of its opinion. Accordingly, JMP believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and selecting portions
of its analyses and factors without considering all analyses and factors could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion.

        In its analyses, JMP considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond the
control of Forestar. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical to Forestar or the merger. An evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, the analyses involve complex
considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions reviewed.

        The estimates contained in JMP's analyses and the valuation ranges resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may
be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by its analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, JMP's analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

        JMP was not requested to, and it did not, recommend the specific consideration payable in the merger. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations
between Forestar and Merger Parent and the decision of Forestar to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of Forestar's board of directors. JMP's opinion was only one of many factors considered by
Forestar's board of directors in its consideration of the merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of Forestar's board of directors or management with respect to the merger or the
consideration to be received in the merger.

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses provided to Forestar's board of directors in connection with JMP's opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information
presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand JMP's financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. Considering the data below without considering
the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of JMP's financial
analyses.

        Net Asset Valuation Analysis.    JMP performed a net asset valuation analysis of Forestar based on (i) financial projections provided to JMP by Forestar relating to Forestar's community development
projects as well as the estimated sale value of Forestar's multifamily assets (as summarized in "—Projected Financial Information"), (ii) certain purchase price information from letters of intent and draft
purchase agreements provided to JMP by Forestar relating to certain other real estate assets of Forestar held for sale, including mineral, water and timberland assets and other undeveloped land assets held for
sale, and (iii) book values as of December 31, 2016 for Forestar's other assets and liabilities provided to JMP by Forestar. With respect to Forestar's community development projects, JMP calculated a range of
implied present values of approximately $271.635 million to $299.069 million for the projected cash flows that Forestar's community development projects were forecasted by Forestar to generate using a
blended discount rate of 23.0% to 27.0%, which reflected project-by-project adjustments based on project type, project lifecycle, project activity status and other market specific adjustments (weighted by the
projected cash flows of each community development project) to an initial discount rate range of 19.5% to 23.5% selected by JMP based on review of industry surveys, industry research and industry
experience. With respect to Forestar's multifamily assets, JMP calculated a range of implied present values of approximately $43.697 million to $54.686 million for the potential estimated net proceeds that
Forestar forecasted could be generated by Forestar from the sale of such assets. Other real estate asset values were based on certain third party appraisals and other purchase price information provided to JMP
by Forestar. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Forestar, as compared to the $14.25 per share consideration to be received in the merger.

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    JMP performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Forestar based on financial projections provided to JMP by Forestar relating to Forestar (as summarized in "—
Projected Financial Information"). Using discount rates ranging from 13.1% to 16.1% which were selected by JMP taking into account a weighted average cost of capital calculation. JMP calculated (i) a

range of implied present values of the projected unlevered free cash flows of Forestar that Forestar was forecasted to generate from calendar year 2017 through calendar year 2026 as summarized in "—
Projected Financial Information" and (ii) a range of implied present values of implied terminal values for Forestar derived by applying a range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.5% to 0.5% selected by JMP to
Forestar's estimated unlevered free cash flows for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2026. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Forestar,
as compared to the $14.25 per share consideration to be received in the merger:

        Premiums Paid in Selected Historical M&A Transactions.    JMP reviewed for informational purposes (and not as part of JMP's financial analysis with respect to its opinion) the implied premiums paid in
27 selected acquisitions of publicly traded U.S. equity REITs and homebuilders relative to the closing stock prices of the acquired companies one day, five days and 30 days prior to public announcement of the
relevant transaction and relative to the volume weighted average stock prices of the acquired companies during the 30-day, 60-day, 90-day and 180-day periods (except as otherwise noted) ended on the last
trading day prior to public announcement of the relevant transaction. The selected acquisitions consisted of completed transactions consummated between January 1, 2007 and April 12, 2017 with at least 50%
cash consideration and announced equity transaction values of between $250 million and $5 billion. The medians of the implied premiums paid in the selected acquisitions reviewed by JMP were then compared
to the implied premiums paid in the merger based on the $14.25 per share consideration to be received in the merger relative to the closing stock prices of Forestar on April 12, 2017, April 7, 2017 and
March 12, 2017 and relative to the volume weighted average stock prices of Forestar during the 30-day, 60-day, 90-day and 180-day periods ended April 12, 2017, as follows:

        JMP also reviewed with Forestar's board of directors for informational purposes (and not as part of JMP's financial analysis with respect to its opinion), among other things, the implied premiums paid in
the merger based on the $14.25 per share consideration to be received in the merger relative to the closing stock prices of Forestar on August 18, 2016 (the date of JMP's formal engagement by Forestar with
respect to the potential sale process) and on the dates 30, 60, 90 and 180 days prior to April 12, 2017, which implied premiums were 16.3%, 9.6%, 9.6%, 9.6% and 28.5%, respectively.

        Miscellaneous.    Under the terms of JMP's engagement, Forestar has agreed to pay JMP for its financial advisory services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee currently estimated to be
approximately $5.2 million, a portion of which became payable upon JMP's engagement, a portion of which was payable upon delivery of JMP's opinion and approximately $4.2 million of which is contingent
upon completion of the merger. In addition, Forestar has agreed to indemnify JMP against certain claims and liabilities related to or arising out of its engagement. JMP may seek to provide financial advisory
services to Forestar, Merger Parent, Starwood or their respective affiliates in the future, for which JMP would expect to receive compensation. In the ordinary course of business, JMP and its affiliates may
actively trade or hold the securities of Forestar for their own account or for the account of their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in those securities.

        Forestar selected JMP as its financial advisor in connection with the merger based on JMP's reputation and experience and familiarity with Forestar and its business. JMP is a nationally recognized
investment banking firm which provides capital raising, mergers and acquisitions transaction and other strategic advisory services to corporate clients. JMP's opinion was approved by a JMP Securities LLC
fairness opinion committee.

Projected Financial Information 

        Forestar does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose long-term projections as to future financial performance due to, among other reasons, the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and
estimates, though Forestar has in the past provided investors with annual lot sale volume guidance among other items, which it may update from time to time during the relevant year. However, in connection
with the evaluation of the proposed merger, Forestar provided its board of directors and/or certain bidders, including Starwood, with certain non-public, unaudited prospective financial information prepared by
Forestar's management, as summarized below, which we refer to as the "Forecasts." As noted below, certain Forecasts were also provided to JMP for use in connection with its financial analyses summarized
under "—Opinion of Forestar's Financial Advisor".

        The Forecasts were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement only because such information was made available as described above. The Forecasts were not
prepared with a view to compliance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States, which we refer to as GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and
forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither the Company's
independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they
expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information. The
Forecasts included in this proxy statement have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Forestar's management, and are subjective in many respects.

        Although a summary of the Forecasts is presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by Forestar's management, which it believes were
reasonable at the time the Forecasts were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to management at such time. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as
being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Forecasts not to be achieved include general economic conditions, interest rates, accuracy of
certain accounting assumptions, timing of development expenditures, demand for residential lots and new housing, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures, including from existing and
potential new real estate supply, and changes in tax or other laws, governmental policies or regulations. In addition, the Forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring

after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Forecasts will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those
contained in the Forecasts. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the Forestar board of directors, Forestar's management, Starwood, JMP, their respective representatives
or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the Forecasts to be material information of Forestar, or necessarily predictive of actual future results nor should it be construed as
financial guidance, and it should not be relied upon as such. The summary of the Forecasts is not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or to influence any stockholder to make any investment decision with respect to the merger or Forestar, including whether or
not to seek appraisal rights with respect to the shares of Forestar's common stock.

        The Forecasts should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information regarding Forestar contained in Forestar's public filings with the SEC. The Forecasts
are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause Forestar's future results to materially vary, see "Forward Looking Statements" beginning on page 20.

        Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any responsibility to update or otherwise revise the Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing
after the date when Forestar prepared the Forecasts or to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general economic of industry conditions, even in the event that any of the assumptions underlying
the Forecasts are shown to be in error.

        In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Forecasts, stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Forecasts included in this proxy statement.

        Certain of the measures included in the Forecasts may be considered non-GAAP financial measures, as noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a
substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Forestar may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies.

Community Development Project Cash Flows

        The following table presents the estimated future net cash flow data prepared by Forestar's management for the Company's community development business from January 1, 2017—October 31, 2034. This
data does not include any cash flows generated from non-core asset sales or any other sources other than the community development business. The net cash flows include direct project related carry costs, but
excludes SG&A costs not directly associated with the projects, interest expense on corporate debt and income taxes. It does not give effect to the merger and related transactions.

        The Company has historically prepared this data for internal business purposes and updated the information quarterly to reflect business activity in the prior quarter. The Company made the data available
to JMP in connection with its analyses and to all parties in the potential sale process that

Alternative Net Asset Value Scenarios

        The following table represents net asset value scenarios that were prepared by Forestar's management and presented to the Forestar board of directors in February 2017 as the board of directors considered
the various strategic alternatives for Forestar, including the potential bulk sale of the community development assets, sale of the remaining non-core assets and subsequent liquidation of the Company. As noted
above, the Company made a number of assumptions and estimates in preparation of the prospective financial information, including assumptions regarding the sales prices of non-core assets and SG&A costs.
The potential scenarios depicted in the table below were (a) a bulk sale of community development assets in September 2017 and the sale of the remaining non-core assets by year-end 2017, (b) a bulk sale of
the community development assets in December 2019 and the sale of the remaining non-core assets by year-end 2017, (c) a portfolio run-off based on the execution of Forestar's existing business plan with no
new acquisitions assumed and the sale of the remaining non-core assets by year-end 2017, (d) a plan to continue operating Forestar as a standalone public company executing the existing business plans with
additional investment in the business to maintain approximately 1,800 lots sold per year on average over the next five years and the sale of the remaining non-core assets by year-end 2017, and (e) a plan to
continue operating Forestar as a standalone public company executing the existing business plans with additional investment in the business to maintain approximately 2,500 lots sold per year on average over
the next five years and the sale of the remaining

2017 - 2026 Financial Model

        The following table presents selected unaudited prospective financial data for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2026 for Forestar as provided to JMP in April 2017 in
connection with its financial analyses summarized under "—Opinion of Forestar's Financial Advisor." This financial data generally incorporates and reflects the financial information included in "Community
Development Project Cash Flows" above, except for changes relating to updated timing assumptions with respect to three community development projects to reflect developments after the preparation of the
financial information included in "Community Development Project Cash Flows" above. The data does not give effect to the merger and related transactions. This financial data was not provided to Starwood or
other potential acquirors.

        For use in connection with its financial analyses summarized under "—Opinion of Forestar's Financial Advisor", JMP Securities arithmetically calculated projected unlevered free cash flow for
2017 - 2026 using the information contained in the prospective 2017-2026 financial model prepared by Forestar's management, as follows (in millions): 2017: $183.1; 2018: $76.8; 2019: $52.8; 2020: $73.2;
2021: ($3.9); 2022: $36.8; 2023: $28.1; 2024: $26.8; 2025: $2.4; 2026: $24.8. Unlevered free cash flow is defined for purposes of the Forecasts as net cash flow generated excluding debt repayment and interest
expense, interest income and tax benefit of interest tax deductible. Calculation also excludes consolidated venture cash flows due to third parties. Unlevered free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and
should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or net income as a measure of operating performance or net change in cash flow as a measure of liquidity. The foregoing estimates of unlevered free cash
flows were calculated solely for purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis in connection with JMP's opinion, and none of Forestar, Starwood or JMP assumes any responsibility for any use of such
estimates, or reliance on such estimates, for any other purpose.

(1) The model assumes Forestar would deploy capital to re-invest in its community development business to achieve the sale of approximately 1,700 - 1,800 lots per year from the
business, generally consistent with the average range of lots sold 2012 - 2016, including approximately $94 million invested in acquisitions and development (including
contributions to ventures) per year on average to fund the replacement of residential lot inventory sold from the community development business as projected. The model also
assumes the Company's senior secured notes of $5.3 million are paid in full in second quarter of 2017 and the Company's convertible notes are held and paid in full at maturity in the
first quarter of 2020. The model assumes all growth is funded through cash flow generated from operations and assumes no additional leverage on the business. The model assumes
income tax liability of $35.1 million net of refunds in 2017 related to gains from non-core asset sales and from operations of the community development business. Income taxes are
calculated in 2018 - 2026 based on a 37% income tax rate with limited ability to utilize any built in losses from the community development business due the continued operations
and capitalization of costs for tax purposes. The model assumes Forestar continues operating over the 10 year period as a standalone public company and the Company executes its
cost savings related to targeted SG&A levels.

Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the Company's board that you vote to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that the Company's directors and current and former executive officers have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of the Company's stockholders generally. The Company's board was aware of and considered those interests, among other matters, in
reaching its decisions to (i) approve the merger and (ii) resolve to recommend that the Company's stockholders adopt the merger agreement. Stockholders should take these interests into account in deciding
whether to vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the narrative below and, for the executive officers, in
the Golden Parachute Compensation table in the "—Merger-Related Compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers" section below.

Overview

        Certain directors hold unvested stock options that will vest and become payable upon consummation of the merger. The non-employee directors otherwise have no interests in the merger that are different
from, or in addition to, those of the Company's stockholders generally, though the directors do also hold fully vested restricted stock units and, together with the executive officers of Forestar, will be entitled to
receive indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from the surviving entity and coverage under directors' and officers' liability insurance policies following the merger. See "The Merger
Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance" below.

        Each of the Company's current executive officers (Messrs. Phillip J. Weber, Charles D. Jehl and Michael Quinley) hold unvested equity awards that will vest and become payable upon consummation of the
merger, and each will be entitled to certain severance benefits upon and by reason of a qualifying termination of employment following the merger. Mr. David M. Grimm, the Company's former Chief
Administrative Officer & General Counsel, holds unvested equity awards that will vest and become payable upon and by reason of consummation of the merger, and he is also party to a Separation Agreement
and Release that will provide him additional benefits by reason of consummation of the merger. Mr. Bruce F. Dickson, the Company's former Chief Real Estate Officer (together with Messrs. Weber, Jehl,
Quinley and Grimm, the "named executive officers") holds performance-based equity awards that will become payable upon consummation of the merger, but he is not entitled to any other compensation or
benefits by reason of the merger.

        Following execution of the merger agreement, Starwood has engaged in discussions with certain employees of the Company regarding the terms of the potential employment of such employees after the
closing with an entity affiliated with an investor in Merger Parent, which entity will provide certain services to the surviving entity.

        These interests are described further below.

Equity Award Acceleration

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, each Company equity incentive compensation award that is outstanding immediately prior to the merger will be cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the
effective time of the merger and, in exchange for the cancellation of such equity award, whether or not such equity incentive compensation award was vested as of the effective time of the merger, the holder
will receive the merger consideration for each underlying share of Company common stock (in the case of stock options, less the aggregate exercise price, but not less than $0). With respect to market-leveraged
stock units, whose underlying share number generally depends on the Company's stock price at the end of the applicable performance period, the number of underlying shares will be based on the merger
consideration.

        Several of our directors hold unvested equity awards in the form of stock options (in addition to restricted stock units that will either vest by reason of service before consummation of the merger or

cease to be of effect at the time of the merger). The number of options (based on holdings as of May 19, 2017) and their value (based on the excess of the merger consideration over the applicable exercise price)
are set out in the table below as applicable.

        In addition, each named executive officer holds market-leveraged stock units, and each of our named executive officers other than Mr. Dickson hold unvested stock options and time-based restricted stock
units. The value of those various awards is reflected in the Golden Parachute Compensation table in the "—Merger-Related Compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers" section below.

Change in Control/Severance Agreements with Current Executive Officers

        Each of our current executive officers is a party to a Change in Control/Severance Agreement with the Company that provides certain payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination of the executive
officer's employment by the Company without "cause" (as defined below) or by the executive for "good reason" (as defined below) within two years following a "change in control" of the Company (which
would include consummation of the merger). Upon such a qualifying termination of employment, the executives would be entitled to:

• a prorated current cycle annual incentive bonus if the termination is before the end of the first half of the cycle or a full annual incentive bonus if termination is during the second half of the cycle
(in each case, assuming achievement of performance goals at the target level); 

• any earned but unpaid incentive compensation that has been allocated or awarded to the executive for a completed bonus cycle preceding the date of termination (presently $0); 

• lump sum cash severance payment equal to two times their highest base salary during the three-year period prior to the change in control plus two times the target annual bonus during the year of
the termination, or if higher, the actual bonus in any of the three fiscal years preceding the termination; 

• health and welfare benefits for two years at no greater cost to the executive; 

• full acceleration of vesting of all unvested or restricted equity or equity-based awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, market-leveraged
stock units, and performance stock units (though, in regard to awards outstanding immediately before consummation of the merger, such acceleration will occur by reason of the consummation of
the merger without regard to any subsequent employment termination); 

• a lump sum payment equal to two years' match and contributions under the Company's 401(k) plan plus two years' contributions under the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
("SERP"), assuming, in each case, that the executive made the maximum permissible contributions and earned compensation at the highest rate of compensation during the three-year period prior
to the termination; 

• three years (two years in the case of Mr. Jehl) of additional service credit under the SERP (though no such additional service credit will increase the executives' benefit under that plan);

• reimbursement for outplacement services for one year not to exceed 15% of the sum of the applicable executive's highest base salary during the three years preceding the termination and his
target bonus for the year of the termination, or if higher, the actual bonus in any of the three fiscal years before the termination; and 

• two years' continuation of current perquisites.

        The agreements with Messrs. Jehl and Quinley include gross-up provisions in the event the executive is required to pay excise tax on these amounts, but only if their value exceeds 110% of the amount that
would not be subject to excise tax; otherwise the amount would be reduced to the maximum amount that would not trigger the excise tax. Mr. Weber is not entitled to any excise tax gross-up; however, if any
amounts payable to him would be subject to excise tax, the amount payable to him would be reduced to the extent such reduction would provide him with a greater after-tax benefit.

        For purposes of the Change in Control/Severance Agreement, "cause" generally means (i) the willful and continued failure by the executive officer to substantially perform his or her duties with the
Company after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered by the board of directors of the Company or (ii) the willful engaging by the executive officer in conduct which is demonstrably and
materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise.

        For purposes of the Change in Control/Severance Agreement, "good reason" generally means (i) a material reduction in the executive officer's authority, duties, or responsibilities, which for purposes of the
Change in Control/Severance Agreement, shall include only the assignment to the executive officer of any duties substantially inconsistent with the executive officer's status as a senior executive officer of the
Company or a material adverse alteration in the nature or status of the executive officer's responsibilities from those in effect immediately prior to the change in control (including, as applicable and without
limitation, the executive officer ceasing to be an executive officer of a public company), (ii) a material diminution in base salary as in effect immediately prior to the change in control, (iii) relocation of the
executive officer's principal place of employment to a location more than fifty miles from the Company's headquarters immediately prior to the change in control or (iv) any other action of inaction that
constitutes a material breach of certain successor employer obligations or employee benefits continuation provisions of the Change in Control/ Severance Agreement. Any such "good reason" must be asserted
by the executive officer in a notice of termination given within ninety days following the date of the first act or failure to act constituting such "good reason."

        The Golden Parachute Compensation table in the "—Merger-Related Compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers" section below quantifies the payments and benefits that may be provided
under the Change in Control/Severance Agreements upon a qualifying termination of employment following consummation of the merger. In addition, pursuant to the terms of a separate employment agreement
with the Company, upon a termination of employment for any reason before October 21, 2017, Mr. Weber would be subject to a two-year noncompetition and employee/customer nonsolicitation restrictive
covenant.

Separation and Release Agreement with Mr. Grimm

        On April 13, 2017, the Company and Mr. Grimm entered into a Separation Agreement and Release pursuant to which Mr. Grimm's employment with the Company terminated effective April 14, 2017.
Pursuant to that agreement, Mr. Grimm provided a release of claims against the Company, agreed to certain other restrictive covenants and cooperation undertakings, and also agreed to provide consulting
services to the Company on an as-needed basis during the 90-day period following his departure (or if earlier, through consummation of the merger) in consideration for a monthly consulting fee of $25,000,
pro-rated if applicable for any partial month of service.

        Upon and by reason of his employment termination, the Company agreed to provide Mr. Grimm termination benefits in the form of a lump-sum cash payment of $550,000, reimbursement for medical
continuation costs for one year and for the cost of converting his Company-provided life and AD&D

insurance to a personal policy (provided that such reimbursement obligations will cease to the extent he acquires other employer-provided coverage), and reimbursement for outplacement expenses of up to
$25,000 to the extent incurred not more than six months following his termination.

        Upon consummation of the merger, the Company will provide to Mr. Grimm the payments and benefits that would have been provided to him (based on his compensation levels in effect upon his
employment termination) pursuant to the Change in Control/Severance Agreement that was in effect between him and the Company immediately before his termination as if he had experienced a qualifying
termination of employment thereunder immediately following consummation of the merger, less the termination benefits provided to him under the Separation Agreement and Release. Mr. Grimm's Change in
Control/Severance Agreement was substantially identical to the Change in Control Severance Agreement applicable to Mr. Jehl, as described above under "—Change in Control/Severance Agreements with
Current Executive Officers." The amounts that would become payable to Mr. Grimm under his Separation Agreement and Release by reason of the consummation of the merger are set out in the Golden
Parachute Compensation table in the "—Merger-Related Compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers" section below.

Potential Continued Employment of Mr. Jehl

        Mr. Jehl has agreed in principle to certain proposed terms of employment, commencing effective upon consummation of the merger, with LSM Administrative Services, LLC ("LSM"), an affiliate of an
investor in Merger Parent, as LSM's Texas Region President. There is no assurance that such employment will occur, nor has a definitive employment agreement been agreed to at this time. Mr. Jehl and LSM
have agreed in principle that a definitive employment agreement, if any, would provide for, among other terms and conditions: an annual base salary of $295,000, an annual bonus potential of $195,000
beginning in 2018, and a bonus of $75,000 in respect of 2017 if Mr. Jehl remains employed by LSM on December 31, 2017. The parties have agreed that Mr. Jehl's employment by LSM would be contingent
upon his investing at least $500,000 in LSM, which shall be an investor in the merger. The final terms and conditions of any such investment have not yet been documented or agreed; Mr. Jehl would be
afforded the opportunity to review definitive documentation of such investment before accepting employment with LSM and making the investment. Finally, it is presently expected that, if Mr. Jehl commences
employment with LSM, LSM or an affiliate of Starwood would pay him upon consummation of the merger a cash lump-sum amount of $2,584,454 (the "Cash Lump Sum Payment"). If such Cash Lump Sum
Payment is paid to Mr. Jehl by LSM or an affiliate of Starwood, the amount payable to Mr. Jehl under his Change in Control/Severance Agreement would be correspondingly reduced by such Cash Lump Sum
Payment. It is expected that the Company will reimburse Mr. Jehl for legal fees he incurs in negotiating his potential employment with LSM.

Indemnification and Insurance

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, members of the Forestar board of directors and executive officers of Forestar will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors'
and officers' liability insurance policies following the merger. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance."

Merger-Related Compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers

        In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the Golden Parachute Compensation table below sets forth the estimated amount of compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger
and that may be payable to the Company's "named executive officers" identified above, who are those individuals listed in the "Summary Compensation Table" that is part of the Company's most recent
securities filing for which disclosure was required under Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K (its proxy statement for the 2017 annual meeting). These amounts have been calculated assuming the merger was

consummated on May 19, 2017 (the record date), equity incentive compensation award holdings as of such date and, for purposes of determining equity award values, the per-share merger consideration (a per-
share cash value of $14.25). The amounts in the table below do not include amounts that are already vested without regard to the merger (such as vested equity awards and benefits under the Company's
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan) or amounts that may be granted following the date of this proxy statement.

        Other than the amounts shown in the "Equity" column of the table and the amounts shown for Mr. Grimm, which amounts will become payable upon and solely by reason of consummation of the merger,
the amounts set out in the table below are payable only if there shall occur a qualifying termination of employment within two years following consummation of the merger (a termination of Messrs. Weber, Jehl

consummation.

experienced a qualifying termination of employment thereunder immediately following consummation of the merger, less the $550,000 already paid to him upon his termination of
employment and less certain medical cost amounts described in footnote 2 to this table.

Mr. Grimm, less the $550,000 already paid under his Separation and Release Agreement): (i) two times their respective highest base salary during the three-year period prior to the

Parachute Compensation" table above (and in the "Pro-Rated Bonus" column in the table immediately above) would be increased as follows by reason of additional amounts payable
in respect of the 2017 annual bonus cycle: $312,500 for Mr. Weber, $162,500 for Mr. Jehl, $103,125 for Mr. Quinley and $103,125 for Mr. Grimm.

Each of the awards will vest on a "single-trigger" basis upon and by reason of the consummation of the merger, whether or not employment is terminated. Depending on when the
merger is consummated, certain stock options held by Mr. Weber may vest pursuant to their terms before the merger closing date; no such option has an exercise price of less than
$14.25, however, and accordingly no such option is reflected in the "Golden Parachute Table" in any event.

Financing 

        Merger Parent and Merger Sub have represented to the Company that Parent will have sufficient funds at the closing of the merger, taken together with our cash on hand, to pay all cash amounts required to
be paid by Merger Parent and Merger Sub under the merger agreement.

        Merger Parent anticipates that the funds needed to close the merger will be funded through a combination of equity financing from SOF-X U.S. Holdings, L.P., an affiliate of Starwood, which we refer to as
"SOF-X U.S. Holdings," in an amount up to $476.48 million and our cash on hand.

        The consummation of the merger is not subject to any financing conditions, although funding of the equity financing is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the commitment letter under
which the equity financing will be provided.

Equity Financing

        Merger Parent has entered into an equity commitment letter with SOF-X U.S. Holdings, dated April 13, 2017, pursuant to which SOF-X U.S. Holdings has committed to contribute to Merger Parent, at or
prior to the closing of the merger, up to $476.48 million.

        The obligation of SOF-X U.S. Holdings to fund the equity financing contemplated by the equity commitment letter is subject to (i) the satisfaction or waiver in writing by Merger Parent and Merger Sub of
all conditions to the obligations of Merger Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (ii) the contemporaneous consummation of the closing of the
merger.

        The obligation of SOF-X U.S. Holdings to fund the equity financing commitment generally will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the valid termination of the merger agreement in accordance with
its terms; (b) the closing of the merger; (c) the funding of the equity financing commitment by SOF-X U.S. Holdings or its assigns; and (d) the Company or any of its equityholders, affiliates or subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, asserting any claim against SOF-X U.S. Holdings or any related party other than a claim against any related party under the merger agreement or against SOF-X U.S. Holdings under the
limited guarantee.

Limited Guarantee and Remedies

        In connection with the merger agreement, SOF-X US Holdings has agreed to, subject to the terms and conditions of a limited guarantee, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee to Forestar
the payment of certain amounts required under the merger agreement by Merger Parent including with respect to: (i) the payment of the $40 million Parent termination fee in accordance with the terms of the
merger agreement; and (ii) certain indemnification and reimbursement obligations in accordance with the merger agreement, in each case, as, when and to the extent due under the merger agreement. The limited
guarantee will terminate on the earlier of (a) the closing of the merger, (b) the payment in full of the guaranteed obligations (as specified in the limited guarantee) and (c) 120 days following a termination of the
merger agreement in accordance with its terms (except as to payments for which a claim has been made prior to such termination).

(3) Represents the value of: (i) for Messrs. Weber, Jehl and Quinley, two years of continued medical/welfare benefits ($33,070, $33,002 and $33,002, respectively) and, for Mr. Grimm,
two years of continued medical/welfare benefits less the medical continuation coverage amount already provided to him in respect of the period beginning May 1, 2017 and ending
upon consummation of the merger ($23,894); and (ii) one year of outplacement assistance ($150,000 for Mr. Weber, $101,250 for Mr. Jehl, $80,250 for Mr. Quinley and, assuming
that he will not have incurred any other outplacement expense before consummation of the merger, $84,750 for Mr. Grimm); and (iii) the value of two years of continued perquisites
($1,853). Continued medical coverage amounts reflect actual Company costs for 2017 and assume an annual 15% cost increase. These benefits and payments are "double-trigger" in
nature as they will be provided only in the event of a termination of employment by the Company without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason" within two years following
consummation of the merger, except in the case of Mr. Grimm, who becomes eligible for them upon and by reason of the consummation of the merger—i.e., on a "single-trigger"
basis.

        We cannot seek specific performance to require Merger Parent and Merger Sub to perform their respective obligations under the merger agreement, including to complete the merger, and our
exclusive remedy for the failure of Merger Parent and Merger Sub to complete the merger is to seek payment of the $40 million Parent termination fee and certain indemnification and
reimbursement obligations, as supported by the limited guarantee described above. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination—Termination Fees—Merger Parent Termination Fee."

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following discussion is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of shares of Forestar common stock that are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to
the merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and other applicable
authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change or differing interpretation could
affect the accuracy of the conclusions set forth herein. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of Forestar common stock as "capital assets" within the meaning of the Code (generally,
property held for investment purposes). This summary does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign tax jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S.
federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g., state, gift or alternative minimum tax or the Medicare net investment income surtax). In addition, this summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax
consequences to holders of shares who exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law. For purposes of this discussion, a "holder" is a U.S. Holder, a Non-U.S. Holder or both, as the context may require.

        This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances, including:

• holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, S corporations or any other entities or arrangements
treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein), insurance companies, mutual funds, dealers in stocks and securities, traders in
securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, certain expatriates or former long-term
residents of the United States or holders subject to the alternative minimum tax; 

• holders holding shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reducing transaction; 

• holders who received their shares of Forestar common stock in a compensatory transaction; and 

• U.S. Holders whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar.

        If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of Forestar common stock, the tax treatment of a person
treated as a partner in such partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding the shares of Forestar
common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the merger.

        We have not sought, and do not intend to seek, any ruling from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary. No assurance can be given that the IRS
will agree with the views expressed in this summary or that a court will not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

Table of Contents

U.S. Holders

        For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of shares of Forestar common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• a corporation (or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia; 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

• a trust (i) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of such trust or (ii) that has made a valid election under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

        The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of Forestar common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S.
Holders will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S.
Holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of Forestar common stock will generally equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder's holding period in such shares exceeds one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain will generally apply to long-term
capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder. There are limitations on the deductibility of capital losses. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of shares at different times and different prices, such U.S.
Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each block of shares.

Non-U.S. Holders

        For purposes of this discussion, a "Non-U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of shares of Forestar common stock that is not a U.S. Holder or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-
through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        Any gain recognized by a Non-U.S. Holder as a result of the merger will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• such gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates applicable to U.S. Holders, and if
such Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty); 

• such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such
gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty) and may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses (provided such Non-U.S.
Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses); or 

• we are or have been a U.S. real property holding corporation ("USRPHC") at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger and such Non-U.S. Holder's holding

period (the "Relevant Period") with respect to such holder's shares of Forestar common stock. We believe that we are currently a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, as long
as our common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States, within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations, a Non-U.S. Holder will not
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized as a result of the merger if such Non-U.S. Holder has not held (actually or constructively) more than 5% of our outstanding common
stock at any time within the Relevant Period. If a Non-U.S. Holder has held (actually or constructively) more than 5% of our outstanding common stock at any time within the Relevant Period,
any gain recognized as a result of the merger will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates applicable to U.S. Holders.

        HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION.

Regulatory Matters 

Required Approvals

        We are not aware of any material U.S. federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals that are required for the execution of the merger agreement or the completion of the merger, other than
the filing of a Certificate of Merger with respect to the merger with, and the acceptance of such Certificate of Merger for record by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

Commitments to Obtain Approvals

        Forestar and Merger Parent have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws to consummate the merger as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain any requisite approvals, consents, authorizations, orders, exemptions or waivers by any governmental
entity or other third party (provided that in respect of contracts with third parties, neither Forestar nor Merger Parent will be required to make or agree to make any payment or accept any material conditions) in
connection with the merger and to fulfill the conditions to the merger. However, under no circumstances is Merger Parent or Merger Sub obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to
enter into any consent decrees, to make any divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other action that, in the reasonable judgment of Merger Parent, could be expected to limit the right of
Merger Parent or its subsidiaries to own or operate all or any portion of their respective businesses or assets, including those of the Company.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger 

        Unless another date is agreed by Forestar and Merger Parent, the closing of the merger will take place on the third business day following the satisfaction or waiver in accordance with the merger agreement
of all of the conditions to closing (as described under "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger"), other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, in no event will the closing occur prior to July 1, 2017. Concurrently with the closing, the parties will file a
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the "DRULPA"). The merger will become
effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger, or at such later time as is agreed by the parties and specified in the certificate of merger.

Delisting and Deregistration of Forestar Common Stock 

        If the merger is completed, Forestar common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        Below is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.
This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the merger agreement in its
entirety, as the rights and obligations of the parties thereto are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement 

        The following summary of the merger agreement, and the copy of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this proxy statement, are intended to provide information regarding the terms of the merger
agreement and are not intended to provide any factual information about Forestar or modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Forestar in its public reports filed with the SEC. Any material facts in
Forestar's public reports previously filed with the SEC that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement that contradict the factual disclosures about Forestar contained in the representations and
warranties in the merger agreement shall modify such factual disclosures. In particular, the merger agreement and the related summary are not intended to be disclosures regarding any facts and circumstances
relating to Forestar. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by, and covenants of, Forestar, Merger Parent and Merger Sub that were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and
as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by
the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the merger agreement instead of establishing these matters
as facts, and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that generally differ from those applicable to investors. In addition, information concerning the subject
matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Forestar's public disclosures.
Investors are not third party beneficiaries under the merger agreement.

        Additional information about Forestar may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and Forestar's other public filings. See "Where You Can Find Additional Information."

Structure of the Merger; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers 

        At the effective time of the merger, Forestar will merge with and into Merger Sub and the separate corporate existence of Forestar will cease. Merger Sub will be the surviving entity (sometimes referred to
herein as the "surviving entity") in the merger and will continue its corporate existence as a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Parent. At the effective time of the merger, all of the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Forestar and Merger Sub shall vest in the surviving entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Forestar and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the surviving
entity, all as provided under the DGCL and the DRULPA. The limited partnership agreement of Merger Sub that is in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will become the limited
partnership agreement of the surviving entity until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and the DRULPA, except for changes to reflect any changes to the name of the surviving entity or, if
necessary, to reflect the indemnification provisions in the current certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Forestar.

        Subject to applicable law, the general partner of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time shall be the general partner of the surviving entity immediately following the effective time. The officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time shall be the initial officers of the

surviving entity until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly designated.

When the Merger Becomes Effective 

        The closing of the merger will take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, 1440 New York Avenue NW, Washington, District of Columbia 20005 on the third business day after
the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions at the closing), unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Forestar and Merger Parent.

        On the closing date of the merger, the parties will cause a certificate of merger to be duly executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL and the
DRULPA. The merger shall become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or on such later date and time as shall be agreed to by the
parties and specified in the certificate of merger.

Effect of the Merger on Forestar Common Stock 

        As of the effective time of the merger, each share of Forestar common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares owned or held in treasury by Forestar or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Forestar and shares owned by Merger Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Parent (including Merger Sub) and other than shares with
respect to which a Forestar stockholder has properly exercised its appraisal rights) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $14.25 in cash, without interest, and subject to any
applicable withholding taxes.

        As of the effective time of the merger, each share held by Merger Parent, Merger Sub, Forestar (including shares held in treasury by Forestar) or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger shall be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be delivered with respect thereto.

        As of the effective time of the merger, all of the partnership interests of Merger Sub that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall remain outstanding and unchanged by virtue of the
merger as outstanding partnership interests of the surviving entity, and such partnership interests shall continue to be owned by Merger Parent.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards 

        The merger agreement provides that each equity incentive compensation award denominated in shares of Forestar common stock (an "Equity Award") that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger will be cancelled as of the effective time. In exchange for such cancellation, the holders of Equity Awards will receive the merger consideration for each share of common stock underlying the
Equity Award (plus payment in cash of all accrued dividend equivalents, if any, with respect thereto and, in the case of equity awards that are stock options or stock appreciation rights, less the aggregate
exercise or strike price thereunder, but not less than $0), whether or not such Equity Award was vested as of the effective time of the merger, with such payment subject to applicable tax withholding.

        With respect to Equity Awards that vest upon the achievement of performance-based metrics, the number of shares of Forestar common stock subject to such Equity Awards will be determined according to
the terms set forth in the applicable award agreements. The only such performance-based Equity Awards presently outstanding are market-leveraged stock units, whose underlying share number

generally depends on the Company's stock price at the end of the applicable performance period, which by reason of the merger will be deemed to be the merger consideration.

Exchange of Shares and Certificates 

        Prior to the effective time of the merger, Merger Parent will engage a paying agent reasonably satisfactory to Forestar. Prior to the effective time of the merger, Merger Parent will deposit with the paying
agent cash equal to the aggregate merger consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Forestar common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Promptly after the effective time of the merger, Merger
Parent will cause the paying agent to transmit to each record holder of shares of Forestar common stock that were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, a letter of transmittal and
instructions for use in such payment.

        Upon surrender of a certificate or book-entry share, as applicable, to the paying agent together with the letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, the holder of such certificate or book-entry
share will be entitled to receive the merger consideration (less any amount that may be withheld with respect to any applicable withholding taxes) for each share of Forestar common stock formerly represented
by the certificate or book-entry share. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such certificate.

Representations and Warranties 

        The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of Forestar, Merger Parent and Merger Sub.

        Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by materiality qualifications or a "Company material adverse effect" qualification with respect to Forestar or a "Parent
material adverse effect" qualification with respect to Merger Parent. For purposes of the merger agreement, a "Company material adverse effect" with respect to Forestar means any change, effect, event,
occurrence, circumstance, condition, development or combination of the foregoing that, individually or in the aggregate, (i) results in any change that is materially adverse to the business of Forestar and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) has or would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the merger, provided, however, that, in the case of clause (i), "Company material adverse
effect" shall not be deemed to include the impact of:

• changes in general economic, business, labor or regulatory conditions, or changes in securities, credit or other financial markets; 

• changes generally affecting the real estate industry in the United States; 

• changes or proposed changes in any applicable law or changes in GAAP or its interpretation; 

• changes in political conditions (including the outbreak or escalation of war, military action, sabotage or acts of terrorism) or changes due to natural disasters, in each case, occurring after the date
of the merger agreement; 

• the effects of the actions or omissions specifically required of Forestar in connection with the merger agreement; 

• the effects of any material breach, violation or non-performance of any provision of the merger agreement by Merger Parent or Merger Sub; 

• the negotiation, execution, announcement or pendency of the merger agreement, or the consummation of the merger, including the identity of Merger Parent or any of its affiliates, or any
communication by Merger Parent or any of its affiliates regarding plans with respect to Forestar, its subsidiaries or their employees;

• changes in the trading price or volume of shares of Forestar common stock or change in the credit rating of Forestar or its subsidiaries; or

adverse effect has occurred to the extent not otherwise excluded by another exception.

        However, with respect to the matters described in the first, second, third and fourth bullet points above, any such effect shall be taken into account if and only to the extent it, individually or in the aggregate
with any other effect, disproportionately affects Forestar and its subsidiaries compared to other companies operating in the real estate industry in the United States.

        For the purpose of the merger agreement, a "material adverse effect" with respect to Merger Parent, which we refer to as a "Parent material adverse effect" means any change, effect, event, occurrence, state
of facts or development which individually or in the aggregate prevents or materially impairs or delays the consummation by Merger Parent or Merger Sub of the merger.

        Subject to certain exceptions in the merger agreement, in the disclosure letter delivered by Forestar to Merger Parent in connection with the merger agreement (referred to as the "Company disclosure
letter") and in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by Forestar and publicly available in the two years prior to the date of the merger agreement, the merger agreement contains representations and
warranties of Forestar as to, among other things:

proposal, (ii) cease providing information with respect to Forestar, its subsidiaries or any acquisition proposal, (iii) terminate access to physical or electronic data rooms for such persons, (iv) request that
persons in possession of confidential information about Forestar, furnished by Forestar in connection with previous discussions, to destroy such information, and (v) not, directly or indirectly:

• participate in discussions with, furnish any information to, or afford access to the business of the Company to, any third persons in connection with an acquisition proposal; 

• grant any waiver or release under or fail to enforce any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of Forestar or any of its subsidiaries, unless the Forestar board
of directors decides that the failure to grant such waiver or release would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; 

• approve any third person becoming an "interested stockholder" under Section 203 of the DGCL; 

• enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent or other agreement relating to an acquisition proposal; or 

• propose publicly to do any of the foregoing.

        Under the merger agreement, an "acquisition proposal" means any proposal by any third person, (i) to acquire, directly or indirectly, Forestar common stock (or securities exercisable, convertible,
redeemable or exchangeable for common stock) that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such third person beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, more than 15% of the combined
voting power of Forestar common stock outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such transaction, (ii) to acquire (including by joint venture), directly or indirectly, more than 15% of the
consolidated tangible assets of Forestar and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured by fair market value), (iii) to effect any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination or other similar
transaction involving Forestar pursuant to which any third person would hold, directly or indirectly, more than 15% of the combined voting power of the shares of outstanding Forestar common stock or of the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or (iv) to effect any combination of the foregoing.

Receipt of an Acquisition Proposal

        Prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, Forestar and its subsidiaries may participate in discussions regarding, and furnish information in response to, an unsolicited, bona fide written
acquisition proposal made after the date of the merger agreement and not resulting from any breach of the no solicitation section of the merger agreement, provided that: (i) the board of directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal, (ii) the board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable
law, (iii) Forestar receives an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms not less favorable to the Company than the terms of the confidentiality agreement between the Company and Starwood, and
(iv) promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) after furnishing any non-public information concerning Forestar or its subsidiaries, Forestar furnishes such information to Merger Parent, if such information
had not been previously furnished.

        Under the merger agreement, a "superior proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written acquisition proposal (substituting the term "50%" for the term "15%" in each instance where such term appears in
that definition) by any third person, that the board of directors determines in good faith would be reasonably likely to be consummated if accepted, and more favorable to Forestar stockholders from a financial
point of view than the merger (including any adjustments to the terms hereof that Merger Parent might offer pursuant to the no solicitation section of the merger agreement), after taking into account all
circumstances that the board of directors determines are relevant, including the legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such acquisition proposal, the identity of the person making the acquisition proposal, and
the anticipated timing, conditions and ability of the person making such acquisition proposal to consummate the transactions contemplated by such acquisition proposal (based upon, among other things,
expectation of obtaining required approvals or any necessary financing).

Table of Contents

Notice of Acquisition Proposal

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, Forestar must notify Merger Parent in writing promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) after receipt by Forestar or its representatives of any acquisition
proposal, any bona fide written indication that a third person intends to make an acquisition proposal or certain written requests for information, in each case by any third person that intends to make an
acquisition proposal. Forestar must identify the third person making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such acquisition proposal, indication or request. Forestar must keep Merger Parent reasonably
informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any such acquisition proposal, indication or request and shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to Merger Parent
copies of all written materials provided to Forestar or any of its subsidiaries that describe any terms of any acquisition proposal as well as written summaries of any material oral communications addressing
such matters.

The Company Recommendation; Change in Company Recommendation; Fiduciary Exception

        As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Forestar board of directors has made the recommendation that the Forestar stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, which recommendation we refer to as the "Company recommendation." The merger agreement provides that the board of directors will not effect a change in the Company recommendation except as
described below.

        Under the merger agreement, generally, the Forestar board of directors may not: (i) withdraw, modify, or propose publicly or resolve to withhold or modify, in any manner adverse to Merger Parent or
Merger Sub, the Company recommendation (a "change in Company recommendation"), (ii) adopt, approve, authorize, recommend or declare advisable any acquisition proposal, (iii) take or fail to take any
formal action or make or fail to make any public statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication by the board
of directors to Forestar's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iv) enter into an agreement relating to an acquisition proposal.

        If, prior to obtaining the Company stockholder approval, Forestar receives an acquisition proposal that the board of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, constitutes a superior proposal, the board of directors may effect a change in Company recommendation or terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive, written agreement concerning
such superior proposal, if:

• Forestar shall have provided prior written notice to Merger Parent, at least four business days in advance, of its intention to effect a change in Company recommendation or to terminate the
merger agreement to enter into a definitive, written agreement concerning a superior proposal, which notice shall contain certain information regarding the acquisition proposal specified in the
merger agreement, including the material terms and conditions and the identity of the person making the acquisition proposal; 

• the board of directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a change in Company recommendation or terminate the merger
agreement to enter into a superior proposal, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law and the Company shall have
complied with its obligations under the applicable provisions of the merger agreement; 

• after providing the required notice, Forestar and its representatives shall have discussed and negotiated with Merger Parent in good faith (to the extent Merger Parent has requested that Forestar
discuss and negotiate with Merger Parent and its representatives) during the notice

74



9/10/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1406587/000104746917003767/a2232315zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

period such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement as would permit the board of directors not to effect a change in Company recommendation or terminate the merger
agreement, as applicable; and

• the board of directors shall have considered any proposed changes to the merger agreement offered in writing by Merger Parent no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the last day of the notice
period, and, taking into account any such proposed changes, shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the superior proposal
would continue to constitute a superior proposal if such changes were to be given effect and the failure to take such action would continue to be inconsistent with the board of directors' fiduciary
duties to the Forestar stockholders under applicable law, and, in the case of any termination of the merger agreement in order to cause or permit Forestar to enter into an agreement concerning a
superior proposal, Forestar shall have validly terminated the merger agreement, including paying the required Company termination fee.

        The merger agreement does not prohibit the board of directors from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with respect to any acquisition proposal or making a "stop, look and listen"
disclosure of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

        In addition, the board of directors may effect a change in Company recommendation in response to certain intervening events that do not relate to Merger Parent or Merger Sub and were not known and not
reasonable foreseeable (or the implications and effects of which were not fully known) to the Forestar board of directors as of the date of the merger agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not
known or reasonable foreseeable) which event becomes known to the board of directors prior to the closing, if the board of directors shall have determined that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; provided, that, (i) Forestar promptly notified Merger Parent in writing at least four business days before taking such action, of its intention to do so, attaching a reasonably
detailed description of the facts relating to such adverse recommendation change, (ii) during such period, if requested by Merger Parent, Forestar negotiated with Merger Parent regarding any proposal by
Merger Parent to amend the terms of the merger agreement in response to such potential adverse recommendation change; and (iii) after such period, the board of directors determined that the failure to take
such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

Other Covenants and Agreements 

Access to Information

        Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, Forestar must afford to Merger Parent reasonable access at reasonable times on reasonable notice to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records, and Forestar must furnish promptly to Merger Parent a copy of every document it files pursuant to federal or state securities laws, and all other information concerning its business,
properties, litigation and personnel as Merger Parent may reasonably request (subject to Forestar's right to restrict access if such access would violate applicable law or its confidentiality obligations, would
result in the loss of attorney-client privilege, or, with respect to environmental investigations, would unreasonably intrude upon the operations of Forestar or its subsidiaries).

        No review by Merger Parent or its representatives will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty, covenant, or condition set forth in the merger agreement.

Indemnification and Insurance

        Merger Parent is required to cause the surviving entity to indemnify the present and former directors and officers of Forestar and its subsidiaries (the "indemnified persons") against all expenses

paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim alleged to occur at or prior to the closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the closing.

        The surviving entity must purchase as of the closing a tail endorsement to the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by Forestar which tail endorsement shall be effective
for a period of six years after the closing with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the closing, and the tail endorsement shall contain coverage at least as favorable to the
indemnified persons as the current coverage; provided, that in no event shall the surviving entity be required to pay annual premiums for insurance that exceed 300% of the most recent annual premiums paid by
Forestar prior to the date of the merger agreement. If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed that amount, the surviving entity shall be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for
such 300% amount.

        The limited partnership agreement of the surviving entity must include provisions for indemnification of the indemnified persons and employees on the same basis as set forth in Forestar's current
organizational documents. Following the closing, the surviving entity must maintain in effect such provisions in its limited partnership agreement providing for such indemnification with respect to the facts
occurring at or prior to the closing. After the closing, Merger Parent shall not amend the indemnification provisions of certain agreements listed in the Company disclosure letter between Forestar or any of its
subsidiaries and any of the indemnified persons or employees.

Efforts to Complete the Merger; Approvals

        The merger agreement provides that Forestar, Merger Parent and Merger Sub will each use their respective reasonable best efforts to:

• take all actions necessary under applicable laws to consummate the merger as promptly as practicable, including using their reasonable best efforts to obtain any requisite approvals by any
governmental entity or other third party in connection with the merger and to fulfill the conditions to the merger; and 

• not take any action that would materially delay or prevent consummation of the merger.

        Each of Forestar, on the one hand, and Merger Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, are required to:

• promptly notify the other of any substantive communications with any governmental entity with respect to the merger;

to enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other action that, in the reasonable judgment of Merger Parent, could be expected to limit the right of
Merger Parent or its subsidiaries to own or operate all or any portion of their respective businesses or assets, including those of Forestar.

Employee Matters

        From and after the closing, Merger Parent shall honor all employment agreements and Forestar employee benefit plans in accordance with their current terms, except as otherwise specifically provided in
the merger agreement.

        Merger Parent shall provide each Forestar employee who incurs a termination of employment during the twelve month period following the closing with severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits described in the Company disclosure letter, which are generally consistent with the Company's existing severance benefits. These severance benefits apply to employees at or below the
senior vice president level immediately before the closing date, and so will not apply to any of the Company's named executive officers. Severance benefits for the Company's named executive officers are
described in "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger".

Forestar Special Meeting

        Forestar has agreed to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of the merger agreement as promptly as practicable following the date
of the merger agreement.

Pre-Merger Transactions

        Upon Merger Parent's written request at least 10 business days prior to the closing, at or prior to the closing, Forestar shall cause each subsidiary that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (each, a "converted entity") to:

• convert into, at Merger Parent's election, a limited liability company or limited partnership (or other entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from Forestar for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) (a "disregarded entity"); 

• merge with and into a disregarded entity; and/or 

• make an election under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(c) to be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as applicable, in each case, such
that, at or prior to the closing, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each such converted entity is a disregarded entity;

provided that:

• Forestar shall not be required to take any such action that would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of, or materially delay the satisfaction of, any of the conditions set forth in
Article VII of the merger agreement; 

• Forestar and its subsidiaries shall not be required to take any such actions unless such actions are conditioned upon the occurrence of the closing; and 

• Forestar and its subsidiaries shall not take any of the actions contemplated above if, prior to the time specified for the taking of any such action by Merger Parent, Merger Parent provides written
notice to Forestar of its withdrawal of such direction.

        In all cases, the determination of the type of disregarded entity (e.g., limited partnership, limited liability company, etc.) shall be at the direction of Merger Parent. In the event the closing does not occur,
Merger Parent must reimburse Forestar for all filing fees and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses to the extent relating to the actions taken pursuant to the section of the merger
agreement dealing with the conversion of Forestar's corporate subsidiaries. Merger Parent also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Forestar and its subsidiaries and their representatives from and against any
and all liabilities incurred by them in connection with taking such actions (including any tax consequences).

Senior Secured Notes and Convertible Senior Notes

8.500% Senior Secured Notes Due 2022

        With respect to the Company's 8.500% senior secured notes due 2022, if reasonably requested by Merger Parent or Merger Sub, Forestar shall use its reasonable best efforts to:

• issue a notice of redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date agreed with Merger Parent for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the senior
secured notes pursuant to the requisite provisions of the indenture applicable thereto; and 

• take any actions reasonably requested by Merger Parent (which shall not require any payment by Forestar or its subsidiaries) that are customary or necessary to facilitate the redemption and/or
satisfaction and discharge of the notes pursuant to the indenture, and redeem and/or satisfy and discharge, as applicable, the notes in accordance with the indenture at the time at which the merger
becomes effective;

provided, that any such redemption and/or satisfaction and discharge must be conditioned on the occurrence of the closing and shall only be conducted in compliance with the indenture and applicable securities
laws.

3.75% Convertible Senior Notes

        As soon as reasonably practicable after the request by Merger Parent or Merger Sub to do so, Forestar shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect amendments and/or commence consent solicitations
related to its 3.75% convertible senior notes regarding the noteholders' conversion and repurchase rights and related timing and the payment of any fee or change in interest rate on such terms and conditions that
are specified and requested by Merger Parent. Merger Parent shall assist Forestar in connection with the foregoing (including entering into related supplemental indentures); provided that:

• Merger Parent will only request that Forestar conduct any convertible notes amendment in compliance with the applicable indenture and applicable securities laws; 

• any supplemental indentures will become operative only concurrently with the closing; and 

• Forestar is not obligated to enter into any supplemental indenture related to a convertible notes amendment if Forestar reasonably determines that such convertible notes amendment requires the
consent of all note holders and such consent has not been obtained or such amendment violates applicable securities laws.

        In addition, Forestar is required to take all actions as and when reasonably necessary to satisfy its obligations under the indenture with respect to the convertible notes in connection with the merger,
including entering into a supplemental indenture in accordance with the terms of the indenture.

Certain Additional Covenants

        The merger agreement also contains additional covenants, including covenants relating to events requiring the parties to give notice to one another, stockholder litigation, public announcements, reporting
requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the potential applicability of state takeover laws, the delisting of Forestar common stock from the NYSE, the obligations of Merger Sub, financing
cooperation, and cooperation relating to joint ventures.

ADVISORY VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (PROPOSAL 2) 

        Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to
vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the
section of this proxy statement entitled "The Merger—Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Merger-Related Compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers"
beginning on page 59 of this proxy statement. This non-binding advisory proposal gives Forestar stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related compensation of Forestar's named
executive officers.

        The Forestar board of directors encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement. The Forestar board of directors
unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the following resolution:

"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Forestar approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in
connection with the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Merger-Related Compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers" in Forestar's proxy statement for the special meeting."

        Company stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger and, as an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on the Company or the Forestar board of
directors. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and payments under them are, by their terms, not subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of
the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated our named executive officers will be entitled to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.

        The Forestar board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, specified compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger.

ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING (PROPOSAL 3)

agreement if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        The Company does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if Proposal No. 1 is approved by holders of the requisite number of shares of Forestar common stock at the special meeting.

        The Forestar board of directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or time if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit

MARKET PRICES AND DIVIDEND DATA 

        Forestar common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol "FOR."

        As of the close of business on the record date for the special meeting, there were 41,934,751 shares of Forestar common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, held by approximately 2,946 holders of
record of Forestar common stock. The following table sets forth during the periods indicated the high and low sales prices of Forestar common stock as reported on the NYSE for the periods indicated:

        We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. Under our current dividend policy, we intend to retain any future earnings to support our business. The declaration and payment of
any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including without limitation, our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our
business, the terms of any credit agreements or indentures to which we may be a party at the time, legal requirements, industry practice, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Under the
terms of the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the effective time of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, we may not declare or pay any dividends on
Forestar common stock without Merger Parent's written consent.

        The closing sale price of Forestar common stock on April 13, 2017, which was the last trading day prior to announcement of the merger agreement, was $14.15 per share. On June 1, 2017, the most recent
practicable date before this proxy statement was mailed to our stockholders, the closing price for Forestar common stock was $14.15 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for
Forestar common stock in connection with voting your shares of Forestar common stock.

        Following the merger, there will be no further market for Forestar common stock and we anticipate that our stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act. As a result,
following the merger and such deregistration, we would no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

Forestar, (ii) each director of Forestar and (iii) all such executive officers and directors as a group.

        Unless otherwise noted below, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table is c/o Forestar Group Inc., 6300 Bee Cave Road, Building Two, Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78746. We determined
beneficial ownership as reported in the table in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Unless otherwise indicated, beneficial ownership includes both sole voting and sole dispositive power. Even

might not claim beneficial ownership of shares owned by a relative. Unless otherwise indicated, the table does not include any shares that may be held by pension and profit-sharing plans of the corporations or
endowment funds of educational and charitable institutions for which various directors and officers serve as directors or trustees.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS 

        If the merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger proposal and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not withdraw such demand or lose
their right to appraisal will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex C and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their
appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of Forestar common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder's name. A person having a beneficial
interest in shares of Forestar common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized
below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Forestar common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you
should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.

        Under Section 262, holders of shares of Forestar common stock who (1) do not vote in favor of the merger proposal; (2) continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger; and
(3) otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive in lieu of the merger consideration
payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to be the "fair value" of the shares of Forestar common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made
by the surviving entity pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL). Unless the Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will
accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during such period. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or
less than the $14.25 per share consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement.

        Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its
stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Forestar's notice to stockholders that appraisal rights
are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the merger, any holder of shares of Forestar's common stock who
wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such holder's right to do so should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper
manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Forestar stockholders who assert appraisal rights
unless (x) the total number of shares of common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of Forestar outstanding shares of common stock measured in accordance with
subsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (y) the value of the merger consideration in respect of the shares of common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.

Table of Contents

        Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Forestar common stock, Forestar believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising
appraisal rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

        Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Forestar common stock must fully comply with Section 262, which means doing, among other things, ALL of the
following:

• the stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal; 

• the stockholder must deliver to Forestar a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting; 

• the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers
the shares before the effective time); and 

• the stockholder or the surviving entity must file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the
effective time of the merger. The surviving entity is under no obligation to file any petition.

Filing Written Demand 

        Any holder of shares of Forestar common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Forestar at the address below, before the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting, a written
demand for the appraisal of the stockholder's shares, and that stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal either in person or by proxy. A holder of shares of Forestar common stock exercising
appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is
submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger proposal, and it will cause a stockholder to lose the stockholder's right to appraisal and will nullify any
previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the
merger proposal or abstain from voting on the merger proposal. However neither voting against the merger proposal nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the merger proposal will, in and of itself,
constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the merger proposal. A
stockholder's failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting will cause the stockholder to lose its appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

        Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder's name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of common stock should
be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Forestar of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder's shares in
connection with the merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the
shares are owned of record by more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an
authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in
executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.

        STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEES AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD
CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE
TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH
AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY
TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

        All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Forestar Group Inc.
6300 Bee Cave Road

Building Two, Suite 500
Austin, Texas 78746

Attn: General Counsel

        Any holder of shares of Forestar common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration by delivering to Forestar a written withdrawal of the demand for
appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written approval of the surviving entity. No appraisal proceeding in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be dismissed without the approval of such court and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just.

Notice by the Surviving Entity 

        If the merger is completed, within ten days after the Effective Time, the surviving entity will notify each holder of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to
Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the merger proposal of the date that the merger has become effective.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal 

        Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving entity or any holder of shares of Forestar common stock who has demanded appraisal rights under Section 262 may
commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, with a copy served on the surviving entity in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a
determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's
own name file a petition for appraisal. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. None of Starwood, Merger Parent or the surviving entity is under any obligation, and
has no present intention, to file such a petition, and holders should not assume that Starwood, Merger Parent, or the surviving entity will file a petition. Accordingly, any holders of shares of Forestar common
stock who desire to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery should assume that they will be responsible for filing a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery in the manner prescribed in
Section 262. The failure of a holder of Forestar common stock to file such a petition for appraisal within the period specified in Section 262 will nullify the stockholder's previous written demand for appraisal.

        Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of Forestar common stock who has complied with the requirements for the exercise of appraisal rights, or a beneficial owner of
shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving entity a statement setting forth the aggregate number of

Table of Contents

shares not voted in favor of the merger proposal and with respect to which Forestar received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving entity must mail this
statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal,
whichever is later.

        If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Forestar common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving entity, the surviving entity will then be obligated within twenty
days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is empowered to conduct a hearing on
the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who
demanded appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the
direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings.

Determination of Fair Value 

        After determining the holders of Forestar common stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will appraise the "fair value" of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Court of
Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal
proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered, and that "
[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the merger which throw any light on future
prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of
value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court also stated that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or
susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered."

        Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could be more than, the same as or less
than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view
of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Forestar believes that the merger consideration is fair,
no representation is made by Forestar, Starwood, SOF-X U.S. Holdings, the surviving entity or Merger Parent as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the merger

consideration. Each of Forestar, Starwood, SOF-X U.S. Holdings, the surviving entity and Merger Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the "fair
value" of a share of Forestar common stock is less than the $14.25 per share consideration.

        Unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective time through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective time of the merger and the
date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving entity may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest
shall accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued,
unless paid at that time. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys' fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses
incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares
entitled to be appraised.

        If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Forestar's common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder's right to appraisal, the
stockholder's shares of common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the merger consideration. From and after the effective time of the merger,
no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of Forestar common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except
dividends or other distributions on the holder's shares of Forestar common stock, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the effective time of the merger.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        If the merger is completed, Forestar will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any of our future stockholder meetings. Forestar intends to hold its 2018 annual meeting of
stockholders only if the merger is not completed by that time. If the merger is not completed, the Company's stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in our stockholder meetings.
Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, stockholders may present appropriate proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and for consideration at our annual meeting of stockholders by submitting
their proposals to us in a timely manner. For a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for our 2018 annual meeting, the proposal must be received by our Secretary by
November 28, 2017 and must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8. Any stockholder proposal received after November 28, 2017 will not be considered for inclusion in our 2018 proxy statement.

        Our bylaws contain an advance notice procedure with regard to items of business and director nominations to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders by a stockholder. These procedures
require that notice be made in writing to our Secretary and the item of business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. The notice must be received at our executive offices not less than
75 days nor more than 100 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. In the case of an annual meeting called for a date more than 50 days prior to the
anniversary date, notice must be received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which notice of the annual meeting date is first mailed to stockholders or made public,
whichever occurs first. Stockholder proposals to be brought before our 2018 annual meeting and submitted outside the processes of Rule 14a-8 will be considered untimely if they are submitted before
January 29, 2018 or after February 23, 2018. Our bylaws require that the notice of the proposal contain certain information concerning the proposing stockholder and the proposal or director nominee.

assets to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes as provided herein) provided for herein to be provided to the holders of Company Common Stock and the
assumption of all of the Company's other liabilities, followed by a distribution of such consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock in liquidation pursuant to Section 331 of the Code.

ARTICLE III

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

        Section 3.1    Effect on Capital Stock.     Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or of any partnership interests in Merger Sub:

        (a)    Conversion of Company Common Stock.    Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but not including shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, payable to the holder thereof, equal to $14.25 (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any Company Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes as provided herein), to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor in accordance with Section 3.2, without interest.

        (b)    Conversion of Merger Sub Partnership Interests.    All of the partnership interests of Merger Sub that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and
unchanged by virtue of the Merger as an outstanding partnership interest of the Surviving Entity, and such partnership interests shall continue to be owned by Parent.

        (c)    Cancellation of Certain Shares.    Each share, if any, of Company Common Stock that is held by the Company as a treasury share and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by
the Company or Parent or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent shall be cancelled without any conversion, and no consideration shall be delivered in respect
thereof.

        (d)    Company Equity Awards.    As of the Effective Time, (i) each award made or otherwise denominated in shares of Company Common Stock (an "Equity Award") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans shall be cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time and (ii) in exchange for the cancellation of such
Equity Award, the holder of such Equity Award shall receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Equity Award (plus payment of cash of all accrued
dividend equivalents, if any, with respect to such Equity Awards and, in the case of Equity Awards that are stock options or stock appreciation rights, less the aggregate exercise or strike price thereunder,
but not less than $0), whether or not otherwise vested as of the Effective Time (with such payment to be subject to any applicable Tax withholding in accordance with Section 3.1(e)), provided that with
respect to any such Equity Awards that vest upon the achievement of performance-based metrics, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Equity Awards shall be determined
pursuant to the terms set forth in the applicable award agreements. The payments described in this Section 3.1(d) shall be made upon the earliest date upon which such payments may be made without
resulting in the imposition of Taxes upon the recipient pursuant to the operation of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and applicable Treasury Regulations issued pursuant
thereto (the "Code"). The Company and, as necessary, the Surviving Entity will take all actions necessary to effect this Section 3.1(d).

        (e)    Withholding.    Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock or Equity Awards such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock or Equity Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent.

        Section 3.2    Exchange of Shares and Certificates.     

        (a)    Paying Agent.    Prior to the Closing, Parent shall engage a nationally-recognized financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent in connection with the
Merger (the "Paying Agent"). At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time, cash equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Common Stock. All cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred
to as the "Exchange Fund." If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent
will, or will cause Merger Sub (or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity) to, promptly deposit cash with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency required to fully satisfy
such cash payment obligations.

        (b)    Exchange Procedures.    Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"), in each case, which
at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which, in the case of Certificates, shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in

effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (1) surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto or (2) receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange the Merger Consideration (less applicable
withholding Taxes) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1, and any Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (I) either such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (II) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent
any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2(b), each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes as provided herein), without interest, upon such surrender.

        (c)    No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.    All Merger Consideration issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in accordance
with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Entity of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.

        (d)    Termination of Exchange Fund.    Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Entity for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, and Parent and the Surviving Entity shall remain jointly and severally liable for, payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

        (e)    No Liability.    None of Parent, the Surviving Entity, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any
Person in respect of Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall not have
been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such cash shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

        (f)    Investment of Exchange Fund.    The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to former stockholders of the Company after the Effective Time pursuant to this Article III. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this Article III shall promptly be paid to Parent.

Table of Contents

        (g)    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.    In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such portion of the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes as provided herein) as may be required
pursuant to Section 3.1(a); provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Paying Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

        Section 3.3    Dissenting Shares.     Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who properly exercise appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled only to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Common Stock will thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

thereunder, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date so filed, except to the extent updated,
amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent Company SEC Report filed prior to the date of the Agreement. None of the Company SEC Reports (excluding any financial statements or schedules
included or incorporated by reference therein) contained when filed any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent Company SEC Report.

to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules of the SEC with respect thereto and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as may be
permitted by Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, as applicable, and subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to the absence of notes and to normal, recurring year-end
audit adjustments which were not material). The consolidated balance sheets (including the related notes) included in such Company Financial Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or
corrected by a subsequent Company SEC Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at the respective
dates thereof, and the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows (in each case, including the related notes) included in such Company Financial Statements (if applicable,
as updated, amended, restated or corrected in a subsequent Company SEC Report) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of

        (c)   With respect to the Company SEC Reports, each of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) have made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any

        (d)   The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is
reasonably designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes.

Company) and the Company Board have not been advised of and the Company has not identified any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by the Public Company Accounting

connection therewith, or any termination thereof, as promptly as possible (but in any event within 24 hours following such amendment or termination or receipt of such notices).

        Section 5.7    Merger Sub's Operations.     Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and has not owned any assets, engaged
in any business activities or conducted any operations, and will not at any time prior to the Effective Time own any assets, engage in any business activities or conduct any operations, in each case, other than in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

        Section 5.8    Section 203 Matters.     Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, nor at any time during the last three years has it been, an "interested stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than
as contemplated by this Agreement).

        Section 5.9    Solvency.     Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in Article IV that relate to the subject matter of clauses (i) - (iii) of this Section 5.9 (including
Section 4.7), after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement (including payment of all amounts payable under Article I and Article III in connection with or as a result of the Merger) and the payment of all related fees and expenses, Parent
and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) will be Solvent as of the Closing Date immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent" when used with respect to any Person, shall mean that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will,
as of such date, exceed (A) the sum of the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities" as of such date, and the capital of such Person as computed in accordance with
applicable Law as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" mean that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancings,
or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. Parent is not entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

        Section 5.10    Disclosure Documents.     The information with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that Parent or Merger Sub furnishes, or causes to be furnished, to the Company in writing
specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, at the time of the mailing thereof or at the time the Company Stockholders Meeting is to be held, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

        Section 5.11    Compliance with Laws and Orders.     Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all respects with all Laws and Orders applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which
any property, business or asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected and has not been given written notice of any violation of any such Laws or Orders, except for failures to comply with or
violation of such Laws or Orders as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

limited partnership (the "Guarantor"), in favor of Company with respect to certain obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
Law). No event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under such Guarantee.

representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in this Article V, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Person makes or has made any representation or warranty to the Company or any of its
Representatives, with respect to (i) any financial projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospective information relating to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or operations or (ii) any
oral or written information furnished or made available to the Company or any of its Representatives in the course of its due diligence investigation of Parent, the negotiation of this Agreement or the

to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other Person has made or is making any representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied,
beyond those expressly made by the Company in Article IV, including any implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company furnished or made
available to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives.

or state securities Laws, and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties, litigation matters and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided, that nothing in this Section 6.2 shall
require the Company to provide any access, or to disclose any information, if permitting such access or disclosing such information would (x) violate applicable Law, (y) violate any of its obligations
with respect to confidentiality (provided, that the Company shall, upon the request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of any third party to such access or disclosure),

give prompt notice to the Company and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, as the case may be, of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is
reasonably likely to cause (a) (i) any representation or warranty of such Party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to "materiality", "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation or warranty of such Party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time
from and after the date hereof until the Closing or (b) any material failure of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. In addition, from and after the date hereof and until the earlier to occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1,

this Section 6.3 will not limit or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties, the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice or the conditions to
such Party's obligation to consummate the Merger. This Section 6.3 shall not constitute a covenant, agreement or obligation of the Company for purposes of Section 8.1(d)(i) or Section 7.2(b).

        Section 6.4    Approvals.     

        (a)   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain any requisite approvals, consents, authorizations, orders, exemptions or waivers by any Governmental Entity or
other third party (provided that in respect of Contracts between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any third party, none of the Parties shall be required to make or agree to make any payment or
accept any material conditions or obligations) in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fulfill the conditions to the Merger and (ii) not take any
action that would materially delay or prevent consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (b)   Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall (i) promptly notify the other of and, if in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case of
oral communications, advise the other of) any substantive communications from or with any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed substantive written or oral communication with any such
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) not participate in any substantive meeting or have any substantive communication with
any such Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it has given the other an opportunity to consult with it in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other the opportunity to attend and participate therein and (iv) furnish the other with copies of all filings and communications between it and any
such Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights of the Parties under
this Section 6.4(b) may be exercised on their behalf by their respective outside counsel and that materials may be redacted (x) to remove reference concerning valuation, (y) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements and (z) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concern.

        (c)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any
consent decree, to make any divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other action that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, could be expected to limit the right of Parent or its
Subsidiaries to own or operate all or any portion of their respective businesses or assets, including those of the Company. With regard to any Governmental Entity, neither the Company nor any of its
respective affiliates shall, without Parent's written consent, in Parent's sole discretion, discuss, propose or commit to any divestiture transaction, or discuss, propose or commit to alter their businesses or
commercial practices in any way, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Parent's freedom of action with respect to, or Parent's ability to retain any of the businesses, product lines or
assets of, the Company or otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement; provided that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any such action unless such action is
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

similar agreement between the Company and such Third Person. From and after the date of this Agreement, except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.5, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
(and the Company shall direct its and their respective Representatives not to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, request, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing or
disclosing information) any proposal, offer or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or take any other action to facilitate or initiate the making of any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with, furnish or make available any information, or afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Third Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, offer or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) amend or grant any waiver or release under or fail to enforce any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, unless the Company Board after considering advice from outside legal counsel to the Company that the failure to waive or release or fail to enforce such provision would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws of the State of Delaware, (iv) approve any Third Person becoming an "interested stockholder" under Section 203 of the DGCL,
(v) enter into any agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar Contract relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than the confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 6.5(b)(iii)) (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") or (vi) propose publicly to do any of the foregoing. Nothing in this
Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives from informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 6.5 or
clarifying the terms and conditions thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section 6.5 by any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective
Representatives shall be deemed a breach of this Section 6.5 by the Company.

        (b)   Notwithstanding Section 6.5(a), at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives may participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding, and furnish or disclose information (including non-public information) in response to, an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which was made after
the date of this Agreement and did not result from any breach of this Section 6.5 that is submitted to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives; provided that (i) the

Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, based on the information then available and after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's

Acquisition Proposal, the Company receives from such Third Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms not less favorable to the Company than the terms then applicable under the
Confidentiality Agreement and (iv) promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) after furnishing or making available any non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries to any
such Third Person, the Company furnishes or makes available such information to Parent or its Representatives (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished or made available by the
Company to Parent or its Representatives).

        (c)   The Company shall notify Parent in writing promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives of any
Acquisition Proposal, any bona fide written indication that a Third Person intends to make an Acquisition Proposal or any written request for information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case by any Third Person that intends to make an Acquisition Proposal in connection therewith. The
Company shall identify the Third Person making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any material changes thereto). The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any changes
thereto), and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications addressing such matters).

        (d)   Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.5, the Company Board shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, or propose publicly or resolve to withhold, withdraw, modify,
amend or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation (a "Change in Company Recommendation") (it being understood that the Company Board may refrain
from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business of the tenth Business Day following a written request by Parent to the Company Board to affirm the Company
Recommendation after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered an adverse modification), (ii) adopt, approve,
authorize or recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, approve, authorize or recommend or otherwise declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) take or fail to take
any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and

communication) or (iv) enter into any Acquisition Agreement.

        (e)   If, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may effect a Change in Company Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) to enter into a definitive, written agreement concerning such Superior Proposal, if, and only if:

          (i)  the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to effect a Change in Company
Recommendation pursuant to this Section 6.5(e) or to terminate this Agreement to

enter into a definitive, written agreement concerning a Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), which notice shall specify the basis for such Change in Company Recommendation or
termination and the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions thereof and all material documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal; provided that
in the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice
to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.5(e) with respect to such new written notice (it being understood that the "Notice Period" in respect of such new written notice
shall be two Business Days);

         (ii)  the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Change in Company Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and the Company shall have
complied in all material respects with all of its obligations under this Section 6.5;

        (iii)  after providing the notice contemplated by Section 6.5(e)(i), the Company shall have discussed and negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to discuss and negotiate, with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent has requested that the Company discuss and negotiate with Parent and its Representatives) during the Notice Period such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to effect a Change in Company Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into a
Superior Proposal, as applicable; and

        (iv)  (A) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any proposed changes to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the last day
of the Notice Period, and, taking into account any such proposed changes, shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given effect and the failure to take such action would continue to be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and (B) in the case of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Acquisition Agreement concerning a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance
with Section 8.1(c), including paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.2(h).

        (f)    Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal; provided that any such position taken or disclosed that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Recommendation unless the
Company Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such Acquisition Proposal requiring compliance with Rule 14e-2(a) no later than the ten business day
deadline set forth in Rule 14e-2(a) or (ii) making a "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of

to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement) in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; provided, that, (i) the Company promptly notified
Parent in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action, of its intention to do so, attaching a reasonably detailed description of the facts relating to such Change in Company
Recommendation, (ii) during such four Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith (to the extent that Parent has
requested that the Company discuss and negotiate) with Parent and its Representatives regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such potential Change in
Company Recommendation; and (iii) after such four Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after considering advice from its outside legal counsel, and taking
into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement made during such period, that the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

litigation of which the Company has knowledge, in each case relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep Parent fully informed regarding any such stockholder
litigation. Without limiting the preceding sentence, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such
stockholder litigation (and the Company will in good faith take such comments into account), the opportunity to consult on any settlement, understanding or other agreement with respect to such stockholder
litigation; provided, however that without Parent's prior written consent the Company shall only be permitted to offer to make or make any payment with respect to any such stockholder litigation and to enter
into any settlement, understanding or other agreement relating to any such stockholder litigation if the terms thereof, in the aggregate, are no less favorable to the Company than those described in Section 6.6 of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

        Section 6.7    Indemnification; Director and Officer Insurance.     

        (a)   Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, the present and former directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each such director or officer an "Indemnified Person"), in each case to the fullest extent a Delaware corporation would be permitted by Law to indemnify such individuals, including to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date hereof that increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify its officers and
directors, from and against any and all costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any circumstances, developments or matters in existence, or acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur at or prior to the Effective Time (including, throughout this Section 6.7, for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the negotiation, execution, delivery and approval of this Agreement, the performance of the Company's obligations hereunder and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or arising out of or pertaining to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and any other transaction considered by the Company in lieu of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby) whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time.

directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company which tail endorsement shall be effective for a period from the Effective Time through and including the date six years after the
Closing Date (a "Reporting Tail Endorsement") with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, and which Reporting Tail Endorsement shall contain
coverage and amounts at least as favorable to the Indemnified Persons as the coverage currently provided by Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies (in the aggregate);
provided, that in no event shall the Surviving Entity and Parent be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this Section 6.7(b) that exceed 300% of the most recent annual premiums paid by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to the date of this Agreement for such purpose, it being understood that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
the Surviving Entity and Parent, as applicable, shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount. Such Reporting Tail Endorsement shall be placed
through such broker(s) as may be specified by Parent and as is reasonably acceptable to the Company. Notwithstanding the first and second sentences of this Section 6.7(b), the Company shall be
permitted at its sole and exclusive option to purchase the Reporting Tail Endorsement (in lieu of the Surviving Entity) prior to the Effective Time, subject to the proviso of the first sentence of this
Section 6.7(b).

        (c)   The limited partnership agreement of the Surviving Entity shall include provisions for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified
Persons and employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries on the same basis as set forth in the Company Organizational Documents in effect on the date hereof with such changes as may be
reasonably necessary as a result of the Surviving Entity's organization as a limited partnership and which will not adversely impact the Indemnified Persons' or employees' rights to indemnification,
advancement and reimbursement of expenses or exculpation in any material respects. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain in
effect such provisions in its limited partnership agreement providing for such indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of Indemnified Persons and employees, as
applicable, with respect to the facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in the case of the Indemnified Persons, to the fullest extent permitted from time to time under applicable
Law, which provisions shall not be amended except as required by applicable Law.

        (d)   From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not, directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate the indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of
expenses and exculpation provisions of the agreements listed in Section 6.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter between the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and any of the Indemnified
Persons or employees, or any such provisions contained in the Surviving Entity's organizational documents to the extent such provisions apply to Indemnified Persons or employees.

        (e)   Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.7(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Parent and the Surviving
Entity thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Surviving Entity of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Person to the extent such failure does not materially prejudice the
indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), as of the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Entity
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof through counsel (i) with recognized competence and experience in connection with claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations of the type
involved, and (ii) reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Persons, and neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to such Indemnified Persons for any legal expenses of other counsel or any

assume such defense or counsel or the Indemnified Persons advise that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Entity and the Indemnified Persons or between
the Indemnified Persons, the Indemnified Persons may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
for the Indemnified Persons promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, however, pursuant to this Section 6.7(e), (x) the Indemnified Persons will cooperate in the defense of any such matter
and (y) neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; and
provided, further, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Person in the manner contemplated by Section 6.7(a) is prohibited by applicable Law.
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in respect of which
indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Person hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability
arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Entity may not replace any counsel engaged by any Indemnified Person prior to the Effective Time without the prior written consent of such
Indemnified Person.

        (f)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified
Persons or employee on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.7 shall continue in effect until the final and non-appealable disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

        (g)   The covenants and agreements contained in this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of and to grant third-party rights to, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Persons or employees and their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Person or employee is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Entity. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity under this
Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person or employee unless the affected Indemnified Person or employee shall have consented in
writing to such termination or modification. It is expressly agreed that each Indemnified Person and or employee shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.7, and entitled to enforce the
covenants and agreements contained in this Section 6.7. If any Indemnified Person or employee makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.7 that is denied by
Parent and/or the Surviving Entity, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Person or employee is entitled to such indemnification, then Parent or the Surviving Entity shall
pay such Indemnified Person's or employee's costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against Parent and/or the Surviving Entity. The
rights of the Indemnified Persons and employees under this Section 6.7 shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any rights such Indemnified Persons or employees may have under the
Company Organizational Documents, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of any of the Company's Subsidiaries or the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Entity or under any applicable Contracts, insurance policies or Laws and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Parties hereto, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy
Statement and in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this Section 6.16(d) shall limit the obligations of any Party under

additional proxies and votes required to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to allow reasonable additional
time for any supplemental or amended disclosure if the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and then only for the minimum time as the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
counsel is reasonably necessary to give the holders of Company Common Stock the required time to evaluate any applicable information or disclosure; provided, further, that the Company shall, if

reasonable forecasts of the actual damages which may be incurred by Parent under such circumstances. The amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2 constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to Section 9.13, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that (i) Parent's right to receive payment of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2 (plus any costs, expenses or interest payable in connection therewith pursuant to Section 8.2(h)) in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee

thereafter Parent is entitled to receive the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2, any such amounts payable as the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall be reduced
by the aggregate amount of any payments made by the Company to Parent or Merger Sub in respect of any such breaches of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the maximum aggregate liability of the Company for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of the Parent or Merger Sub relating to the failure of the Merger to be consummated, or a breach of this

Company Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Merger, the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law
arising out of any such breach, termination or failure.

        (f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub together for any losses, damages, costs or expenses of the Company

Fee (the "Parent Liability Limitation"), and in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates seek any amount in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the
Merger or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in
equity, in contract, tort or otherwise. The Company agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, any of the Parent Related Parties (other than Parent or Merger
Sub to the extent provided in this Agreement), through Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company

applicable Law, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except for its rights to recover from the Guarantor (but not any other Parent Related Party) under and to the extent provided in the Guarantee and
subject to the Parent Liability Limitation and the other limitations described therein. Recourse against the Guarantor under the Guarantee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and their
respective Affiliates against the Guarantor and any other Parent Related Party (other than Parent or Merger Sub to the extent provided in this Agreement) in connection with this Agreement or the
Merger or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Without limiting the rights of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, in no event shall the Company or its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover damages from, any Parent Related Party (other than the Guarantor to the extent provided in the Guarantee and subject to
the Parent Liability Limitation and the other limitations described therein).

        (g)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.2, it is agreed that Parent and Merger Sub will be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as
provided in Section 9.13.

subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee (less any Parent Expense Reimbursement previously paid to Parent by the Company). For the avoidance of doubt, (x) in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Parent Expense Reimbursement on more than one occasion and (y) in no event shall the sum of the Parent Expense Reimbursement and Company Termination Fee

the Party failing to pay such amounts shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of the other Party in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit
or other legal action, taken by such other Party to collect payment that results in a judgment against the Party for such amounts due under this Section 8.2.

time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and prior to the Effective Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein; provided, however, that after the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Company

(ii) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions of any other Party or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement

        Section 9.4    Counterparts.     This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic method), all of which shall be considered one and the same

including the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) except for (i) following the Effective Time, the rights of the Company's stockholders to receive the payments provided for herein and (ii) the provisions of

(whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law that

Table of Contents

        Section 9.9    Headings, etc.     The headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The disclosure of any matter in the Company Disclosure Letter shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company or Parent, respectively, or to otherwise imply, that any such
matter is material for the purpose of this Agreement.

        Section 9.10    Severability.     If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by the Parties. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties
as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

        Section 9.11    Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.     No failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a
waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

        Section 9.12    Waiver of Jury Trial.     EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS
AGREEMENT.

        Section 9.13    Specific Performance.     The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur and that Parent and Merger Sub would not have any adequate remedy at Law (a) for any
actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement or (b) in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly
agreed that, except where this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement and any other agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith, in each case, if the conditions set forth in
Article VII have been satisfied or waived, and the Company further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or proving actual damages in connection with such remedy. The
Company hereby consents to the right of Parent and Merger Sub to seek the issuance of such injunction or injunctions, and to the grant of such injunction or injunctions. The Company further agrees that (i) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 9.13, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such Party under this
Agreement, including payment of the Company Termination Fee, other monetary damages or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 9.13 are not available or otherwise are not granted and
(ii) nothing contained in this Section 9.13 shall require Parent or Merger Sub to institute any proceeding for (or limit either such Party's right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
Section 9.13 before exercising any termination right under Section 8.1 (and pursuing the payment of the Company Termination Fee or other monetary damages after such termination) nor shall the
commencement of any action pursuant to this Section 9.13 or anything contained in this Section 9.13 restrict or limit any Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 8.1 or
pursue any

other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with this
Section 9.13 and payment of the Company Termination Fee or other monetary damages, as applicable, under no circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance requiring consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any such payment. The Company further agrees not to assert that a remedy of
specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide for an adequate remedy. The Parties agree that the
Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or the
Financing Commitment and that the Company's sole and exclusive remedy relating to a breach of the Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub otherwise shall be the remedy set forth in Section 8.2(c); provided,
however, that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of Section 6.2.

ANNEX B
OPINION OF JMP SECURITIES LLC 

April 13, 2017

The Board of Directors
Forestar Group Inc.
6300 Bee Cave Road
Building Two, Suite 500
Austin, Texas 78746-5149

Dear Board of Directors:

        We understand that Forestar Group Inc. ("Forestar") is contemplating a merger of Forestar with and into Terra Firma Merger Sub, L.P. ("Merger Sub" and, such merger, the "Transaction"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Terra Firma Merger Parent, L.P. ("Parent"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement (as defined below). We also understand that the Agreement provides that, by virtue
of the Transaction, each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Forestar ("Forestar Common Stock"), other than shares held by Forestar, Parent or their respective subsidiaries and
Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $14.25 in cash (the "Consideration"). We further understand that Parent is a newly-formed entity affiliated with certain
investment funds managed by affiliates of Starwood Capital Group.

        The Board of Directors of Forestar (the "Board") (i) will be considering certain financial aspects of the Transaction, among other matters, prior to deciding whether or not to approve the execution and
delivery of the Agreement and (ii) has requested our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of Forestar Common Stock (other than Parent and its affiliates) in the Transaction is
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        For purposes of our opinion, we have:

1. reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft dated April 12, 2017 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger to be entered into by Forestar, Parent and Merger Sub (the "Agreement"); 

2. reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Forestar, including Forestar's audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and
2014; 

3. reviewed certain financial projections provided to us by Forestar relating to Forestar and its core development projects, as well as to the estimated sale value of Forestar's multifamily assets, and
certain other historical and current financial and business information provided to us by Forestar, including certain third party appraisals and other purchase price information provided to us by
Forestar relating to certain other real estate assets of Forestar; 

4. held discussions regarding the operations, financial condition and prospects of Forestar with the senior management of Forestar;

5. reviewed for informational purposes the premiums paid in certain publicly announced mergers and acquisitions transactions in certain real estate industries; 

6. reviewed the current and historical trading prices and volume for Forestar Common Stock; 

7. considered the results of Forestar's efforts, with our assistance, to solicit indications of interest and definitive proposals from certain third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of Forestar;
and 

8. performed such other studies, analyses and inquiries and considered such other factors as we deemed appropriate.

        In arriving at our opinion, we have, with your consent, (i) relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information without independent verification, (ii) not assumed any
responsibility for independently verifying such information, and (iii) relied on the assurances of the senior management of Forestar that it is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such
information inaccurate or misleading. In addition, with your consent, we have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Forestar (with
respect to any of its core development projects or otherwise), nor have we been furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals except as described above. With respect to the financial projections referred to
above and any other forecasts or forward-looking information, we have assumed, at the direction of the senior management of Forestar that such projections, forecasts and information were reasonably prepared
and reflect the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of such management as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Forestar and the other matters covered
thereby, and we have relied on such information in arriving at our opinion. With respect to the third party appraisals and other purchase price information referred to above, we have assumed, at the direction of
the senior management of Forestar, that such third party appraisals and other purchase price information represent reasonable estimates of the values of the assets of Forestar to which they relate, and we have
relied on such information in arriving at our opinion.

        In addition, in arriving at our opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, that (i) all material information we have requested from Forestar during the scope of our engagement has been provided to us
fully and in good faith, (ii) the Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement (the final terms and conditions of which we have assumed will not differ
in any respect material to our analysis from the aforementioned draft we have reviewed), without any waiver, modification or amendment of any material terms or conditions, (iii) the representations and
warranties made by the parties to the Agreement are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis, (iv) all governmental and third party consents, approvals and agreements necessary for the
consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on Forestar or the Transaction, and (v) the Transaction will not violate any applicable federal or state statutes, rules or regulations.

        This opinion does not constitute legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, tax or other similar professional advice and does not address (i) the underlying decision of Forestar to proceed with or effect the
Transaction, (ii) the terms of the Transaction (other than the Consideration to the extent expressly addressed herein) or any arrangements, understandings, agreements or documents related to the Transaction,
(iii) the fairness of the Transaction (other than with respect to the Consideration to the extent expressly addressed herein) or any other transaction to Forestar's equity holders or creditors or any other person or
entity, including, without limitation, the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Forestar or
the fairness of the Consideration relative to any such consideration, (iv) the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative strategy or transaction that might exist for Forestar, or the effect of
any other transaction which it may consider in the future,

(v) the tax, accounting or legal consequences of the Transaction, or (vi) the solvency, creditworthiness, fair market value or fair value of any of Forestar, Parent or their respective assets under any applicable
laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar matters. This opinion expresses no opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or
employees of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be received by the holders of Forestar Common Stock.

        Our opinion is necessarily based on business, economic, monetary, market and other conditions as they exist and can reasonably be evaluated on, and the information made available to us as of, the date
hereof. Subsequent developments may affect this opinion, and we assume no responsibility for updating or revising our opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date hereof (regardless of
the closing date of the Transaction). We have not been engaged to amend, supplement or update this opinion at any time. We express no view or opinion as to the prices at which Forestar Common Stock may be
purchased, sold or exchanged, or otherwise be transferable, at any time. We also express no view or opinion as to the prices at which any of the real estate assets of Forestar may be purchased, sold or
exchanged, or otherwise be transferable, at any time.

        We have acted as a financial advisor to Forestar with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a portion of which became payable upon our engagement, a portion of which
is payable upon the delivery of this opinion and a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed Transaction is consummated. In addition, (i) Forestar has agreed to indemnify us against
certain claims and liabilities related to or arising out of our engagement, and (ii) we may seek to provide financial advisory services to Forestar, Parent, Starwood Capital Group or their respective affiliates in
the future, for which we would expect to receive compensation. This opinion was approved by a JMP Securities LLC fairness opinion committee.

        This opinion is directed and addressed to the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the Transaction. This opinion does not (i) constitute a recommendation as to how the
Board or any shareholder should act or vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter, and (ii) create any fiduciary duties on the part of JMP Securities LLC to any persons or entities.

        Based upon and subject to and in reliance on the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by the holders of Forestar Common Stock (other than Parent and its
affiliates) in the Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

Very truly yours,

ANNEX C 

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE 

§ 262. Appraisal rights. 

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously
holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the
circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean
and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions
thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository. 

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected
pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b) (3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title: 

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or
depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any
shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of
this title. 

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders
thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except: 

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof; 

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective
date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders; 

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or 

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of
this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger,
appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation. 

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and
the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words "merger
or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation." 

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its
certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e) and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable. 

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows: 

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days
prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this
title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent
corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to
demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such
stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of
such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written
demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or 

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation
or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights
of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such
notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice or, in the case of

a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice,
demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such
constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all
such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a
merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice,
such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An
affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that
shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such
effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is
given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and
who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined
that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive
from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect
to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's
written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this
section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of
such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection. 

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of
the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names

and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation.
If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice
of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated.
Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such
publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting
corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders
who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the
shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all
holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for
appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this
title. 

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically
governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the
judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective
date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined
by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may
participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates
representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or
of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be
charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal. 

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any
purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the
merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving
or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to
withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in
subsection (e) of this section. 

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status
of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
