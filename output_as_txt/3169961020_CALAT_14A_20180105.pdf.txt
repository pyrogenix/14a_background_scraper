PROPOSED MERGER—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT
 

 

Dear CalAtlantic and Lennar Stockholders,

CalAtlantic Group, Inc. (“CalAtlantic”) and Lennar Corporation (“Lennar”) have agreed to a strategic merger (the “Merger”) that will create the
largest homebuilder in the United States and is expected to generate significant operating and administrative cost savings for the combined entity.

If the Merger is completed, each holder of a share of CalAtlantic common stock will become entitled to receive 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A
common stock (NYSE:LEN) and 0.0177 shares of Lennar Class B common stock (NYSE:LENB). CalAtlantic stockholders will have the option to
receive cash equal to $48.26 per CalAtlantic share instead of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock, subject to proration such that the CalAtlantic
stockholders who elect to receive cash will receive in the aggregate no more than $1,162,250,000 in cash (which limits the cash elections to 24,083,091
shares of CalAtlantic common stock). If cash elections exceed this maximum amount, the cash paid to stockholders who elect to receive cash will be
prorated, with the remainder of the merger consideration to which they are entitled being in the form of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock. On
the last trading day before the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 29, 2017 (the “merger agreement”), was signed, 0.885 shares of Lennar
Class A common stock had a market value of $51.34, based on the closing price per share for such shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the
“NYSE”) as of that date. The additional right to receive Lennar Class B common stock is the result of a stock dividend that Lennar distributed after the
date of the merger agreement, which CalAtlantic stockholders will receive as though they had been Lennar stockholders on the record date for the stock
dividend. On January 2, 2018, the most recent practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the last sale price of
Lennar Class A common stock reported on the NYSE was $64.84 per share and the last sale price of Lennar’s Class B common stock reported on the
NYSE was $52.61 per share. Based on those prices, the market value of 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A common stock and 0.0177 shares of Lennar
Class B common stock was $58.31. The value of such Class A and Class B shares when the Merger is consummated will depend on the price per share
of each class of Lennar’s common stock on the NYSE at that time. The Merger is intended to qualify as a “reorganization” for U.S. tax purposes, which
means that CalAtlantic stockholders will not have a taxable event when they receive Lennar stock. They will have a taxable event to the extent they
receive cash.

The CalAtlantic stockholders are being asked to vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement. The proposal requires the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of CalAtlantic common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. MP CA Homes LLC, which owns
approximately 24.4% of the outstanding shares of CalAtlantic, has agreed to vote all its shares in favor of the proposal.

The Lennar stockholders are being asked to vote on proposals to (i) approve the issuance of the Class A and Class B common stock in the Merger,
and (ii) approve an amendment to Lennar’s certificate of incorporation increasing the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock to
400,000,000 shares from the 300,000,000 shares that are currently authorized. Without such an increase, the number of authorized but unissued shares of
Lennar Class A common stock would be insufficient to enable Lennar to issue all of the shares of Lennar Class A common stock it would be required to
issue in the Merger, if no CalAtlantic stockholders elect to receive cash in connection with the Merger. However, MP CA Homes, LLC has agreed that it
will be deemed to have elected to receive cash with regard to the number of shares equal to any difference between the maximum

Table of Contents

number of shares as to which CalAtlantic stockholders can make a cash election, and the number of shares as to which CalAtlantic stockholders elect to
receive cash in the Merger. Based on the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock outstanding on December 15, 2017, and taking account of the
fact that the merger consideration for 24,083,091 shares will be cash, Lennar would issue in the merger 81,508,215 shares of Class A common stock and
1,630,164 shares of Class B common stock. Lennar will also issue additional shares in the future as result of conversions of CalAtlantic convertible debt
securities and exercises of CalAtlantic options, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights.

The proposal to approve the issuance of Class A and Class B common stock in the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority in voting
power of the shares of Class A and Class B common stock that are voted at a meeting of Lennar stockholders at which a quorum is present (treating
abstentions as votes against), voting together as though they were a single class. The proposal to amend the certificate of incorporation to increase the
number of shares of Class A common stock that Lennar is authorized to issue requires (i) the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the
outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock, voting together as though they were a single class and (ii) a majority of the shares of Class A
common stock that are voted with regard to the proposal, in each case, at a meeting of Lennar stockholders at which a quorum is present. Stuart Miller,
the Chief Executive Officer and a director of Lennar, and entities owned by trusts of which Mr. Miller and members of his family are the beneficiaries,
which collectively have the right to cast approximately 39.0% of all the votes that can be cast by Lennar stockholders, have agreed to vote all their
shares in favor of both of the proposals (subject to certain exceptions described in the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus). However,
Mr. Miller and the entities owned by his family trusts own less than 1% of the outstanding Class A common stock, and therefore will not have a
substantial impact on the separate vote of the Class A stockholders.

It is very important that you vote your shares. With regard to CalAtlantic stockholders, the CalAtlantic board of directors unanimously
recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. With regard to Lennar stockholders, the Lennar board of
directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the issuance of shares in the Merger and “FOR” the proposal
to amend Lennar’s certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of Class A common stock that Lennar is authorized to issue.
Failure to vote will have the same effect as voting against the CalAtlantic proposal to adopt the merger agreement, and against the Lennar
proposal to amend its certificate of incorporation (with regard to the combined vote of the Lennar Class A and Class B common stock).

The accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus contains detailed information about the CalAtlantic and Lennar
stockholders meetings and about the matters to be voted upon at those meetings. You should read the joint proxy
statement/prospectus carefully, including the section captioned “Risk Factors” which begins on page 26, before you
vote.

We look forward to the exciting strategic combination of CalAtlantic and Lennar.

Sincerely,
 

Stuart Miller
Chief Executive Officer

Lennar Corporation   

Larry Nicholson
Chief Executive Officer and President

CalAtlantic Group, Inc.
 

 

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any other federal or state governmental agency has approved or disapproved the
Merger or the securities to be issued in connection with the Merger or determined whether the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus
is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary would be a criminal offense.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is dated January 4, 2018, and is first being mailed to CalAtlantic and Lennar stockholders on or about

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

The following questions and answers briefly address some likely questions about Lennar’s and CalAtlantic’s special meetings. Lennar and
CalAtlantic stockholders should carefully read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes and the other documents to which this
joint proxy statement/prospectus refers or which it incorporates by reference, because this section does not provide all the information that might be
important to you. Also see “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 133.

 
Q: Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus?
 

A: CalAtlantic and Lennar have agreed to a business combination pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement that is described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. A copy of the merger agreement is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in Annex A.

In order to complete the Merger, among other things:
 

 •  CalAtlantic stockholders must approve the adoption of the merger agreement; and
 

 
•  Lennar stockholders must approve the issuance of shares of Lennar’s Class A and Class B common stock in connection with the Merger and

might have to approve an amendment to Lennar’s certificate of incorporation increasing the number of shares of Class A common stock that
Lennar is authorized to issue.

CalAtlantic and Lennar will hold separate special meetings of their stockholders to obtain these approvals. This joint proxy statement/prospectus,
including its annexes, contains and incorporates by reference important information about CalAtlantic and Lennar, the Merger and the
stockholders meetings of CalAtlantic and Lennar. You should read all the available information carefully and in its entirety.

 
Q: What will happen in the Merger and what will CalAtlantic stockholders receive in the Merger?
 

A: In the Merger, CalAtlantic will be merged into Merger Sub, a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar, with Merger Sub surviving as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar. At the effective time of the Merger, each share of CalAtlantic common stock will become the right to receive
0.885 shares of Lennar Class A common stock and 0.0177 shares of Lennar Class B common stock. CalAtlantic stockholders will have the option
to receive cash in an amount equal to $48.26 per share of CalAtlantic common stock in lieu of receiving shares of Lennar Class A common stock
and Class B common stock in the Merger, subject to proration to the extent cash to be paid to all such holders who elect to receive cash would
exceed $1,162,250,000. No fractional shares of Lennar common stock will be issued in the Merger, and CalAtlantic stockholders will instead
receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Lennar common stock. The terms of the merger consideration are described in more detail in the section
of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “The Merger Agreement—Terms of the Merger” beginning on page 79.

 
Q: Will CalAtlantic stockholders who receive shares of Lennar Class A common stock in the Merger receive a Lennar Class B common stock

dividend?
 

A: On October 29, 2017, the Lennar board of directors, which we refer to as the “Lennar board” or “Lennar board of directors,” declared a stock
dividend of one share of Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A or Class B common stock held by Lennar stockholders, payable on
November 27, 2017 to holders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2017, which we refer to as the “Class B dividend.” Pursuant to
the merger agreement, to account for the Class B dividend, CalAtlantic stockholders entitled to receive Lennar Class A common stock as
consideration in the Merger will also be entitled to receive 0.0177 shares of Lennar Class B common stock for each share of CalAtlantic common
stock.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, except for the Class B dividend, Lennar is not permitted to pay any dividends or make any distributions
with a record date after the date of the merger agreement and prior

Table of Contents

to completion of the Merger, other than regular quarterly cash dividends in amounts consistent with past practice. CalAtlantic stockholders will
not be entitled to receive any cash dividends Lennar pays to holders of record on a date prior to the date of the Merger. After the closing of the
Merger, as a holder of shares of Lennar common stock, you will receive the same dividends on Lennar shares that all other holders of Lennar
shares might receive, provided that the dividend record date is after the Merger is completed.

 
Q: If a CalAtlantic stockholder makes a valid cash election, is that stockholder guaranteed to receive all cash in the Merger?
 

A: No. If a CalAtlantic stockholder elects to receive cash in the Merger, that stockholder is not guaranteed to receive cash for all the shares for which
the stockholder makes a valid cash election. Under the merger agreement, the aggregate cash consideration payable in the Merger is capped at
$1,162,250,000. If CalAtlantic stockholders elect to receive cash with respect to 24,083,092 or more shares of CalAtlantic common stock, the
aggregate cash consideration such stockholders elect to receive would exceed $1,162,250,000, in which case the cash paid to CalAtlantic
stockholders who validly elect to receive cash will be prorated so that the total cash that is paid will be $1,162,250,000, with the balance of the
merger consideration payable to such stockholders being paid in the form of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock. Accordingly, for
example:

 

 
•  if all the CalAtlantic stockholders elect to receive cash, each CalAtlantic stockholder will receive approximately 21.8% of its merger

consideration in cash and the remaining 78.2% in the form of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock; and
 

 

•  if holders of 50% of the outstanding CalAtlantic common stock elect to receive cash, each CalAtlantic stockholder who elects to receive
cash will receive approximately 43.6% of its merger consideration in cash and the remaining 56.4% in the form of Lennar Class A and
Class B common stock, and each CalAtlantic stockholder who does not elect to receive cash will receive its entire merger consideration in
the form of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock.

If no CalAtlantic stockholder elects to receive cash, all CalAtlantic stockholders, other than MP CA Homes LLC, which we refer to as “MP CA
Homes,” will receive their entire merger consideration in the form of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock, and MP CA Homes, which
owns approximately 24.4% of the outstanding CalAtlantic common stock, will be deemed to have elected to receive cash with respect to
24,083,091 of its 28,332,549 shares for an aggregate cash consideration of $1,162,250,000. See “The MP CA Homes Voting and Cash Election
Agreement” beginning on page 99 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: How does a CalAtlantic stockholder make a cash election?

Lennar will cause an election form, which a CalAtlantic stockholder can use to make a cash election, to be sent to each CalAtlantic stockholder of
record at least 20 business days before the deadline for electing to receive cash. The deadline for electing to receive cash will be 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern Time on the fifth business day before the scheduled date of the CalAtlantic special meeting. Lennar will also use commercially reasonable
efforts to make the election form available to all persons who become record holders of CalAtlantic common stock after the record date for the
mailing described above and prior to the election deadline.

An election will have been validly made only if Lennar’s distribution agent has received, by the election deadline, a validly completed and
executed election form (that is not otherwise withdrawn), accompanied by (1) CalAtlantic stock certificates, if any, to which such election form
relates, or (2) an agent’s message stating that such shares of CalAtlantic common stock have been transferred by book entry transfer to an account
established by Lennar’s distribution agent for the purpose of receiving shares of CalAtlantic common stock. After the election deadline, cash
elections will be irrevocable. For more information regarding the procedures for electing to receive cash, see the section titled, “The Merger
Agreement—Cash Election” on page 83 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Table of Contents

Q: Can CalAtlantic stockholders change or revoke their cash elections once they have mailed their signed cash election forms?
 

A: Yes. CalAtlantic stockholders can change or revoke their cash elections in writing at any time prior to the deadline for making cash elections,
which will be 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on the fifth business day before the scheduled date of the CalAtlantic special meeting. After such date,
CalAtlantic stockholders cannot change or revoke their cash elections.

 
Q: What happens if a CalAtlantic stockholder does not submit a validly completed cash election form and related materials or they are not

received by Lennar’s distribution agent before the election deadline?
 

A: For any shares of CalAtlantic common stock with respect to which the distribution agent does not receive a validly completed and timely election
form and any related materials, the holder of those shares will be deemed not to have made a valid cash election. Under the merger agreement, the
holders of such shares will receive shares of Lennar common stock in the Merger.

 
Q: What happens if the market price of shares of Lennar common stock or CalAtlantic common stock changes before the closing of the

Merger?
 

A: No change will be made to the ratio of 0.885 shares of Class A common stock and 0.0177 shares of Class B common stock per share of
CalAtlantic common stock, which is referred to as the “exchange ratio,” if the market price of shares of Lennar Class A or Class B common stock
or CalAtlantic common stock changes before the Merger. Because the exchange ratio is fixed, the value of the stock consideration to be received
in the Merger will fluctuate between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the completion of the Merger based upon the market
value of Lennar’s Class A and Class B common stock. However, the value of the stock consideration to be received in the Merger will not be
affected by fluctuations in the market price of CalAtlantic’s common stock.

 
Q: What is the market value of the Lennar stock that CalAtlantic stockholders will receive in the Merger?
 

A: The exact value of the shares of Lennar stock that CalAtlantic stockholders will receive in the Merger will depend on the price of shares of Lennar
Class A and Class B common stock at the effective time of the Merger. The price at the effective time of the Merger will not be known at the
deadline for submitting a cash election form, or at the time of the CalAtlantic special meeting. Based on the closing price of Lennar’s stock on the
NYSE on October 27, 2017, the last full trading day before the public announcement of the Merger, of $58.01 for its Class A common stock, 0.885
shares of Lennar Class A common stock had a value of $51.34. Based on the closing price of Lennar’s stock on the NYSE on January 2, 2018, the
latest practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, of $64.84 for its Class A common stock and $52.61 for its
Class B common stock, 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A common stock had a value of $57.38 and 0.0177 shares of Lennar Class B common stock
had a value of $0.93. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for Lennar’s Class A and Class B common stock when you are ready to
make a decision on whether or not to make a cash election and your voting decision.

 
Q: How will Lennar stockholders be affected by the Merger and the issuance of shares of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock to

CalAtlantic stockholders in the Merger?
 

A: After the Merger, each Lennar stockholder will continue to hold the same number of shares of Lennar common stock of each class that the Lennar
stockholder held immediately prior to the Merger. However, because Lennar will be issuing shares of Class A and Class B common stock to
CalAtlantic stockholders in the Merger, each share of Lennar stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger will, after the

Merger, represent a smaller percentage of the combined company’s stock than it did of Lennar’s stock before the Merger. Upon the completion of
the Merger, based on the number of shares of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock and CalAtlantic common stock outstanding as of January
2, 2018, the latest practicable trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, continuing Lennar Class A stockholders and
Class B stockholders together will own approximately 74% of the outstanding stock of the combined company, and former CalAtlantic
stockholders will own approximately 26% of the outstanding stock of the combined company, assuming CalAtlantic stockholders will elect or will
be deemed to elect to receive cash with regard to the number of shares that will cause the total cash consideration paid by Lennar in the Merger to
be $1,162,250,000.

 
Q: What am I being asked to vote on and why is this approval necessary?
 

A: CalAtlantic. CalAtlantic stockholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
 

 
•  CalAtlantic Merger Proposal: To consider and vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, a copy of which is included as Annex A

to this joint proxy statement/prospectus;
 

 
•  CalAtlantic Merger-Related Compensation Proposal: To consider and vote on the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis,

specified compensatory arrangements between CalAtlantic and its named executive officers relating to the proposed Merger, as described in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus; and

 

 
•  CalAtlantic Adjournment Proposal: To vote upon one or more proposals to adjourn the CalAtlantic special meeting, if necessary or

appropriate, including any adjournment to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the foregoing proposals.

CalAtlantic stockholders will also be asked to transact such other business as may validly come before the special meeting and any postponement
or adjournment thereof. Approval of the CalAtlantic Merger Proposal by CalAtlantic stockholders is required for completion of the
Merger.

Lennar. Lennar stockholders are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 

 
•  Lennar Merger Proposal: A proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Lennar’s Class A and Class B common stock in connection with

the Merger as contemplated by the merger agreement;
 

 
•  Lennar Authorized Share Proposal: A proposal to approve an amendment to Lennar’s Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of

shares of Class A common stock that Lennar is authorized to issue from 300,000,000 shares to 400,000,000 shares; and
 

 
•  Lennar Adjournment Proposal: A proposal to approve the adjournment of the Lennar special meeting, if necessary in order to enable

Lennar to solicit additional votes, if at the time of the stockholders meeting there are not sufficient votes to approve the Lennar Merger
Proposal and the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal.

Approval of the Lennar Merger Proposal by Lennar is required for completion of the Merger. It is very likely that Lennar will be able to
complete the Merger without approval of the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal. If the number of shares of Class A common stock that Lennar is
required to issue in the Merger exceeds the number of shares of Class A common stock that Lennar currently is authorized to issue (which would
be the case if no CalAtlantic stockholders exercise the cash election option under the merger agreement), approval of the Lennar Authorized Share
Proposal would be required for completion of the Merger. However, there is an agreement with a major CalAtlantic stockholder assuring that the
cash election will be exercised with respect to the maximum number of shares as to which it can be exercised, and therefore Lennar should be able
to complete the Merger even if the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal is not approved. See “The MP CA Homes Voting and Cash Election
Agreement.” If Lennar will have enough authorized shares of Class A common stock to complete the Merger even if the Lennar Authorized Share
Proposal is not approved, Lennar will complete the Merger whether or not the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal is approved.

Table of Contents

Q: What constitutes a quorum?
 

A: CalAtlantic. Stockholders who are record holders of shares representing at least a majority in voting interest of the shares of CalAtlantic common
stock entitled to vote at the CalAtlantic special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business at the CalAtlantic special meeting. Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of CalAtlantic
common stock represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved. However, failures to vote and
broker non-votes will not be included in the calculation of the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock represented at the special meeting
for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.

Lennar. The presence in person or by proxy of holders of a majority in voting power, and not less than one-third in number, of the shares entitled
to vote at the Lennar stockholders meeting will be necessary, and will constitute a quorum, for the transaction of business at that meeting. Shares
that are present but abstain from voting will be treated as present for the purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, even though they will
not be voted (except that they will be treated as negative votes with regard to the Lennar Merger Proposal). Any shares that are not able to be
voted, such as shares held by brokers or other fiduciaries who do not receive necessary voting instructions from beneficial owners (so-called
broker non-votes) will not be counted as present for purposes of the quorum determination.

 
Q: How does the CalAtlantic board of directors recommend that I vote?
 

A: The CalAtlantic board of directors, which we refer to as the “CalAtlantic board” or the “CalAtlantic board of directors,” unanimously recommends
that CalAtlantic stockholders vote “FOR” the CalAtlantic Merger Proposal, “FOR” the CalAtlantic Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and
“FOR” the CalAtlantic Adjournment Proposal, if necessary.

 
Q: How does the Lennar board of directors recommend that I vote?
 

A: The Lennar board of directors unanimously recommends that Lennar stockholders vote “FOR” the Lennar Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Lennar
Authorized Share Proposal and “FOR” the Lennar Adjournment Proposal, if necessary.

 
Q: When do Lennar and CalAtlantic expect to complete the Merger?
 

A: The Merger is expected to take place in the first quarter of 2018. However, it is possible the Merger will be delayed because of conditions beyond
the control of either CalAtlantic or Lennar. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 84.

 
Q: What will happen if the Merger is not completed?
 

A: If CalAtlantic or Lennar does not receive the requisite stockholder votes or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, CalAtlantic
stockholders will not receive any merger consideration and will continue to hold shares of CalAtlantic common stock. If the merger agreement is
terminated because the CalAtlantic board of directors withdraws or negatively modifies its recommendation that CalAtlantic stockholders give the
approval that is necessary for the Merger to take place, or if it is terminated by CalAtlantic in order to accept what its board of directors
determines to be a superior proposal that Lennar will not at least match, CalAtlantic will be required to pay Lennar a termination fee of
$178.7 million. Similarly, if the merger agreement is terminated because the Lennar board of directors withdraws or negatively modifies its
recommendation that Lennar stockholders give the approval or approvals that are necessary for the Merger to take place, Lennar will be required
to pay CalAtlantic a termination fee of $178.7 million. If the Merger does not take place because the stockholders of either CalAtlantic or Lennar
fail to give the necessary stockholder approvals, the company whose stockholders do not give the necessary stockholder approvals

will have to reimburse the other company for its Merger related expenses up to $30.0 million. See “The Merger Agreement—Effect of
Termination” and “—Termination Fees; Expense Reimbursement” beginning on pages 96, respectively.

 
Q: What do I need to do now? Do I need to do anything with my shares of common stock other than voting for the proposals at the special

meeting and submitting a cash election form, if applicable?
 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please submit a proxy or voting
instructions for your shares by following the instructions set forth on the proxy card or on the voting instruction form provided by the record
holder if your shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee.

If you are a CalAtlantic stockholder who does not make a valid cash election, shortly after the effective time of the Merger, you will receive
instructions regarding submitting your CalAtlantic shares in order to receive the Lennar Class A and Class B common stock to which you are
entitled as a result of the Merger. Please do not send your CalAtlantic stock certificates with your proxy card.

 
Q: How do I vote?
 

A: If you are a stockholder of record of CalAtlantic as of January 4, 2018 or if you are a stockholder of record of Lennar as of January 4, 2018, you
may vote by proxy before the CalAtlantic or Lennar special meeting, as applicable, in one of the following ways:

 

 •  By Telephone: By dialing the toll-free number specified on the proxy card and following the instructions on the proxy card;
 

 •  Via the Internet: By accessing the website specified on the proxy card and following the instructions on the proxy card; or
 

 
•  By Mail: By completing and returning the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. The envelope requires no additional postage if mailed in the

United States.

You may also cast your vote in person at the CalAtlantic or Lennar special meeting, as applicable.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a broker or other nominee, that institution will send you separate instructions describing the
procedure that you must follow in order to have your shares voted.

 
Q: When and where will the special stockholders meetings be held?
 

A: CalAtlantic. The CalAtlantic special meeting will be held at CalAtlantic’s primary California office at 15360 Barranca Parkway, Irvine, CA
92618, on February 12, 2018 at 9:30 a.m., Pacific time.

Lennar. The Lennar special meeting will be held at Lennar’s offices at 700 Northwest 107th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33172 on February 12, 2018
at 11:00 a.m., Eastern time.

 
Q: If my shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee, will my broker, bank or other nominee vote my shares for me?
 

A: Not unless you instruct them to do so. If your shares are held in “street name” in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are
considered the “beneficial holder” of the shares held for you in what is known as “street name.” You are not the “record holder” of such shares. If
this is the case, this joint proxy statement/prospectus has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. As the beneficial holder,
you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank or other nominee should
provide you with instructions as to how to do this.

Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to CalAtlantic or Lennar, as applicable, or by
voting in person at the CalAtlantic special meeting or the Lennar

special meeting, as applicable, unless you provide a “legal proxy” from your broker, bank or other nominee that authorizes you to vote.

If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker or other nominee, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which your broker or
other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote. In this joint proxy statement/prospectus, we refer to a failure of a broker or other
nominee to vote shares because it did not receive a voting instruction from the beneficial owner of the shares as a “broker non-vote.” Under the
current NYSE rules, brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the proposals that will be voted on at the CalAtlantic or Lennar
special meeting. A broker non-vote of a share of CalAtlantic common stock will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the CalAtlantic
Merger Proposal; it will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the CalAtlantic Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the CalAtlantic
Adjournment Proposal. A broker non-vote of a share of Lennar stock will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Lennar Authorized
Share Proposal with respect to the combined vote of the Class A and Class B common stock; it will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on
the Lennar Merger Proposal, the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal with respect to the separate vote of holders of Class A common stock, or the
Lennar Adjournment Proposal.

 
Q: What happens if I abstain from voting with regard to a proposal?
 

A: For purposes of the CalAtlantic or Lennar special meeting, an abstention occurs when a stockholder who has not submitted a proxy attends the
special meeting in person but does not vote or a stockholder returns a proxy marked with an “abstain” designation. Please note that a proxy that is
signed and returned but is not marked as to how it should be voted will be voted “FOR” the proposals that are voted upon at the applicable special
meeting of stockholders.

CalAtlantic. If you are a CalAtlantic stockholder and you abstain from voting, that will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
CalAtlantic Merger Proposal, the CalAtlantic Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and the CalAtlantic Adjournment Proposal.

Lennar. If you are a Lennar stockholder and you abstain from voting, that will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Lennar Merger
Proposal and the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal with respect to the combined vote of the Class A and Class B common stock; it will have no
effect on the outcome of the vote on the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal with respect to the separate vote of holders of Lennar’s Class A
common stock and no effect on the outcome of the vote on the Lennar Adjournment Proposal.

 
Q: What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?
 

A: If you validly complete, sign and return your proxy card without indicating how to vote on any particular proposal, the CalAtlantic common stock
or the Lennar Class A or Class B common stock represented by your proxy will be voted as recommended by the CalAtlantic board or the Lennar
board, as the case may be, with respect to that proposal. That means that a signed proxy card that does not indicate how to vote will be voted
“FOR” all the proposals.

 
Q: May I change or revoke my proxy after I have delivered it?
 

A: Yes. You may revoke or change your proxy with regard to a matter any time before the matter is voted upon at the CalAtlantic or Lennar special
meeting. You can do this by:

 

 

•  sending a written notice, which is received prior to your vote being cast with regard to the matter, if the matter will be voted upon at the
CalAtlantic special meeting, to CalAtlantic Group, Inc., 15360 Barranca Parkway, Irvine, California 92618, Attention: Corporate Secretary,
or if the matter will be voted upon at the Lennar special meeting, to Lennar Corporation, 700 Northwest 107th Avenue, Miami, Florida
33172, Attention: Corporate Secretary, in each case that bears a date later than the date of the prior proxy and states that you revoke your
prior proxy with regard to the specified matter (or in its entirety);

Table of Contents

 
•  submitting a valid, later-dated proxy by mail, telephone or via the Internet that is received prior to your vote being cast with regard to the

matter at the CalAtlantic or Lennar special meeting, as the case may be (provided that any such submission must comply with the applicable
instructions, including any cut-off times for when proxies can be submitted via the Internet); or

 

 
•  attending the CalAtlantic or Lennar special meeting, as the case may be, and voting by ballot in person with regard to the matter. Your

attendance at the CalAtlantic or Lennar special meeting, as the case may be, will not, by itself, revoke any proxy that you have previously
given.

If you hold your shares of CalAtlantic common stock or Lennar stock through a broker or other nominee, you must follow the directions you
receive from your broker or other nominee in order to revoke or change your voting instructions.

 
Q: What if I hold shares of capital stock in both CalAtlantic and Lennar?
 

A: If you are a stockholder of both CalAtlantic and Lennar, you will receive two separate packages of proxy materials. A vote cast as a CalAtlantic
stockholder will not count as a vote cast as a Lennar stockholder, and a vote cast as a Lennar stockholder will not count as a vote cast as a
CalAtlantic stockholder. Therefore, please separately submit a proxy for each of your CalAtlantic and Lennar shares.

 
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the CalAtlantic or Lennar special meeting?
 

A: The preliminary voting results will be announced at each of the CalAtlantic special meeting and Lennar special meeting. In addition, within four
business days after the date of the special meeting, each of CalAtlantic and Lennar intends to report the final voting results in a Current Report on
Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

 
Q: What happens if I sell my shares of CalAtlantic common stock or Lennar stock after the record date but before the CalAtlantic or Lennar

special meeting, as the case may be?
 

A: The record date for the CalAtlantic special meeting is earlier than the date of the CalAtlantic special meeting and the record date for the Lennar
special meeting is earlier than the date of the Lennar special meeting, and, in each case, earlier than the date that the Merger is expected to be
completed. If you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of CalAtlantic common stock or Lennar stock after the applicable record date but before
the date of the applicable special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at that special meeting. However, if you are a CalAtlantic stockholder,
you will not have the right to receive the merger consideration to be received by CalAtlantic stockholders in the Merger. In order to receive the
merger consideration, you must hold your shares of CalAtlantic common stock at the time of the completion of the Merger.

 
Q: What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card or vote instruction card?
 

A: Your receipt of more than one proxy card or vote instruction card may mean that you have multiple accounts with CalAtlantic’s or Lennar’s
transfer agent or with a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee. If you vote by mail, you will need to sign and return all the proxy cards or vote
instruction cards to cause all of your shares of CalAtlantic common stock or Lennar Class A or Class B common stock, as applicable, to be voted.
Each proxy card or vote instruction card relates to a distinct number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock or Lennar Class A or Class B common
stock, and it is the only means by which those particular shares of CalAtlantic stock or Lennar stock can be voted by mail.

Q: What are the tax consequences of the Merger?
 

A: The Merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization pursuant to section 368(a) of the Code and, in connection with the filing of the registration
statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, CalAtlantic has received an opinion from tax counsel concluding that it will so
qualify. Based on that opinion, in the Merger, a CalAtlantic stockholder generally:

 

 •  will not recognize gain or loss as a result of receiving solely Lennar common stock as merger consideration;
 

 
•  will recognize gain (but not loss) as a result of receiving partly cash and partly Lennar common stock with respect to the holder’s

CalAtlantic common stock in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) any gain realized with respect to that stock or (ii) the amount of any cash
received with respect to that stock (other than any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Lennar common stock);

 

 
•  will recognize gain or loss as a result of receiving cash with respect to all the holder’s CalAtlantic common stock in an amount equal to the

difference between the holder’s basis in the CalAtlantic common stock and the total amount of cash received as a result of the Merger; and
 

 
•  will recognize gain (or loss) to the extent any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Lennar common stock exceeds (or is less than) the

basis of the fractional share.

Tax matters are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the Merger to a particular CalAtlantic stockholder will depend on that
stockholder’s circumstances. Accordingly, CalAtlantic and Lennar urge you to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the
Merger to you, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income and other tax laws. For a more complete
discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, see “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” beginning
on page 75.

 
Q: Am I entitled to dissenter or appraisal rights?
 

A: No. Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and
demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the
consideration being paid or issued in connection with that extraordinary transaction. Appraisal rights are not available in all circumstances, and
exceptions to these rights are provided under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which we refer to as the “DGCL.” In the
Merger, because CalAtlantic stockholders are not required to accept in the Merger any consideration in exchange for their shares of CalAtlantic
common stock other than Lennar Class A common stock and Class B common stock, both of which are listed on the NYSE, and cash in lieu of
fractional shares (if applicable), holders of CalAtlantic common stock will not be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger with
respect to their shares of CalAtlantic common stock. For a more detailed description of the relevant provisions of the DGCL, see the section
entitled “The Merger—No Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 68.

 
Q: Whom should I contact if I have any questions about the proxy materials or voting?
 

A: If you have any questions about the Merger or the other matters to be voted upon at the CalAtlantic or Lennar special meeting, or if you need
assistance submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy
card, you should contact Georgeson LLC, CalAtlantic’s proxy solicitor, toll-free at (877) 507-1756, if you are a CalAtlantic stockholder, or
MacKenzie Partners, Inc., Lennar’s proxy solicitor, toll-free at (800) 322-2885 (banks and brokers call collect at (212) 929-5500), if you are a
Lennar stockholder.

Table of Contents

Lennar has two classes of common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Both classes are listed on the NYSE, with the
symbols LEN and LEN.B, respectively. The two classes are substantially identical in all respects, except that the holders of the Class A common
stock, which we refer to as the “Lennar Class A stockholders,” are entitled to one vote per share and the holders of the Class B common stock,
which we refer to as the “Lennar Class B stockholders,” and together with the Lennar Class A stockholders, the “Lennar stockholders,” are entitled
to 10 votes per share. The trading price of the Class A common stock usually is higher than the trading price of the Class B common stock. Based
on the outstanding shares of Lennar and CalAtlantic stock on January 4, 2018, the Lennar shares that are issued to CalAtlantic stockholders in the
Merger will constitute approximately 26% of the Lennar shares of both classes that will be outstanding immediately following the Merger.

Information About CalAtlantic (See Page 103)

CalAtlantic Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. CalAtlantic builds homes across the homebuilding
spectrum, from entry level to luxury, in over 40 metropolitan statistical areas spanning 17 states. Also providing mortgage, title and escrow
services, CalAtlantic is focused on providing an exceptional end-to-end home buying experience for its customers.

CalAtlantic’s executive offices are located at 1100 Wilson Boulevard, #2100, Arlington, Virginia 22209 and its telephone number is
(240) 532-3806. Shares of CalAtlantic common stock are listed on the NYSE and trade under the symbol “CAA.”

This joint proxy statement/prospectus incorporates important business and financial information about CalAtlantic from other documents that
are incorporated by reference; see the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 133.

Information About Merger Sub (See Page 105)

Cheetah Cub Group Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar, is a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of being a party to the
Merger. In the Merger, CalAtlantic will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity and continuing to be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar. Merger Sub has not conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters
contemplated by the merger agreement.

The Merger (See Page 38)

Subject to the terms and conditions in the merger agreement, in the Merger, CalAtlantic will be merged with and into Merger Sub, which is
the entity that will survive the Merger and will succeed to all the assets and liabilities, and all the rights and privileges, of CalAtlantic, will be
renamed “CalAtlantic Group, Inc.” as a result of the Merger.

Terms of the Merger; Exchange and Payment Procedures (See Page 79, 80)

In the Merger, each share of CalAtlantic common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger
(other than shares of CalAtlantic common stock held in the treasury of CalAtlantic or held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
CalAtlantic, and shares of CalAtlantic common stock held by Lennar or Merger Sub, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger) will
automatically be converted into the right to receive 0.885 shares of Class A common stock of Lennar and 0.0177 shares of Class B common stock
of Lennar. CalAtlantic stockholders will have the option to elect to receive $48.26 per share in cash, without interest, for each share of CalAtlantic
common stock in lieu of receiving Lennar

Table of Contents

Class A and Class B common stock, subject to a maximum cash amount described below under “—Cash Election.” Any shares of CalAtlantic
common stock owned directly or indirectly by CalAtlantic, Lennar or Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than
those held in a fiduciary capacity) will be cancelled and the holders of those shares will receive no merger consideration. No fractional shares of
Lennar common stock will be issued in connection with the Merger. CalAtlantic stockholders will receive, in lieu of fractional shares of Lennar
common stock, cash equal to the applicable fraction of the market value of a full share of the applicable Lennar common stock (based on the last
sale price reported on the NYSE) on the last trading day before the date on which the Merger is effective. For a more complete description of the
merger consideration, see “The Merger Agreement—Terms of the Merger” beginning on page 79.

Promptly after the effective time of the Merger (but in no event later than two business days after the date on which the effective time
occurs), the distribution agent appointed by Lennar will mail or arrange for the electronic delivery to CalAtlantic stockholders of a letter of
transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of CalAtlantic common stock (including stock certificates with regard to any stock
held in certificated form) in order to receive Lennar stock as a result of the Merger. Not more than two business days after the date on which the
effective time of the Merger occurs, Lennar will deliver the cash consideration to the distribution agent, and the distribution agent will promptly
thereafter distribute the cash consideration to the holders of CalAtlantic common stock entitled to receive the cash consideration.

Cash Election (See Page 83)

Each person who is a record owner of CalAtlantic common stock at any time between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
the fifth business day before the scheduled date of the CalAtlantic stockholders meeting will have the option to elect to receive $48.26 per
CalAtlantic share in cash instead of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock with regard to some or all of the person’s CalAtlantic common
stock. The number of CalAtlantic shares with regard to which Lennar will pay cash to a CalAtlantic stockholder who makes a cash election will be
subject to proration to the extent the total amount of cash that Lennar would have to pay for all the CalAtlantic shares that are the subject of cash
elections would exceed $1,162,250,000 (i.e., to the extent cash elections are made with regard to more than 24,083,091 shares of CalAtlantic’s
common stock). MP CA Homes has agreed that if CalAtlantic stockholders (which may include MP CA Homes) do not elect to receive cash
consideration with respect to the maximum number of shares as to which Lennar has agreed to pay cash, MP CA Homes will be deemed to have
made a cash election with regard to the number of its CalAtlantic shares that would cause cash elections to be made with regard to that maximum
number of CalAtlantic shares. For a more complete description of the MP CA Homes voting and cash election agreement, see “The MP CA Homes
Voting and Cash Election Agreement—Provision Relating to Cash Election” beginning on page 99.

Lennar will cause the distribution agent to transmit a cash election form to each holder of record of CalAtlantic common stock as of the most
recent practicable date prior to such mailing which will enable a record holder to specify the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock, if any,
as to which the record holder elects to exercise the cash election option. In order to properly exercise the cash election option, a record holder of
CalAtlantic common stock must timely return a completed and signed cash election form, together with the stock certificate evidencing the shares
of CalAtlantic common stock as to which the cash election option is being exercised or an agent’s message stating that such shares of common
stock have been transferred by book entry transfer to an account established by the distribution agent. YOU WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE CASH ELECTION UNLESS YOU PROPERLY COMPLETE AND RETURN, AND DO NOT WITHDRAW, A CASH
ELECTION FORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND IN THE CASH
ELECTION FORM. YOU WILL RECEIVE LENNAR COMMON STOCK AS MERGER CONSIDERATION WITH RESPECT TO EACH
SHARE OF CALATLANTIC STOCK FOR WHICH YOU DO NOT MAKE A VALID CASH ELECTION. A HOLDER OF SHARES OF
CALATLANTIC COMMON STOCK WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE OR

WITHDRAW A CASH ELECTION AT ANY TIME BEFORE THE ELECTION DEADLINE, BUT NOT AFTER THE ELECTION DEADLINE,
IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THE CASH ELECTION FORM. IF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS
TERMINATED WITHOUT THE MERGER TAKING PLACE, ALL CASH ELECTIONS WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE DEEMED REVOKED.

Financing Related to the Merger (See Page 83)

Although the Merger is not conditioned upon Lennar having received any financing, in anticipation of the payments Lennar will be making as
a result of exercises of the cash election option, Lennar sold $300 million of 2.95% Senior Notes due 2020 and $900 million of 4.75% Senior Notes
due 2027, in a private offering, which we refer to as the “Senior Notes Offering” that closed on November 29, 2017. Lennar intends to use the net
proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering to fund the cash consideration payable to CalAtlantic stockholders who elect to receive cash in the
Merger, to pay expenses related to the Merger and for general corporate purposes.

Treatment of CalAtlantic Equity Awards (See Page 81)

Treatment of Stock Options

At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of CalAtlantic common stock will automatically convert into
an option to acquire Lennar Class A and Class B common stock on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such CalAtlantic option
immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger as follows (i) the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock to which the option related
immediately prior to the effective time will be multiplied by (ii) 0.885 (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Lennar Class A
common stock), plus one share of Lennar Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A common stock, subject to the terms of the option
(including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration or other deemed satisfaction thereof
pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant CalAtlantic equity plans or applicable award agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement). The exercise price of each outstanding option will be based on the exercise price of the CalAtlantic option per share of
CalAtlantic common stock as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, the exchange ratio of 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A
common stock for each share of CalAtlantic common stock and equitable and proportionate adjustments taking into account a November 2017
Lennar Class B stock dividend. At or prior to the effective time of the Merger, Lennar will file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Lennar common stock subject to such options, and it will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such options remain outstanding.

If the employment of a holder of a CalAtlantic stock option is terminated, other than for “cause,” on or prior to first anniversary of the
effective time of the Merger, any assumed and outstanding stock options held by such individual will become fully vested upon such termination of
employment.

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units.

At the effective time of the Merger, each time-based or performance-based restricted stock unit, or RSU, award granted under any of the
CalAtlantic equity plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into a right to receive shares of
Lennar common stock, on the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into
account any acceleration or other deemed satisfaction thereof pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant CalAtlantic equity plans or applicable
award agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) as were applicable under such RSUs as of immediately prior
to the consummation of the Merger. The number of shares subject to the RSU will be equal to (i) the number of shares of CalAtlantic common
stock subject to the

restricted stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger multiplied by (ii) 0.885 (rounded down if necessary), plus one share of Lennar
Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A common stock, subject to possible adjustment as provided in the merger agreement. All
performance-based vesting criteria to which any outstanding CalAtlantic RSUs are subject for which the performance period is not completed as of
the effective time of the Merger will be deemed achieved at the target performance level. At or prior to the effective time of the Merger, Lennar will
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Lennar common stock subject
to such RSUs and performance share units, or PSUs, and it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such RSUs remain outstanding.

If the employment of a holder of a CalAtlantic RSU is terminated, other than for “cause,” on or prior to first anniversary of the effective time,
any assumed and outstanding RSUs held by such individual will become fully vested upon such termination of employment.

Treatment of Stock Appreciation Rights.

At the effective time of the Merger, each stock appreciation right, or SAR, based on shares of CalAtlantic common stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will automatically convert into a right based on the shares of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock, on
the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration thereof
pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant CalAtlantic equity plans or applicable award agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement) as were applicable as of immediately prior to the effective time, subject to adjustment as provided in the merger agreement.
Each SAR will convert into (i) the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock to which the SAR related immediately prior to the effective time
multiplied by (ii) 0.885 (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Lennar Class A common stock), plus one share of Lennar
Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A common stock. The exercise price of each outstanding SAR will be based on the exercise
price per share of CalAtlantic common stock as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, the exchange ratio of 0.885 shares of
Lennar Class A common stock for each share of CalAtlantic common stock, and equitable and proportionate adjustments taking into account the
Class B dividend. If the holders of SARs are entitled to receive shares of Lennar Class A common stock on exercise of the SARs, at or prior to the
effective time of the Merger, Lennar will file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the
shares of Lennar common stock subject to such SARs, and it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as the SARs remain outstanding.

If the employment of a holder of a CalAtlantic SAR is terminated, other than for “cause,” on or prior to first anniversary of the effective time
of the Merger, any assumed and outstanding SARs held by such individual will become fully vested upon such termination of employment.

Awards” beginning on page 81. For further discussion of the treatment of CalAtlantic equity-based awards held by certain CalAtlantic directors and
executive officers, see “The Merger—Interests of CalAtlantic Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 68.

Treatment of CalAtlantic Convertible Debt (See Page 81)

Upon conversion of CalAtlantic convertible debt after the Merger, the holder will be entitled to receive with regard to each share of
CalAtlantic common stock the holder would have received if the conversion had taken place immediately before the effective time of the Merger,
the same consideration per share that is received by CalAtlantic stockholders who elect to receive cash, which may be wholly or primarily cash of
$48.26 per share.

Table of Contents

However, Lennar intends to offer holders of CalAtlantic convertible debt for a limited period of time after the Merger takes place the option of
electing to receive on conversion the same combination of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock and cash that is received in total by all
holders of CalAtlantic stock. Based on the CalAtlantic common stock that was outstanding on January 4, 2018, this would be approximately 79%
Lennar Class A and Class B common stock and 21% cash.

Board of Directors and Executive Officers After Completion of the Merger (See Page 67)

Upon completion of the Merger, the current members of the Lennar board of directors will continue to be directors of Lennar. They are Irving
Bolotin, Steven L. Gerard, Theron I. (“Tig”) Gilliam, Sherrill W. Hudson, Sidney Lapidus, Teri McClure, Stuart Miller, Armando Olivera, Donna
Shalala and Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. Lennar has agreed that immediately following the effective time of the Merger, Scott Stowell, who currently is the
Executive Chairman of CalAtlantic’s board of directors, will be elected to serve on the Lennar board of directors, assuming Mr. Stowell is able to
serve.

For more information about the directors and executive officers of Lennar after the Merger, see “The Merger—Board of Directors and
Executive Officers After Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 67.

CalAtlantic Board Recommendation and Its Reasons for the Merger (See Page 54)

After careful consideration, the CalAtlantic board of directors recommends that CalAtlantic stockholders vote “FOR” each proposal being
submitted to a vote of CalAtlantic stockholders at the CalAtlantic special meeting.

In the course of reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the
CalAtlantic board of directors considered a number of factors. For a more complete discussion of these factors, see “The Merger—CalAtlantic
Board Recommendation and Its Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 54.

Opinion of CalAtlantic’s Financial Advisor (See Page 57)

CalAtlantic retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, which we refer to as “J.P. Morgan,” to act as financial advisor to the CalAtlantic board of
directors in connection with the proposed Merger. At the meeting of the CalAtlantic board of directors on October 29, 2017, J.P. Morgan rendered
its oral opinion to the CalAtlantic board of directors that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, the consideration to be paid to the
holders of the CalAtlantic common stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. J.P. Morgan
confirmed this oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the CalAtlantic board of directors, dated October 29, 2017.

The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated October 29, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, is attached as Annex C to
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. CalAtlantic stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its
entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the CalAtlantic board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and
for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the consideration to be paid in the proposed Merger and did
not address any other aspect of the proposed Merger. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of CalAtlantic
as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter. For a description of the opinion that the
CalAtlantic board of directors received from J.P. Morgan, see “The Merger—Opinion of CalAtlantic’s Financial Advisor” beginning on
page 57 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Table of Contents

Interests of CalAtlantic Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (See Page 68)

Directors and executive officers of CalAtlantic have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from or in addition to the general
interests of CalAtlantic stockholders. These interests include, among others, potential severance benefits and other payments, the treatment of
outstanding equity awards pursuant to their severance and change in control agreements, certain retention bonuses if they remain employed by
CalAtlantic at the effective time of the Merger (subject to limited exceptions), and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage. The
CalAtlantic board of directors was aware of and considered those interests, among other matters, in reaching its decision to (i) approve the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) adopt, approve and declare advisable the merger agreement, and (iii) resolve
to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement to CalAtlantic stockholders. See the section entitled “Interests of CalAtlantic’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Mergers” for a more detailed description of these interests.

At the close of business on January 4, 2018 (the record date for determining the CalAtlantic stockholders who are entitled to vote at the
meeting), the number of outstanding CalAtlantic shares entitled to vote held by CalAtlantic’s directors, executive officers and their affiliates was
30,586,507 shares (including the shares held by MP CA Homes), which represented approximately 26.2% of the total voting power of the shares of
CalAtlantic common stock outstanding on that date. Approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding CalAtlantic shares entitled to vote thereon.

Voting Agreements (See Pages 98 and 99)

MP CA Homes, which owns approximately 24.3% of the outstanding CalAtlantic common stock, has agreed to vote all those shares in favor
of adopting the merger agreement and approving any other Merger-related matters presented for a vote of the CalAtlantic stockholders. MP CA
Homes has also agreed to vote those shares, and any other shares of CalAtlantic common stock that MP CA Homes owns or has the power to vote,
against any transaction that would prevent or materially delay the Merger or deprive Merger Sub or Lennar of the material benefits of the Merger.

Stuart Miller, certain entities owned by trusts of which Mr. Miller and members of his family are the beneficiaries, which entities and trusts
are referred to as the “Miller entities” and which collectively own Lennar stock that entitles them to cast approximately 39.0% of the votes that can
be cast by all the Lennar stockholders (but only 0.73% of the votes that can be cast by holders of Class A common stock voting as a separate class),
have agreed to vote all the shares of Lennar stock that they own or have the power to vote in favor of both of the Merger-related proposals that will
be presented to the Lennar stockholders. Mr. Miller and the Miller entities have also agreed to vote those shares against any transaction that would
prevent or materially delay the Merger.

If the Lennar board of directors changes its recommendation that Lennar’s stockholders vote in favor of the two Merger-related proposals,
Mr. Miller and the Miller entities will be required to vote all of their shares of Class A common stock, but will only be required to vote shares of
Class B common stock representing 30% of the outstanding Class B common stock (and, therefore, approximately 19.2% in voting power of the
Class A and Class B common stock voting together), in favor of the proposals. They will be free to vote the remainder of the shares in their
discretion.

Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations (See Page 75)

The Merger is intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and, in connection with the filing of
the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, CalAtlantic’s tax counsel, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, which
we refer to as Gibson Dunn, has rendered its tax opinion to CalAtlantic. It is the opinion of Gibson Dunn that subject to the qualifications and
assumptions described in the section captioned “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” below, the Merger will

Table of Contents

qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Based on that opinion, in the Merger, a CalAtlantic stockholder
generally:
 

 •  will not recognize gain or loss as a result of receiving solely Lennar common stock as Merger consideration;
 

 
•  will recognize gain (but not loss) as a result of receiving partly cash and partly Lennar common stock with respect to the holder’s

CalAtlantic common stock in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) any gain realized with respect to that stock or (ii) the amount of any
cash received with respect to that stock (other than any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Lennar common stock);

 

 
•  will recognize gain or loss as a result of receiving solely cash with respect to all the holder’s CalAtlantic common stock in an amount

equal to the difference between the holder’s basis in the CalAtlantic common stock and the total amount of cash received as a result of
the Merger; and

 

 
•  will recognize gain (or loss) to the extent any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Lennar common stock exceeds (or is less

than) the basis of the fractional share.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger (See Page 67)

The Merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of CalAtlantic by Lennar under the acquisition method of accounting according to U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, which we refer to as “GAAP.”

For a more complete description of the accounting treatment of the Merger, see “The Merger—Accounting Treatment of the Merger”
beginning on page 67.

No Appraisal Rights (See Page 68)

Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and
to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the
consideration being paid or issued to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the DGCL, neither CalAtlantic
stockholders nor Lennar stockholders will have appraisal or dissenters’ rights as a result of the Merger.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (See Page 67)

Lennar and CalAtlantic have determined that no authorizations, approvals or consents from regulatory authorities are required to enable them
to complete the Merger. For a more complete discussion of regulatory matters relating to the Merger, see “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals
Required for the Merger beginning on page 67.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (See Page 84)

The parties expect to complete the Merger after all of the conditions in the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, including the receipt of
stockholder approvals by CalAtlantic at the CalAtlantic special meeting and Lennar at the Lennar special meeting. However, it is possible that
factors outside of either company’s control could prevent them from completing the Merger until a later time or not to complete the Merger at all.

The obligations of one or both of CalAtlantic and Lennar to consummate the Merger are conditioned upon the satisfaction (or waiver by the
affected party) at or prior to the closing of the Merger of specified conditions, including the following:
 

 
•  the representations and warranties of the other party or parties are true and correct in all material respects on the closing date (with

specified exceptions);
 

 •  the other party will have fulfilled in all material respects all of its obligations under the merger agreement;

Table of Contents

 
•  since the date of the merger agreement, nothing will have occurred, and no condition will have come into being, that has had or is

reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the other party or parties (or on the surviving company after the Merger);
 

 •  the CalAtlantic Merger Proposal is approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of CalAtlantic common stock;
 

 
•  the Lennar Merger Proposal is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of Lennar

Class A common stock and Class B common stock that are voted (treating abstentions as votes against), voting together as though they
were a single class;

 

 

•  if approval of the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal is necessary to enable Lennar to issue all the shares of Class A common stock it
will be required to issue as a result of the Merger (which approval will probably not be necessary), the Lennar Authorized Share
Proposal is approved by the affirmative vote of (i) the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Lennar Class A
and Class B common stock, voting together as though they were a single class, and (ii) a majority of the shares of Lennar Class A
common stock that are voted with regard to the proposal;

 

 
•  no order of any court or other governmental authority will be in force that invalidates the merger agreement or restrains CalAtlantic,

Lennar or Merger Sub from completing the Merger;
 

 
•  the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part will have become effective under the Securities Act

and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement will have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose
will have been initiated or threatened in writing by the SEC;

 

 •  the shares of Lennar stock deliverable to CalAtlantic stockholders in the Merger will have been approved for listing on the NYSE; and
 

 
•  CalAtlantic will have received an opinion of its counsel, to the effect that the Merger will constitute a “reorganization” within the

meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

The conditions set forth in the merger agreement may be waived by Lennar or CalAtlantic, subject to applicable law and the agreement of the
other party in certain circumstances. If approval of the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal is not required in order for Lennar to be able to issue all
the shares it will be required to issue as a result of the Merger, including shares it may be required to issue as a result of conversions of CalAtlantic
convertible debt and exercises of CalAtlantic options, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights, Lennar will complete the Merger even if
the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal is not approved. For a more complete discussion of the conditions to the Merger, see “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 84.

No Solicitation; Notice of Proposals (See Page 90)

Subject to certain exceptions discussed below, CalAtlantic is required to:
 

 
•  terminate all ongoing discussions with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals or otherwise regarding possible

acquisition transactions; and
 

 

•  not authorize or approve and to use its reasonable best efforts so that none of its subsidiaries’ officers, directors, employees, agents or
other representatives will initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate (by making available non-public
information or otherwise) any alternative acquisition proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to (i) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction involving CalAtlantic, or (ii) any purchase of or tender or exchange
offer for all or any significant portion of CalAtlantic’s equity securities, or (iii) any purchase of all or, except in the ordinary course of
business, a significant portion of the assets of CalAtlantic and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

Table of Contents

Notwithstanding the above, in connection with any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to a possible acquisition transaction that
CalAtlantic receives despite complying in all material respects with the obligations listed immediately above, CalAtlantic, its subsidiaries and their
respective representatives may:
 

 
•  interact with a potential acquiror solely to clarify the terms and conditions of any alternative acquisition proposal that the potential

acquiror has made; and
 

 

•  furnish non-public information (after receipt of an appropriate confidentiality agreement) to, and enter into discussions and negotiations
with, a potential acquiror in response to an alternative acquisition proposal which (i) CalAtlantic receives despite complying in all
material respects with the prohibition against solicitation of proposals, and (ii) the CalAtlantic board of directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisor, constitutes or would be reasonably expected to be or result in a
transaction that would be more favorable to the CalAtlantic stockholders than the Merger.

A “superior proposal” means an alternative acquisition proposal, which (v) is not subject to the outcome of due diligence or any other form of
investigation, (w) is not subject to a financing contingency, (x) is from a potential acquiror which the CalAtlantic board reasonably determines in
good faith after consultation with its independent financial advisor has the financial resources necessary to carry out the transaction, (y) is not
reasonably likely to be the subject of regulatory concerns that could prevent or materially delay completion of the transaction, and (z) the
CalAtlantic board determines in good faith after consultation with its independent financial advisor, and taking account of, among other things, the
value of the synergy benefits resulting from the proposed transaction with Lennar, to be more favorable to the CalAtlantic’s stockholders than the
proposed transaction with Lennar.

If at any time, CalAtlantic receives an alternative acquisition proposal, request for non-public information in connection with such a proposal
or an indication that a prospective acquiror intends to make such a proposal, then within two business days, CalAtlantic must inform Lennar of the
proposal, request or indication, provide the identity of the third party from which the proposal, request or indication was received, and provide a
reasonably detailed description of the material terms of the proposal, request or indication. Further, CalAtlantic must thereafter promptly provide
Lennar with any additional material information CalAtlantic obtains regarding such proposal, request, indication or notification, and otherwise
keep Lennar reasonably informed as to the status of the alternative acquisition proposal.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (See Page 94)

The merger agreement may be terminated prior to the effective time of the Merger, whether before or after approval of the Merger proposal
by CalAtlantic stockholders, Lennar stockholders, or both (except as otherwise provided below), by the mutual written consent of CalAtlantic or
Lennar, or by one or both of CalAtlantic and Lennar as follows:

by either CalAtlantic or Lennar (provided that such party is not in breach or such party’s breach is not the primary cause of such condition, as
applicable):
 

 

•  if the closing date does not occur on or before May 31, 2018; provided, however, that if the closing does not occur on or before such
date because of an order of a court or other governmental authority invalidating the merger agreement or restraining a party from
completing the Merger, either CalAtlantic or Lennar may extend the outside date by three additional months until August 31, 2018 (we
refer to such date, including if extended, as the “outside date”);

 

 
•  if (i) any law is in effect that would make the Merger unlawful, or (ii) any order of any governmental entity is entered permanently

enjoining CalAtlantic, Lennar or Merger Sub from consummating the Merger and the order has become final and non-appealable;

Effect of Termination; Termination Fees; Expense Reimbursement (See Pages 96)

If the merger agreement is validly terminated, then, with certain exceptions, the merger agreement will be null and void and none of the
parties will have any further rights or obligations under it. However, termination of the merger agreement will not relieve either party of liability for
any knowing and intentional breach of any of its covenants and agreements in the merger agreement before the merger agreement is terminated.

CalAtlantic will be required to pay Lennar a termination fee of $178.7 million if:
 

 •  CalAtlantic terminates the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal;
 

 

•  CalAtlantic or Lennar terminates the merger agreement because the Merger has not closed by the outside date, and prior to the date of
termination, a company acquisition proposal shall have been submitted by a potential acquiror and not rejected or withdrawn, and
CalAtlantic completes an alternative transaction within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement with such potential
acquiror;

 

 

•  CalAtlantic or Lennar terminates the merger agreement because the CalAtlantic stockholders do not approve the Merger proposal, and
prior to the date of the stockholder meeting, a company acquisition proposal shall have been submitted and not rejected or withdrawn
by a potential acquiror, and CalAtlantic completes an alternative transaction within 12 months after termination of the merger
agreement with such potential acquiror;

 

 
•  Lennar terminates the merger agreement after the CalAtlantic board of directors withdraws or negatively modifies its recommendation

that CalAtlantic stockholders vote to approve the Merger;
 

 

•  Lennar terminates the merger agreement because CalAtlantic has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements in the merger agreement in a way that would give rise to failure of designated conditions to closing not being satisfied, and
this breach is either incurable or not cured within 30 business days after CalAtlantic’s receipt of written notice of the breach from
Lennar or one business day prior to the outside date;

 

 
•  Lennar terminates the merger agreement because all the conditions to CalAtlantic’s obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied,

but CalAtlantic has failed to consummate the Merger by the time the closing should have occurred pursuant to the merger agreement,
which failure is a breach of CalAtlantic’s obligations under the merger agreement; or

 

 

•  Lennar terminates the merger agreement because prior to approval of the Merger proposal by CalAtlantic stockholders, (i) the
CalAtlantic board of directors fails to reaffirm publicly its recommendation of the Merger within ten business days after an alternative
acquisition proposal is first publicly announced, if Lennar requests such a reaffirmation, or (ii) any person other than Parent and its
affiliates commences a tender or exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding CalAtlantic common stock, and (A) the CalAtlantic
board of directors or a board committee recommends that the CalAtlantic stockholders tender all or a portion of their CalAtlantic stock
in response to the offer, or (B) CalAtlantic does not within ten business days after the tender or exchange offer is commenced, file with
the SEC a Statement on Schedule 14D-9 which contains a recommendation that CalAtlantic stockholders not tender their CalAtlantic
common stock in response to the offer.

Lennar will be required to pay CalAtlantic a termination fee of $178.7 million if:
 

 

•  the merger agreement is terminated because the Merger does not take place by the outside date and (i) prior to the termination Lennar
had received or communicated a proposal to acquire a homebuilding company that in the preceding year had delivered at least 14,000
homes that is not rejected or withdrawn and (ii) within 12 months after the merger agreement is terminated, Lennar acquires that
homebuilding company;

covenants or agreements in the merger agreement in a way that would give rise to failure of designated conditions to closing, and this
breach is either incurable or not cured within 30 business days after Lennar’s receipt of written notice of such breach or one business
day prior to the outside date; or

 

 
•  CalAtlantic terminates the merger agreement because all the conditions to Lennar’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the Merger

have been satisfied, but Lennar and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Merger by the time the closing should have occurred
pursuant to the merger agreement, which failure is a breach of Lennar and Merger Sub’s obligations under the merger agreement.

If the Lennar stockholders do not give the stockholder approval or approvals that are necessary for Lennar to consummate the Merger, Lennar
will have to reimburse CalAtlantic for its reasonable out-of-pocket Merger related expenses, up to $30 million. If the CalAtlantic stockholders do
not give the stockholder approval that is necessary for CalAtlantic to consummate the Merger, CalAtlantic will have to reimburse Lennar for its
reasonable out-of-pocket Merger related expenses, up to $30 million.

be realized.

 •  the CalAtlantic Merger Proposal;
 

 •  the CalAtlantic Merger-Related Compensation Proposal; and
 

 •  the CalAtlantic Adjournment Proposal.

Approval of the CalAtlantic Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the
CalAtlantic common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. Approval of the CalAtlantic Merger-Related Compensation Proposal requires the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting interest of the CalAtlantic stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the
CalAtlantic special meeting in which a quorum is present and entitled to vote on the proposal, although such vote will not be binding on
CalAtlantic or its board of directors or any of its committees. Approval of the CalAtlantic Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of
holders of a majority in voting interest of the CalAtlantic stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the CalAtlantic special meeting
and entitled to vote on the proposal.

Ownership of CalAtlantic Shares by CalAtlantic Directors and Executive Officers (See Page 103)

to vote 30,586,507 shares of CalAtlantic common stock, or approximately 26.2% of the total voting power of the shares of CalAtlantic common
stock outstanding on that date.

Purpose of the Lennar Special Meeting; Required Vote (See Page 110)

At the Lennar special meeting, Lennar stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon:
 

 •  the Lennar Merger Proposal;
 

 •  the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal; and
 

 •  the Lennar Adjournment Proposal.

Approval of the Lennar Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the shares of Class A common stock
and Class B common stock that are voted with regard to the proposal at the Lennar special meeting at which a quorum is present (treating
abstentions as votes against), voting together as though they were a single class. The Lennar Authorized Share Proposal requires the affirmative
vote of both (i) the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting
together as though they were a single class, and (ii) the holders of a majority of the shares of Class A common stock that are voted with regard to
the proposal at the Lennar special meeting at which a quorum is present. The Lennar Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority in voting power of the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock that are voted, voting together as though they were a
single class.

Approval of the Lennar Merger Proposal is required for completion of the Merger. If the number of shares of Class A common stock that
Lennar is required to issue in the Merger exceeds the number of shares of Class A common stock that Lennar currently is authorized to issue
(which would be the case if no CalAtlantic stockholders exercise the cash election option under the merger agreement), approval of the Lennar
Authorized Share Proposal would also be required for completion of the Merger. Lennar has an agreement with MP CA Homes assuring that the
cash election will be exercised with respect to the maximum number of shares as to which it can be exercised, and therefore Lennar should be able
to complete the Merger even if the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal is not approved. See “The MP CA Homes Voting and Cash Election
Agreement.”

The Lennar board of directors unanimously recommends that Lennar stockholders vote “FOR” all the proposals set forth above, as more
fully described in the section titled “Lennar Special Meeting—Purpose of the Lennar Special Meeting” beginning on page 110.

Ownership of Lennar Shares by Lennar Directors and Executive Officers (See Page 102)

As of the record date, Lennar directors and executive officers and their affiliates owned and were entitled to vote 4,581,782 shares of Lennar
Class A common stock and 22,085,396 shares of Lennar Class B common stock, which gave them approximately 2.2% of the total voting power of
Lennar Class A common stock outstanding on that date, and approximately 40.0% of the total voting power of Lennar Class A and Class B Stock
outstanding on that date, voting together as though they were a single class.

SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA OF CALATLANTIC

The following statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and the balance sheet data as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015 have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of CalAtlantic contained in its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are incorporated into this document by reference. The statement of operations data for
the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the balance sheet data as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 have been derived from the
audited consolidated financial statements of CalAtlantic for such periods, which have not been incorporated into this document by reference.

The summary selected historical financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, and as of September 30, 2017, have
been derived from the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of CalAtlantic contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended September 30, 2017, which is incorporated into this document by reference. The summary selected historical financial data
as of September 30, 2016 have been derived from the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of CalAtlantic contained in its Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, which has not been incorporated into this document by reference. These
financial statements are unaudited, but, in the opinion of CalAtlantic’s management, contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly
CalAtlantic’s financial position and results of operations for the periods indicated.

On October 1, 2015, Standard Pacific Corp. completed its merger with The Ryland Group, Inc., with Standard Pacific Corp. continuing as the
surviving corporation and changing its name to CalAtlantic Group, Inc. Because the closing of the merger occurred during the year ended
December 31, 2015, the financial information and operating data below for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, includes only
stand-alone data for predecessor Standard Pacific Corp., and the financial information and operating data below for the year ended December 31,
2015 include Ryland’s operations only from and after October 1, 2015. In connection with the Standard Pacific/Ryland merger, CalAtlantic
completed a one-for-five reverse stock split. All prior period share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect such reverse stock split.
Effective December 31, 2015, CalAtlantic early adopted ASU No. 201503, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (“ASU 2015-03”).
ASU 2015-03 was retrospectively applied to the financial statements and as such, homebuilding other assets and homebuilding debt for all periods
presented have been adjusted accordingly. Please see Note 2.w. of the CalAtlantic consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015, set forth in CalAtlantic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. See the section entitled “Where
You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 133.

Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. This selected consolidated financial
data should be read in conjunction with CalAtlantic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and CalAtlantic’s
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2017, including the related notes and section captioned

SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following summary pro forma financial information is based on the historical financial statements of Lennar as of August 31, 2017 and
CalAtlantic as of September 30, 2017 and for the nine months then ended, and for the year ended November 30, 2016 for Lennar and for the year
ended December 31, 2016 for CalAtlantic, each of which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, adjusted to give
effect to the Merger and related financing as described under “The Merger—Financing Related to the Merger” and “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Statements of Lennar and CalAtlantic” included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This pro forma financial
information is being presented solely for informational purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations or financial
position that might have been achieved for the periods or dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
following the Merger.

The following table presents selected unaudited pro forma combined financial information about Lennar’s consolidated balance sheet and
statements of operations, after giving effect to the Merger. The information under “Statement of Operations Data” in the following table gives
effect to the Merger as if it had been consummated on December 1, 2015, the beginning of the earliest period presented. The information under
“Financial Position Data” in the following table assumes the Merger was consummated on August 31, 2017. This unaudited pro forma combined
financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting with Lennar considered the acquirer of CalAtlantic.

In addition, the unaudited pro forma combined financial information includes adjustments that are preliminary and may be revised. There can
be no assurance that such revisions will not result in material changes. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is presented for
illustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of financial results of the combined company.

The information presented below should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of Lennar and
CalAtlantic, including the related notes, filed by each of them with the SEC, and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and with the pro forma condensed combined financial statements of Lennar and CalAtlantic, including the related notes,
appearing elsewhere in this document. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 133 and “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Statements of Lennar and CalAtlantic” beginning on page F-1. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial data are presented for illustrative purposes only, and are not necessarily indicative of results that actually would have occurred or that may
occur in the future had the Merger been completed on the dates indicated. Accordingly this information should not be relied upon for purposes of
making any investment or other decisions.

The unaudited pro forma financial statements also give effect to the Senior Notes Offering as though it had occurred as of the same date as
the Merger.

Lennar’s fiscal year ends on November 30, and CalAtlantic’s fiscal year ends on December 31. As a consequence of Lennar’s and
CalAtlantic’s different fiscal year ends:
 

 
•  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of August 31, 2017 combines Lennar’s historical unaudited condensed

consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2017, which was the end of Lennar’s third fiscal quarter, and CalAtlantic’s historical
unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2017, which was the end of CalAtlantic’s third fiscal quarter.

 

 
•  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended August 31, 2017 combines Lennar’s

historical unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended August 31, 2017, which were the first
three quarters of Lennar’s

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

The following table shows Lennar’s and CalAtlantic’s per share data on a historical and pro forma combined basis. The pro forma
information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have
occurred if the Merger had been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating
results or financial position of the combined company.

Except for the historical information for the year ended November 30, 2016 for Lennar and December 31, 2016 for CalAtlantic, the
information in the table is unaudited.

The following comparative per share data for Lennar and for CalAtlantic is derived from the respective historical consolidated financial
statements of each of them included in their respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended November 30, 2016 and December 31,
2016, respectively, and their respective Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended August 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017,
respectively, all of which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The historical book value per share is computed
by dividing the total stockholders’ equity by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the period. The pro forma earnings
per share of the combined company is computed by dividing the pro forma income by the pro forma weighted average number of shares
outstanding. The pro forma book value per share of the combined company is computed by dividing the total pro forma stockholders’ equity by the
pro forma number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the period. This information should be read together with the unaudited pro
forma combined financial data included under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements of Lennar and CalAtlantic”
beginning on page F-1 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

CalAtlantic stockholders are advised to obtain current market quotations for CalAtlantic common stock and Lennar Class A and Class B
common stock. The market price of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock will fluctuate between the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the completion of the Merger. No assurance can be given concerning the market price of CalAtlantic common stock
before the effective date of the Merger. No assurance can be given concerning the market price of Lennar Class A or Class B common stock before
or after the effective date of the Merger.

Since December 30, 2015, the CalAtlantic board has declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.04 per share. Under the merger agreement,
CalAtlantic has agreed not to declare or pay any dividends, or make any other distributions, to its stockholders other than payments of quarterly
cash dividends in the ordinary course in amounts per share no greater than the quarterly cash dividends paid in the prior quarters of fiscal year
2017. In addition, on October 30, 2017, the CalAtlantic board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.04 per share of CalAtlantic common
stock, payable on December 30, 2017 to the holders of record at the close of business on December 15, 2017.

Since October 2008, the Lennar board of directors has declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.04 per share for both its Class A and its
Class B common stock. However, each quarter the Lennar board of directors evaluates the decision whether to declare a dividend and the amount
of the dividend. Lennar’s debt instruments include provisions that could under some circumstances affect its ability to pay dividends, but none of
them is likely to affect Lennar’s ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate. In addition, on October 29, 2017, the Lennar board of
directors declared a stock dividend of one share of Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock
outstanding, payable on November 27, 2017 to holders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2017.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters
addressed in the section titled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 36, you should carefully consider the
following risks before deciding how to vote, or if a CalAtlantic stockholder, whether or not to make a cash election. In addition, you should read and
carefully consider the risks associated with each of Lennar and CalAtlantic and their respective businesses. Descriptions of these risks can be found in
Lennar’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2016 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
August 31, 2017, and CalAtlantic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended September 30, 2017, which are filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For
further information regarding the documents incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference, please see “Where You Can Find
More Information” beginning on page 133. Realization of any of the risks described below, any of the events described in the section titled “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” or any of the risks or events described in the documents incorporated by reference could have a
material adverse effect on Lennar’s, CalAtlantic’s or the combined company’s businesses, financial conditions, cash flows and results of operations and
could result in a decline in the trading prices of Lennar’s Class A and Class  B common stock.

Risks Relating to the Merger

The exchange ratio and the cash consideration are fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in the stock price for either CalAtlantic
or Lennar.

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of CalAtlantic common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger (other than shares of CalAtlantic common stock held in CalAtlantic’s treasury or held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
CalAtlantic, and shares of CalAtlantic common stock held by Lennar or Merger Sub, immediately before the effective time of the Merger) will be
converted into and become the right to receive 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A common stock and 0.0177 shares of Lennar Class B common stock,
which is referred to as the “equity consideration.” In lieu of receiving the equity consideration, holders of CalAtlantic common stock will have the
option to elect to receive cash in the amount of $48.26 per share, without interest, in the Merger, which is referred to as the “cash consideration,” subject
to proration to the extent the aggregate cash to be paid to all holders electing to receive cash consideration would exceed $1,162,250,000, which is
referred to as the “maximum cash amount.”

Changes in the price of Lennar common stock prior to the Merger will affect the value of the equity consideration that CalAtlantic stockholders
may receive on the date of the Merger. The exchange ratio would be adjusted appropriately to fully reflect the effect of any stock dividend (other than
the Class B dividend), subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination, exchange of shares or
other similar event with respect to the shares of either CalAtlantic common stock or Lennar common stock prior to the closing of the Merger, if there
were such an event.

The prices of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock at the closing of the Merger may vary from their prices on the date the merger agreement
was executed, on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and on the date of each stockholder meeting. As a result, the value represented by the
exchange ratio will also vary. For example, based on the closing price of Lennar’s stock on the NYSE on October 27, 2017, the last trading day before
public announcement of the Merger, of $58.01 for its Class A common stock and $48.65 for its Class B common stock, 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A
common stock had a value of $51.34 and 0.0177 shares of Lennar Class B common stock had a value of $0.86 and, based on the closing price of
Lennar’s stock on NYSE on January 2, 2018, the latest practicable trading date before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, of $64.84 for its
Class A common stock and $52.61 for its Class B common stock, 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A common stock had a value of $57.38 and 0.0177
shares of Lennar Class B common stock had a value of $0.93. In addition, the per share price of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock and
CalAtlantic common stock also

could fluctuate after the deadline to make or withdraw cash elections passes, so that the market value of those securities moves from higher to lower, or
from lower to higher, than the $48.26 per share that would be paid as cash consideration. These variations could result from changes in the business,
operations or prospects of CalAtlantic or Lennar prior to or following the Merger, regulatory considerations, general market and economic conditions
and other factors both within and beyond the control of CalAtlantic or Lennar.

The Merger will not be completed until at least five business days after the deadline for making cash elections. Therefore, at the cash election
deadline, CalAtlantic stockholders will not know with certainty the value of the equity consideration that they will receive upon completion of the
Merger if they do not elect to receive cash or if the cash election is subject to proration.

CalAtlantic stockholders who elect to receive the cash consideration may nonetheless receive a prorated portion of their merger consideration in the
form of Lennar stock if the maximum cash amount is exceeded.

Elections to receive the cash consideration by CalAtlantic stockholders will be subject to the proration procedures set forth in the merger
agreement to the extent necessary so that CalAtlantic stockholders who elect cash will receive in the aggregate no more than the maximum cash amount
in the Merger. Depending on the elections made by all the CalAtlantic stockholders, valid elections for more than the maximum cash amount may be
received, in which case CalAtlantic stockholders who validly elected to receive the cash consideration in the Merger will receive a portion of their
merger consideration in the form of cash and the remainder in the form of the equity consideration. Stockholders who receive the equity consideration
will be subject to a number of risks relating to Lennar and its common stock discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section and in Lennar’s SEC
filings that are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

CalAtlantic and Lennar are subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions, including the risk of litigation, while the Merger is pending
that may cause disruption from the transaction and may make it more difficult to maintain or develop relationships with current or potential
employees, suppliers or customers.

Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on CalAtlantic and Lennar. These
uncertainties may impair CalAtlantic’s and Lennar’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period
of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with CalAtlantic and Lennar to seek to change existing or potential business
relationships with them.

Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging for CalAtlantic prior to the completion of the Merger, as employees and
prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Lennar. If key employees depart or prospective key employees fail to
accept employment with either company because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with Lennar,
CalAtlantic’s and Lennar’s financial results could be adversely affected. Furthermore, Lennar’s operational and financial performance following the
Merger could be adversely affected if it is unable to retain key employees and skilled workers of CalAtlantic or Lennar. The loss of the services of key
employees and skilled workers and their experience and knowledge regarding CalAtlantic’s or Lennar’s businesses could adversely affect Lennar’s
future operating results and its successful ongoing operation of the combined business.

The pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on each company’s management and internal
resources. The diversion of management attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and
integration process could adversely affect CalAtlantic’s and Lennar’s financial results.

In addition, the merger agreement restricts CalAtlantic, without Lennar’s consent, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified
actions until the Merger occurs or the merger agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent CalAtlantic from pursuing otherwise attractive
business opportunities and making other changes to its business prior to completion of the Merger or termination of the merger agreement. See the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Prior to Closing” beginning on page 87 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Lennar may have difficulty integrating the CalAtlantic business and anticipated benefits of combining CalAtlantic and Lennar may not be realized.

CalAtlantic and Lennar entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the Merger will result in various benefits, including, among
other matters, operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the
businesses of CalAtlantic and Lennar can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner.

CalAtlantic is much larger than any company that Lennar has ever previously acquired. In order to benefit from the cost savings and other
potential benefits of the Merger, Lennar will have to integrate many aspects of CalAtlantic’s activities into Lennar. This will be a major task. It is
possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of each
company’s ongoing businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation
arrangements, any of which could adversely affect Lennar’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. Lennar’s results of operations could
also be adversely affected by occurrences or events at CalAtlantic or Lennar before the effective time of the Merger. The companies may have difficulty
addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. The integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and
no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be realized or, if realized, the timing of their realization. Failure to achieve these anticipated
benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected net income and could adversely affect Lennar’s future business, financial
condition, operating results and prospects.

Completion of the transactions may trigger assignment, change of control or other provisions in certain agreements or licenses to which CalAtlantic
is a party.

The completion of the transactions may trigger assignment, change of control or other provisions in certain agreements or licenses to which
CalAtlantic is a party. If CalAtlantic and Lennar are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions in CalAtlantic’s agreements or licenses, the
counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, possibly terminating the agreements or licenses or seeking monetary
damages. Even if CalAtlantic and Lennar are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require fees for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the
agreements and licenses on terms less favorable to Lennar or the surviving corporation.

Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock prices and the future business and financial results of CalAtlantic and Lennar.

If the Merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of CalAtlantic and/or Lennar may be adversely affected, and CalAtlantic and Lennar will
be subject to a number of risks, including the following:
 

 
•  being required to pay a termination fee or expense reimbursement to the other party under certain circumstances provided in the merger

agreement;
 

 •  having to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;
 

 
•  declines in the stock prices of CalAtlantic common stock and Lennar common stock to the extent that the current market prices reflect a

market assumption that the Merger will be completed; and
 

 
•  results of having the focus of each company’s management on the Merger, which may divert management’s attention and potentially cause

such company not to pursue other opportunities that could have been beneficial to such company.

If the Merger is not completed, CalAtlantic and Lennar cannot assure their stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially
adversely affect the business, financial results and stock prices of CalAtlantic or Lennar.

The pro forma financial statements included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an
indication of Lennar’s financial condition or results of operations following the Merger.

The pro forma financial statements contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative purposes only. They are based
on historical results of Lennar and CalAtlantic, not on anticipated post-Merger results. They include various adjustments, assumptions and preliminary
estimates and may not be an indication of what the combined financial condition or results of operations of the two companies would have been if they
had been a single company throughout the periods to which the pro forma financial statements relate. See the section entitled “Selected Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements” beginning on page 18 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The actual financial condition and
results of operations of Lennar following the Merger may not be consistent with, or evident from, these pro forma financial statements.

The Merger is subject to certain conditions, including conditions that may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, or at all.

Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions which make the closing and timing of the Merger uncertain. The conditions
include, among others, obtaining the requisite stockholder approvals from the CalAtlantic and Lennar stockholders, the effectiveness of the registration
statement to which this joint proxy statement/prospectus relates, the authorization and approval for listing on the NYSE of the shares of Lennar common
stock to be issued in the Merger subject to official notice of issuance, and the other conditions set forth in the merger agreement. See “The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 84.

Although Lennar and CalAtlantic have agreed in the merger agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite approvals and
consents, there can be no assurance that these approvals and consents will be obtained. Even if obtained, these approvals and consents may be obtained
later than anticipated. Lennar and CalAtlantic will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.

Any delay in completing the Merger may reduce the benefits expected to be achieved thereunder.

The Merger is subject to a number of conditions beyond CalAtlantic’s and Lennar’s control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially
adversely affect its completion. CalAtlantic and Lennar cannot predict whether and when these conditions will be satisfied. Any delay in completing the
Merger could cause Lennar not to realize some of the synergies that CalAtlantic and Lennar expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed
within its expected time frame. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” beginning on page 84.

CalAtlantic’s executive officers and directors have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CalAtlantic
stockholders generally.

CalAtlantic’s executive officers and directors have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CalAtlantic
stockholders generally. CalAtlantic’s executive officers negotiated the terms of the merger agreement. The executive officers of CalAtlantic have
arrangements with CalAtlantic that provide for a cash retention bonus if the Merger is consummated and severance benefits if their employment is
terminated under certain circumstances following the completion of the Merger. CalAtlantic’s executive officers and directors also have rights to
indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that will survive completion of the Merger.

The CalAtlantic board of directors was aware of these interests at the time it approved the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. These interests may cause CalAtlantic’s directors and executive officers to view the CalAtlantic Merger Proposal differently and more
favorably than you may view it. See “The Merger—Interests of CalAtlantic Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 68 of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, for more information.

Table of Contents

The merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquiror of CalAtlantic.

The merger agreement contains “no shop” provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict CalAtlantic’s ability to solicit, initiate, or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate competing third-party proposals for the acquisition of CalAtlantic’s stock or assets. In addition, Lennar
generally has an opportunity to agree to modify the terms of the merger agreement in response to any competing acquisition proposals that the
CalAtlantic board of directors determines to be superior to the Merger. If CalAtlantic terminates the merger agreement in order to enter into a superior
transaction, it will have to pay Lennar a termination fee of $178.7 million. See “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation; Notice of Proposals”
beginning on page 90 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and “The Merger Agreement—Effect of Termination; Termination Fees” beginning on
page 96 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of
CalAtlantic from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value
than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the Merger. In particular, CalAtlantic’s need to pay a termination fee might reduce the
amount a potential third-party acquiror would be willing to pay to acquire CalAtlantic because of the added expense of the termination fee that may
become payable.

If the merger agreement is terminated and CalAtlantic determines to seek another business combination, it may not be able to negotiate a
transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger.

The shares of Lennar common stock that may be received by CalAtlantic stockholders as a result of the Merger will have different rights from the
shares of CalAtlantic common stock.

Upon completion of the Merger, holders of most of the shares of CalAtlantic common stock will become holders of shares of Lennar common
stock and their rights as stockholders will be governed by Lennar’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law. The rights of
holders of shares of Lennar’s common stock differ from those of CalAtlantic in important respects and, accordingly, the holders’ ability to benefit from
results of Lennar’s operations may be different from their pre-Merger ability to benefit from results of CalAtlantic’s operations. See the section entitled
“Comparison of Rights of Stockholders of CalAtlantic and Lennar” beginning on page 123 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

CalAtlantic and Lennar stockholders do not have dissenters’ or appraisal rights in the Merger.

Dissenters’ rights are statutory rights that, if applicable, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to
demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration
being paid or issued to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Under the DGCL, a stockholder does not have the right to dissent
from a merger as to shares that are listed on a national securities exchange unless the stockholders are required to receive in exchange for their shares of
stock something other than shares of stock of a company that is publicly listed on a securities exchange or held by more than 2,000 holders of record and
cash in lieu of fractional shares. Because CalAtlantic stockholders will receive Lennar stock that is listed on the NYSE unless they elect to receive cash,
they will not be entitled to exercise dissenters rights or otherwise to receive the appraised value of their CalAtlantic stock.

The fairness opinion obtained by the board of director of CalAtlantic from its financial advisor will not reflect changes in circumstances between
signing the merger agreement and the completion of the Merger.

The fairness opinion that the CalAtlantic board of directors received from J.P. Morgan, CalAtlantic’s financial advisor, was dated October 29,
2017, and speaks as of that date. The CalAtlantic board of directors has not obtained or arranged to obtain an updated fairness opinion as of the date of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus or as of the

effective time of the Merger. Changes in the operations and prospects of CalAtlantic or Lennar, general market and economic conditions and other
factors that may be beyond the control of CalAtlantic and Lennar, and on which the fairness opinion was based, may change, and that may alter the
value of CalAtlantic or Lennar or the prices of shares of CalAtlantic common stock or Lennar common stock by the effective time of the Merger. The
opinion does not speak as of the time the Merger will be completed or as of any date other than the date of the opinion. Because CalAtlantic does not
anticipate asking J.P. Morgan to update its opinion, the October 29, 2017 opinion does not address the fairness of the exchange ratio or the cash
consideration, from a financial point of view, at the time the Merger will be completed. The opinion is included as Annex C to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinion that the CalAtlantic board of directors received from J.P. Morgan and a summary of the material
financial analyses they provided to the CalAtlantic board of directors in connection with rendering such opinion, please refer to “The Merger—Opinion
of CalAtlantic’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 57 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of the other factors considered by
the board of directors of CalAtlantic in determining to approve the merger agreement and the Merger, please refer to “The Merger—CalAtlantic Board
Recommendation and Its Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 54 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

CalAtlantic and Lennar may incur substantial unexpected transaction fees and merger-related costs in connection with the Merger.

CalAtlantic and Lennar expect to incur a number of non-recurring expenses, totaling approximately $70 million, associated with completing the
Merger, including investment banking and legal fees, and the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Substantial additional costs will be incurred in the integration of the businesses of CalAtlantic and Lennar. Although it is expected that the elimination of
certain duplicative costs and other cost savings, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset
the transaction and merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved as rapidly as expected, or at all. Further, if the Merger is not
completed, CalAtlantic and Lennar would have to recognize many of these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger.

The market price of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock after the Merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares
of CalAtlantic common stock currently.

Upon completion of the Merger, except for holders receiving the cash consideration for all their CalAtlantic shares, holders of shares of
CalAtlantic common stock will become holders of shares of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock. The shares of Lennar common stock differ
from those of CalAtlantic common stock in important respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of Lennar and the market price of its shares of
Class A and Class B common stock following the Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of
operations of CalAtlantic. See “Comparison of Rights of Stockholders of CalAtlantic and Lennar” beginning on page 123 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

If the Merger does not qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, CalAtlantic and the stockholders of CalAtlantic may be
required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.

It is a condition to CalAtlantic’s completion of the Merger that Gibson Dunn, tax counsel to CalAtlantic, will have delivered an opinion to
CalAtlantic, dated as of the closing date of the Merger, to the effect that the Merger will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
“reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. This opinion will be based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual
matters from CalAtlantic and Lennar, as well as certain covenants and undertakings by CalAtlantic and Lennar. If any of the assumptions,
representations, covenants or undertakings is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect, the validity of the conclusions
reached by counsel in its opinion would be jeopardized. Additionally, an opinion of counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service, which we
refer to as the “IRS,” or any court, so there can be no certainty that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinion or that a court will
not sustain

such a challenge. If the IRS or a court determines that the Merger should not be treated as a “reorganization,” a holder of CalAtlantic common stock that
is a U.S. holder (as defined in the section entitled “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” beginning on page 75 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus ) would generally recognize gain or loss upon the exchange of CalAtlantic common stock for Lennar Class A and Class B common
stock pursuant to the Merger. In addition, if the Merger is not treated as a “reorganization,” CalAtlantic (and Lennar, as its parent) would recognize gain,
measured generally by the excess of the fair market value of its assets over its adjusted tax basis in such assets.

Holders of CalAtlantic and Lennar common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Merger and will exercise less
influence over management.

Holders of CalAtlantic common stock and Lennar Class A and Class B common stock currently have the right to vote in the election of the board
of directors and on other matters affecting CalAtlantic and Lennar, respectively. Upon the completion of the Merger, each CalAtlantic stockholder who
receives shares of Lennar common stock will become a stockholder of Lennar with a percentage ownership of Lennar that is smaller than the
stockholder’s percentage ownership of CalAtlantic. It is currently expected that the former stockholders of CalAtlantic as a group will receive shares in
the Merger constituting approximately 26% of the shares of Lennar common stock on a fully-diluted basis immediately after the Merger, assuming the
aggregate cash consideration to be paid to CalAtlantic stockholders equals the maximum cash amount. As a result, current stockholders of Lennar as a
group will own approximately 74% of the shares of Lennar common stock on a fully-diluted basis immediately after the Merger. Because of this,
individual CalAtlantic and Lennar stockholders may have less influence on the management and policies of Lennar following the Merger than they now
have on the management and policies of CalAtlantic and Lennar, respectively.

The Merger will significantly increase the ratio of Lennar’s homebuilding debt to its total capital, net of cash.

Lennar will incur or become subject to a substantial amount of additional debt as a result of the Merger. It has sold $1.2 billion of debt securities
primarily to finance the more than $1.16 billion it will pay to CalAtlantic stockholders who exercise (or are deemed to exercise) the cash election. See
“The Merger—Financing Related to the Merger.” In addition, the surviving corporation, which will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar, will
become subject to CalAtlantic’s homebuilding debt, which at September 30, 2017 totaled $3.8 billion. Lennar estimates that the Merger will increase the
ratio of its consolidated homebuilding debt to total capital, net of cash from its August 31, 2017 level of 39.6% to a pro forma level of 45.5%. To the
extent cash flows of the merged companies are less than anticipated, Lennar may not be able to reduce the ratio of its consolidated homebuilding debt to
total capital, net of cash until well after the end of fiscal year 2019, if it is ever able to do that.

The Merger will add a substantial amount of goodwill to Lennar’s balance sheet.

Because the price Lennar will be deemed to pay for the net assets of CalAtlantic for accounting purposes will depend on the value of the Class A
and Class B common stock when the Merger takes place, and neither those stock prices nor the value of the CalAtlantic assets Lennar will acquire in the
Merger will be known until the Merger takes place, Lennar will not know until after the Merger takes place the amount by which for accounting
purposes the amount Lennar pays will exceed the net value of the assets Merger Sub receives and the liabilities Merger Sub assumes in the Merger (i.e.,
the portion of the deemed purchase price that will be treated as purchasing goodwill). However, Lennar estimates that if the value of the Class A
common stock at the time of the Merger is $62.36 per share and the value of the Class B common stock at the time of the Merger is $49.47, the
respective prices of such shares at the close of trading on December 18, 2017, the Merger would result in Lennar’s adding approximately $3.4 billion to
the goodwill carried on its balance sheet. If it is determined in the future that the profits generated by the assets acquired in the Merger are not sufficient
to justify that goodwill, Lennar will have to write off some or all of it, and to charge the amount written off against its earnings.

Table of Contents

The amount of the merger consideration Lennar agreed to pay in the Merger was influenced by its assumption that it will be able to achieve
significant cost savings as a result of the Merger.

Lennar’s willingness to agree to the equity consideration and cash consideration reflected in the merger agreement was based in substantial part on
an analysis by Lennar’s management which concluded, among other things, that Lennar would be able to accomplish substantial annual savings in
selling, general and administrative costs and in operating costs following the Merger. Although Lennar’s management was previously able to achieve its
anticipated cost savings with regard to homebuilding activities of WCI Communities, Inc., which Lennar acquired in February 2017, CalAtlantic is
much larger than WCI Communities, Inc. or any other company Lennar has ever acquired. If Lennar is not able to accomplish significant cost savings
with regard to development of the CalAtlantic properties, and with regard to some of the properties or companies Lennar already owns, Lennar may not
be able to generate sufficient Merger-related revenues to justify the cost of the Merger to Lennar.

Risks Regarding an Investment in Lennar

All of Lennar’s businesses are subject to risks.

Lennar is engaged in several businesses. Although the principal source of its revenues and income are its homebuilding business, Lennar is also
engaged in mortgage lending, originating commercial mortgage loans for sale into securitizations, and other real estate related services, managing and
advising funds and entities that invest in real estate related assets, developing multifamily residential projects and investing in multi-use real estate
developments, as well as a number of businesses related to those activities. Each of Lennar’s businesses is subject to risks and uncertainties, most, but
not all, of which affect many companies engaged in the businesses in which Lennar is engaged. These risks are discussed in detail in Lennar’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2016, which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Lennar has a class of common stock that entitles holders to ten votes per share.

The stock Lennar has agreed to issue to CalAtlantic stockholders in the Merger is primarily Class A common stock. The Class A common stock
entitles the holders to one vote per share. Lennar also has outstanding Class B common stock, which is substantially identical to the Class A common
stock, except that the Class B common stock entitles the holders to ten votes per share. Although Lennar has almost six times as many shares of Class A
common stock outstanding as it has outstanding shares of Class B common stock, the ten votes per share give the Lennar Class B stockholders voting
control of Lennar.

Lennar has a stockholder who can exercise significant influence over matters that are brought to a vote of its stockholders.

Stuart Miller, Lennar’s Chief Executive Officer and a director, has voting control, through personal holdings and holdings by family-owned
entities, of Lennar Class B stock and, to a lesser extent, Lennar Class A common stock, that, based on the shares of Lennar stock that are expected to be
outstanding as of November 30, 2017, enables Mr. Miller to cast 39.0% of the votes that can be cast by the holders of both classes of Lennar common
stock combined (33.0% after the anticipated issuance of shares in connection with the Merger). That effectively gives Mr. Miller the power to control
the election of Lennar directors and the approval of most matters that are presented to its stockholders. Mr. Miller’s voting power might discourage
someone from seeking to acquire Lennar or from making a significant equity investment in Lennar, even if Lennar needed the investment to meet its
obligations or to operate its businesses. Also, because of his voting power, Mr. Miller could potentially cause Lennar common stockholders to approve
actions that are contrary to the desires of most of Lennar’s other stockholders.

Table of Contents

Lennar has a substantial amount of indebtedness, and will incur or become subject to substantial additional debt as a result of the Merger. This may
have an adverse effect on its businesses or limit its ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities.

As of August 31, 2017, Lennar’s consolidated debt, net of debt issuance costs and excluding amounts outstanding under its credit facilities, was
approximately $5.5 billion. It has incurred approximately $1.2 billion of debt in connection with the Merger and will become subject to approximately
$3.8 billion of pre-Merger CalAtlantic homebuilding debt. Neither the indentures governing Lennar’s senior notes nor the indentures governing the
CalAtlantic debt securities restrict Lennar’s future incurrence of additional secured or unsecured debt, and the agreement governing Lennar’s principal
credit facility allows it to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt. Lennar’s reliance on debt to help support its operations exposes it to a
number of risks, including:
 

 •  it may be particularly vulnerable to adverse general economic or homebuilding industry conditions;
 

 
•  it may find it difficult, or may be unable, to obtain financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other requirements that

would be in its best long-term interests;
 

 
•  its need to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its debt reduces the cash

flow available to fund operations and investments or for dividends or share repurchases;
 

 •  it may be put at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies engaged in similar businesses that are less leveraged; and
 

 
•  it may have to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of its important assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet its debt

repayment obligations.

The Lennar board can at any time cause Lennar to stop paying dividends

For a number of years, Lennar has paid dividends of $0.16 per share per year with regard to its Class A and Class B common stock. However, the
Lennar board may at any time cause Lennar to reduce the dividend or stop paying dividends.

Risks Relating to the Combined Company Following the Merger

If completed, the Merger may not achieve its intended results, and Lennar and CalAtlantic may have difficulty integrating their operations.

Lennar and CalAtlantic entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the Merger will result in various benefits, including, among
other things, expanding Lennar’s asset base and creating synergies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Merger is subject to a number of
uncertainties, including whether the businesses of Lennar and CalAtlantic can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner.

It is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees and the disruption of
CalAtlantic’s ongoing businesses or that inconsistencies in business methods could adversely affect Lennar’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits
of the Merger. Lennar’s future results of operations could also be adversely affected by issues attributable to CalAtlantic’s operations that result from
events or actions that occur prior to the Merger. The companies may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and
management philosophies. The integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits
will be realized or, if realized, that they will be realized within the anticipated time. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased
costs or decreases in the revenues from CalAtlantic’s business from those expected and could adversely affect the combined company’s future business
or operating results.

The market price of the shares of the combined company and the results of operations of the combined company after the Merger may be affected by
factors different from those affecting CalAtlantic or Lennar currently.

The businesses of Lennar and CalAtlantic differ in some respects and, accordingly, Lennar’s results of operations and the market price of its
Class A common stock and Class B common stock following the Merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the
independent results of operations and market prices of Lennar and CalAtlantic. For a discussion of the businesses of Lennar and CalAtlantic and of
certain factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference into this document and referred to in
“Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 133.

The combined company is expected to incur expenses related to the integration of Lennar and CalAtlantic.

Lennar is expected to incur expenses in connection with the integration of CalAtlantic into Lennar. There are a large number of processes,
policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be converted, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll,
pricing, revenue management, maintenance, marketing and employee benefits. While Lennar and CalAtlantic have assumed that a certain level of
expenses will be incurred, there are factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover,
many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. To the extent they exceed what is currently anticipated,
that could adversely affect Lennar’s operating results for periods following completion of the Merger.

THE MERGER

The following is a discussion of the Merger and the material terms of the merger agreement. You are urged to read carefully the merger agreement
in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein.

Background to the Merger

The CalAtlantic board of directors and senior management regularly review and consider CalAtlantic’s business, performance and strategic plan,
with the goal of enhancing value for CalAtlantic stockholders. As part of these reviews, the CalAtlantic board and senior management from time to time
consider strategic opportunities with third parties, including possible acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, and the potential benefits and risks of
these transactions. In addition, for a number of years the CalAtlantic board and its predecessors and senior management have held the view that industry
consolidation among U.S. homebuilders would benefit U.S. homebuilders in general and, on the right terms, the parties to such consolidation in
particular.

On June 14, 2017, MP CA Homes, an affiliate of MatlinPatterson Global Advisers LLC and CalAtlantic’s largest stockholder, completed a sale of
shares of CalAtlantic common stock in an underwritten public offering and a concurrent sale to CalAtlantic of shares of CalAtlantic common stock.

On June 16, 2017, David Matlin, the Chief Executive Officer of MatlinPatterson Global Advisers LLC and a director of CalAtlantic, received an
unsolicited telephonic call from a representative of Citigroup, Inc., which we refer to as “Citi”, requesting a meeting with Mr. Matlin. The Citi
representative did not specify an agenda for the meeting; however, Mr. Matlin frequently met with the Citi representative in the ordinary course of
business concerning investments of the investment funds and other affiliates controlled by Mr. Matlin. Mr. Matlin subsequently met in-person with the
Citi representative on June 20, 2017. At that meeting the Citi representative asked Mr. Matlin if he might be interested in meeting with the senior
management of Lennar the following day because they were in New York City for an industry conference.

On June 21, 2017, Mr. Matlin and another representative of MP CA Homes met in-person with the Citi representative, Stuart Miller, the Chief
Executive Officer of Lennar, and Rick Beckwitt, the President of Lennar. At this meeting, Messrs. Miller and Beckwitt and the Citi representative
provided their thoughts on the strategic merits for a combination of Lennar and CalAtlantic. Mr. Matlin responded that MP CA Homes was subject to a
Stockholders Agreement with CalAtlantic and that any proposal to combine the companies was a matter to be presented to and discussed with the
CalAtlantic board, and not with MP CA Homes. However, he indicated that MP CA Homes would be supportive of such a combination if the
CalAtlantic board decided to pursue one. After the meeting, Mr. Matlin contacted Larry T. Nicholson, CalAtlantic’s Chief Executive Officer and
President and a member of the CalAtlantic board, to notify him of the discussions.

On June 21, 2017, following the meeting with MP CA Homes, Mr. Beckwitt contacted Mr. Nicholson and proposed a dinner meeting. Later that
day, Messrs. Miller and Beckwitt and the Citi representative met with Mr. Nicholson, and at the meeting Messrs. Miller and Beckwitt communicated
Lennar’s interest in a potential business combination between Lennar and CalAtlantic, including Lennar’s views on the strategic merits of such a
combination. They said that Lennar was prepared to do a mostly stock transaction at a premium to the market price of CalAtlantic’s stock. However,
they said that Lennar would want discussions of a strategic combination to be exclusively between CalAtlantic and Lennar, that is, that Lennar would
not proceed with discussions if CalAtlantic decided to conduct an auction or other sales process. Mr. Nicholson reported this discussion to Scott D.
Stowell, CalAtlantic’s Executive Chairman of the board, William L. Jews, CalAtlantic’s Lead Independent Director, and Jeff J. McCall, CalAtlantic’s
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

On June 22, 2017, Mr. Nicholson told the representative of Citi that CalAtlantic would have an interest depending on the price and that the
CalAtlantic board would evaluate the proposal.

Later on June 22, 2017, Mr. Nicholson received a telephone call from Mr. Beckwitt during which Mr. Beckwitt submitted a verbal proposal for
Lennar to enter into a business combination transaction with CalAtlantic in a primarily stock transaction at a purchase price of $39.50 per share of
CalAtlantic common stock. He discussed the benefits that Lennar believed supported a strategic combination (including the potential size of the
combined company, possible synergies from the transaction and each party’s leading market positions). Mr. Nicholson understood from the conversation
that Lennar anticipated that there would be no role for CalAtlantic’s senior management team with the combined company. Mr. Beckwitt said that
Lennar was prepared to sign a confidentiality agreement and was prepared to move quickly, but again reiterated that Lennar would only proceed on an
exclusive basis. Mr. Nicholson informed Mr. Beckwitt that the CalAtlantic board believed that CalAtlantic’s standalone strategy presented significant
opportunities to create value for the stockholders, but that he would report the proposal to the CalAtlantic board. Lennar’s proposal represented an
approximately 12.4% premium to the closing price per share of CalAtlantic common stock of $35.14 on June 21, 2017, the last full trading day prior to
Lennar’s proposal.

On June 27, 2017, the CalAtlantic board held a telephonic meeting to discuss Lennar’s proposal, with an additional member of CalAtlantic senior
management attending. After reviewing and considering Lennar’s proposal and certain financial information and other materials, including preliminary
materials prepared by J.P. Morgan, at the request of Mr. McCall, which provided a general overview of the homebuilding industry and recent M&A and
capital market activity in the industry, matters on which J.P. Morgan was consulted from time to time by the CalAtlantic board, the CalAtlantic board
concluded that Lennar’s proposal was inadequate and that continuing to implement CalAtlantic’s standalone strategy was expected to be in the best
interests of the stockholders. Also at this meeting, the CalAtlantic board formed an informal exploratory committee (the “Exploratory Committee”), for
convenience and expediency in order to assist the CalAtlantic board in managing any future interactions with Lennar and to interface with senior
management of CalAtlantic—on behalf of the CalAtlantic board. Bruce A. Choate, Mr. Jews, Mr. Matlin and Norman J. Metcalfe, were appointed to the
Exploratory Committee.

On June 30, 2017, Mr. Beckwitt told Mr. Nicholson in a telephone conversation that the Lennar board is supportive of a transaction, and that
Lennar had room to move with regard to price if CalAtlantic would engage in negotiations. Mr. Nicholson informed Mr. Beckwitt that there had been a
CalAtlantic board call on June 27, 2017, but the board had not decided to hire an investment banker. He said the CalAtlantic board believed that the
$39.50 was inadequate, and that it would wait to hear whether Lennar would be interested at a higher price.

On July 6, 2017, Jon Jaffe, the Chief Operating Officer of Lennar, met with Mr. Stowell, and they discussed the benefits to both companies by
combining. Mr. Stowell said the CalAtlantic board understood the merits of a combination, but believed that the price that Lennar was proposing was
inadequate.

On July 10, 2017, Mr. Beckwitt submitted to Mr. Nicholson a revised verbal proposal for Lennar to enter into a business combination transaction
with CalAtlantic in a primarily stock transaction at a purchase price of $40.50 per share of CalAtlantic common stock. Lennar’s revised proposal
represented an approximately 13% premium to the closing price per share of CalAtlantic common stock of $35.89 on July 7, 2017, the last full trading
day prior to Lennar’s revised proposal.

On July 11, 2017, the Exploratory Committee held a telephonic meeting to discuss Lennar’s revised proposal. After reviewing and discussing
Lennar’s proposal, the Exploratory Committee concluded that Lennar’s proposal was inadequate. The Exploratory Committee communicated its
decision to Mr. Nicholson.

On July 12, 2017, Mr. Nicholson called Mr. Beckwitt and informed him that the Exploratory Committee had determined that the revised proposal
of $40.50 per share was inadequate.

On July 13, 2017, Mr. Beckwitt submitted to Mr. Nicholson a further revised verbal proposal for Lennar to enter into a business combination
transaction with CalAtlantic in a primarily stock transaction at a purchase price

of $42.00 per share of CalAtlantic common stock. Lennar’s proposal represented an approximately 15% premium to the closing price per share of
CalAtlantic common stock on July 12, 2017, the last full trading day prior to Lennar’s proposal.

On July 14, 2017, the Exploratory Committee held a telephonic meeting to discuss Lennar’s revised proposal and how to respond to Lennar, with
members of CalAtlantic senior management attending. After reviewing and discussing the revised proposal, the Exploratory Committee determined to
hold another meeting to further discuss Lennar’s proposal and whether to further engage.

On July 14, 2017, Mr. Nicholson informed Mr. Beckwitt that he would not be able to get back to Mr. Beckwitt on the revised proposal until the
following week.

On July 17, 2017, the Exploratory Committee held a further telephonic meeting to discuss Lennar’s revised proposal and how to respond to
Lennar, with members of CalAtlantic senior management attending. After such discussion, the Exploratory Committee determined that while no
decision had been made with respect to a transaction with Lennar and Lennar’s current proposal was viewed as inadequate, additional information was
required to better understand Lennar’s proposals, the extent to which Lennar might be willing to raise its price and whether to engage further. The
Exploratory Committee authorized CalAtlantic’s senior management to meet with the senior management of Lennar to discuss Lennar’s proposal
regarding a potential business combination with CalAtlantic, including potentially sharing recent field budgets, although preliminary, with Lennar.

On July 18, 2017, Mr. Nicholson called Mr. Beckwitt and said that at a meeting the previous day, the Exploratory Committee had authorized
CalAtlantic’s senior management to meet with Lennar senior management to review CalAtlantic’s preliminary five year field budgets at a high level in
order to show Lennar why its proposed price was inadequate, if Lennar wanted such a meeting.

On July 20, 2017, certain members of CalAtlantic’s senior management met with certain members of Lennar’s senior management to discuss
CalAtlantic’s operations and strategy in light of Lennar’s recent proposals. No determination or commitment with respect to a business combination
transaction between CalAtlantic and Lennar was made at this meeting.

On July 24, 2017, Mr. Beckwitt called Mr. Nicholson and presented a further revised proposal for Lennar to enter into a business combination
transaction with CalAtlantic in a primarily stock transaction at a purchase price of $44.00 per share of CalAtlantic common stock (the “July 24
Proposal”). The July 24 Proposal represented an approximately 16.0% premium to the closing price per share of CalAtlantic common stock of $37.93 on
July 21, 2017, the last full trading day prior to Lennar’s submission of the July 24 Proposal. The July 24 Proposal represented an implied exchange ratio
of 0.825 shares of Lennar Class A common stock for each share of CalAtlantic stock, based on the $53.33 closing price of Lennar Class A common
stock on July 21, 2017.

On July 25, 2017, the CalAtlantic board held a regularly scheduled telephonic meeting, with members of CalAtlantic senior management
attending. Members of CalAtlantic senior management provided an update on the July 20, 2017 meeting that they had with members of Lennar’s senior
management and the interactions with Lennar to date. The CalAtlantic board discussed the July 24 Proposal and confirmed that it was not embarking on
a process to engage in a business combination transaction with Lennar at that time. The CalAtlantic board nonetheless concluded, that in light of
Lennar’s further increased proposal, it would be advisable to take additional time and receive input from a financial advisor and legal counsel to
evaluate the July 24 Proposal. Also at this meeting, the CalAtlantic board established an advisory committee (the “Advisory Committee”), for
convenience and in order to assist the CalAtlantic board in managing any future interactions with Lennar, and if any further proposals were made by
Lennar, to assess such proposals and make a recommendation to the CalAtlantic board with respect to such proposals by, and engagement with, Lennar.
Messrs. Choate, Jews, Metcalfe and Robert E. Mellor, each of whom was determined to be independent and disinterested, were appointed to the
Advisory Committee, and Mr. Choate was selected as Chair of the Advisory Committee. The

Advisory Committee replaced the previously formed Exploratory Committee. The CalAtlantic board authorized the Advisory Committee to engage a
financial advisor and legal counsel to assist the Advisory Committee and the CalAtlantic board to assess the July 24 Proposal. The CalAtlantic board
further instructed members of CalAtlantic senior management to inform Mr. Beckwitt that the CalAtlantic board was evaluating the July 24 Proposal
and had determined to engage financial and legal advisors to assist in such evaluation.

Following the CalAtlantic board meeting, the Advisory Committee considered potential financial advisors, including J.P. Morgan, for possible
engagement to assist the Advisory Committee and the CalAtlantic board in the review of the Lennar proposal and related matters, and requested that
CalAtlantic’s management collect information on each of the financial advisors. In addition, the Advisory Committee determined to engage Gibson,
Dunn & Crutcher LLP, which we refer to as Gibson Dunn, one of CalAtlantic’s regular outside legal advisors, to assist in the evaluation of the Lennar
proposal and related matters.

On July 26, 2017, Mr. Nicholson left a message for Mr. Beckwitt in which he said that the CalAtlantic board had determined that it needed more
time to review the July 24 Proposal.

On July 27, 2017, CalAtlantic announced its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.

On July 28, 2017, Mr. Nicholson called Mr. Beckwitt and told him that the Advisory Committee had asked CalAtlantic’s senior management to
assist them in evaluating CalAtlantic’s standalone value and review of the preliminary field budgets.

On August 1, 2017, the Advisory Committee held a telephonic meeting, with John P. Babel, CalAtlantic’s Executive Vice President, General
Counsel and Secretary, and representatives of Gibson Dunn attending. A representative of Gibson Dunn reviewed the fiduciary duties of the Board in
light of a potential business combination transaction with Lennar. The Advisory Committee discussed the potential engagement of J.P. Morgan, and
various aspects of the July 24 Proposal and the scope of work to be performed by CalAtlantic’s financial advisor. After consideration, the Advisory
Committee determined that J.P. Morgan would be selected to perform a preliminary valuation analysis of CalAtlantic and to assist the Advisory
Committee and the CalAtlantic board with assessing the July 24 Proposal. J.P. Morgan was selected based on, among other factors, its qualifications,
expertise and reputation, including its industry experience advising homebuilding companies on strategic transactions (including Standard Pacific Corp.
in its merger with The Ryland Group, Inc.), and its familiarity with CalAtlantic’s affairs, business and operations (including advising CalAtlantic on
certain capital markets transactions), and after consideration of its prior relationships with CalAtlantic, MP CA Homes and Lennar. J.P. Morgan was
formally engaged by CalAtlantic on September 15, 2017.

On August 2, 2017, Mr. Beckwitt called Mr. Nicholson and said Lennar was still interested in pursuing a combination.

On August 2, 2017, Messrs. Stowell and Nicholson informed Mr. Beckwitt and the representative of Citi, at the instruction of the CalAtlantic
board and the Advisory Committee, that CalAtlantic had engaged J.P. Morgan to perform a preliminary valuation analysis of CalAtlantic in light of the
July 24 Proposal, and that the July 24 Proposal remained under consideration by the CalAtlantic board. They said that CalAtlantic was not ready to sign
a confidentiality agreement. Mr. Beckwitt told Messrs. Stowell and Nicholson that Lennar would not participate if CalAtlantic commenced a sales
process.

On August 3, 2017, representatives of Citi contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan and discussed Lennar’s interest in a business combination with
CalAtlantic, as well as the strategic benefits of such combination and the conversations that had been had to date between the Lennar management team
and the CalAtlantic management team.

Over the month of August, 2017, the Advisory Committee met three additional times to consider, with the assistance of representatives of J.P.
Morgan and Gibson Dunn, a potential business combination transaction with

Lennar, the July 24 Proposal and CalAtlantic’s standalone strategy. In the course of these meetings, the Advisory Committee reviewed and assessed,
among other factors, CalAtlantic’s internal financial projections prepared by CalAtlantic management (which are summarized in the section entitled
“Unaudited Prospective Financial Information—CalAtlantic Management’s Unaudited Prospective Standalone Financial Information and the Synergies”
beginning on page 63), CalAtlantic’s operating metrics relative to those of other comparable companies in the U.S. homebuilding industry, CalAtlantic’s
quarterly and annual earnings per share results relative to estimated results, Lennar’s historical and prospective operating and financial performance, and
illustrative valuation analyses for CalAtlantic and Lennar.

On August 14, 2017, Messrs. Nicholson and Stowell told Mr. Beckwitt and the representative of Citi that CalAtlantic was working with J.P.
Morgan and Gibson Dunn to evaluate the Lennar offer against a standalone strategy. They said that CalAtlantic’s management was in the process of
reviewing the preliminary field budgets they had previously discussed with Lennar senior management.

On August 17, 2017, the CalAtlantic board held a telephonic meeting, with members of CalAtlantic senior management, and representatives of
J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn, attending. Messrs. Stowell and Nicholson summarized for the CalAtlantic board the interactions they had had with
representatives of Lennar to date. At this meeting, the CalAtlantic board received an update on the Advisory Committee’s process to date and the
Advisory Committee noted that it would soon reach a recommendation with respect to the July 24 Proposal. During this meeting, at the request of the
CalAtlantic board, representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an overview of, among other matters, J.P. Morgan’s preliminary valuation analysis of each of
CalAtlantic and Lennar on a standalone basis, and a preliminary combination analysis based on Lennar’s proposal, taking into account, among other
matters, the internal financial projections and discussions with CalAtlantic senior management. A substantially identical presentation by representatives
of J.P. Morgan had been presented to and considered by the Advisory Committee at a telephonic meeting of the Advisory Committee held on August 10,
2017, with members of CalAtlantic senior management attending for a portion of the meeting, including a portion of J.P. Morgan’s presentation, and
representatives of Gibson Dunn also attending. A portion of J.P. Morgan’s presentation was made during executive session, without Messrs. Stowell and
Nicholson or members of management present, during which the CalAtlantic board reviewed the preliminary financial analysis presented by
representatives of J.P. Morgan.

On August 19, 2017, the Advisory Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of Gibson Dunn attending, and Mr. Stowell
attending for a portion of the meeting. The Advisory Committee discussed, among other matters, the preliminary analysis previously presented by
representatives of J.P. Morgan on CalAtlantic’s standalone strategy, including management’s financial projections, and CalAtlantic’s historical and
projected performance and the value and risks associated with the standalone strategy and the July 24 Proposal. During executive session without
Mr. Stowell present, after discussion and consideration of the information received by it, the Advisory Committee determined that they believed, based
on the information presented, that it was in the best interests of CalAtlantic and its stockholders for CalAtlantic to continue to implement its standalone
strategy, and therefore to recommend to the CalAtlantic board that CalAtlantic should focus on successfully executing its standalone strategy and take
steps to mitigate risks to achieve management’s financial projections, rather than engaging with Lennar at that time regarding a proposed business
combination transaction.

On August 20, 2017, Mr. Choate, as Chair of the Advisory Committee, communicated the Advisory Committee’s recommendation to the members
of the CalAtlantic board. Mr. Choate’s message noted that the recommendation would be discussed at a previously scheduled in-person meeting of the
CalAtlantic board to be held on August 22, 2017.

On August 22, 2017, the CalAtlantic board held an in-person meeting, with members of CalAtlantic senior management and representatives of
Gibson Dunn attending in-person, and representatives of J.P. Morgan attending telephonically. During executive session without members of CalAtlantic
senior management, and with representatives of J.P. Morgan present telephonically, the CalAtlantic board discussed the recommendation of,

and the matters considered by, the Advisory Committee. Representatives of J.P. Morgan reviewed again its preliminary valuation analysis of each of
CalAtlantic and Lennar on a standalone basis, and a preliminary combination analysis based on the July 24 Proposal. During executive session without
members of CalAtlantic senior management or representatives of J.P. Morgan attending, the CalAtlantic board deliberated on, among other matters, J.P.
Morgan’s preliminary financial analysis, the potential value provided by the July 24 Proposal, the achievability of the internal financial projections and
steps that may be taken to de-risk the achievement of the internal financial projections and successfully execute its standalone strategy. The CalAtlantic
board also discussed the fact that, at that point in time, Lennar had not provided non-public information to CalAtlantic or provided its internal
projections and accordingly, while the valuation analysis of CalAtlantic was informed by internal financial projections, the valuation analysis of Lennar
was informed solely by publicly available information. After extensive discussion, the CalAtlantic board determined that, while it had made no decision
with respect to a potential business combination transaction with Lennar, it was in the best interests of CalAtlantic stockholders for the CalAtlantic
board to obtain additional information from Lennar so that the CalAtlantic board, with the assistance of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn, could better
evaluate Lennar’s stock-for-stock proposal. The CalAtlantic board instructed representatives of J.P. Morgan to obtain additional business and financial
information from Lennar, to include members of CalAtlantic’s management who could also assess the information in any meeting, and to report back to
the CalAtlantic board.

Following the August 22, 2017 meeting of the CalAtlantic board, Mr. Nicholson informed Mr. Beckwitt, at the instruction of the CalAtlantic
board, that a final determination with respect to Lennar’s proposal had not been reached by the CalAtlantic board, and that additional information was
required for the CalAtlantic board to make a fully informed decision with respect to the July 24 Proposal.

On August 28, 2017, in response to the CalAtlantic board’s request for additional information from Lennar, members of CalAtlantic senior
management and representatives of J.P. Morgan had a telephonic meeting with members of Lennar senior management and representatives of Citi, to
discuss and review Lennar’s non-public management plan.

On September 3, 2017, the CalAtlantic board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the July 24 Proposal and the non-public information provided
by Lennar, with members of CalAtlantic senior management, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn, attending. Representatives of J.P.
Morgan provided a preliminary combination analysis based on, among other matters, the Lennar management plan and the CalAtlantic internal financial
projections. Also during this meeting, members of CalAtlantic senior management reviewed CalAtlantic’s internal financial projections. The CalAtlantic
board also discussed other potential strategic transaction partners for CalAtlantic, and the ability of such potential partners to consummate a transaction.
During executive session without members of CalAtlantic senior management or representatives of J.P. Morgan present, the CalAtlantic board discussed
a potential business combination transaction with Lennar in light of, among other matters, CalAtlantic’s standalone strategy and prospects. An extensive
discussion followed on strategic considerations, including whether providing a counterproposal to Lennar’s current proposal may result in a further
increase in per share price, and the nature and value of such a counterproposal. Representatives of Gibson Dunn also reviewed the directors’ fiduciary
duties in light of a potential business combination transaction with Lennar. After a thorough review and discussion of Lennar’s proposal, the CalAtlantic
board determined that it was in the best interests of CalAtlantic stockholders to continue to evaluate Lennar’s proposal and to engage with Lennar with a
view towards evaluating the potential terms upon which a business combination transaction may be agreed. The CalAtlantic board further concluded
that, having determined to engage with Lennar at that time, the Advisory Committee was no longer necessary and that it would be more efficient and
timely for the entire CalAtlantic board to evaluate any business combination transaction with Lennar.

On September 4, 2017, representatives of Gibson Dunn provided an update to representatives of J.P. Morgan on the CalAtlantic board’s proposed
response to Lennar. On September 5, 2017, representatives of J.P. Morgan had a discussion with Mr. Stowell and certain members of the CalAtlantic
board regarding potential strategies for

responding to Lennar, and the participants on the call agreed, subject to confirmation from the other members of the CalAtlantic board, to submit a
counterproposal to Lennar for a purchase price of $48.00 per share of CalAtlantic common stock. Mr. Stowell discussed this proposal with other
members of the CalAtlantic board, and after such discussions and confirmation from other members of the CalAtlantic board, Mr. Stowell instructed
representatives of J.P. Morgan to contact Citi to submit the counterproposal to Lennar.

Later in the day on September 5, 2017, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of Citi to communicate the CalAtlantic
counterproposal of $48.00 per share of CalAtlantic common stock. CalAtlantic’s counterproposal represented an approximately 37.5% premium to the
closing price per share of CalAtlantic common stock of $34.91 on September 1, 2017, the last full trading day prior to CalAtlantic’s counterproposal.
Based on the closing price of the Lennar Class A common stock of $51.76 on September 1, 2017, the $48.00 counterproposal represented an implied
exchange ratio of 0.927 shares of Lennar Class A common stock for each share of CalAtlantic stock.

On September 6, 2017, representatives of Citi informed representatives of J.P. Morgan that while Lennar continued to recognize the strategic
merits of a business combination transaction with CalAtlantic, Lennar did not accept the CalAtlantic counterproposal and that instead Lennar had
reiterated the July 24 Proposal of $44.00 per share of CalAtlantic common stock.

On September 7, 2017, the CalAtlantic board held a telephonic meeting, with members of CalAtlantic senior management, and representatives of
J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn, attending. The CalAtlantic board discussed, among other matters, the recent interactions with Lennar and Lennar’s
proposal, including the exchange ratio of shares of Lennar common stock to be received for each share of CalAtlantic common stock, as implied by
Lennar’s proposal for a primarily stock transaction at a purchase price of $44.00 per share of CalAtlantic common stock. Because all members of the
CalAtlantic board were not able to attend the meeting, the CalAtlantic board determined that it would reconvene prior to making a determination with
respect to Lennar’s proposal.

On September 9, 2017, the CalAtlantic board convened another telephonic meeting, with members of CalAtlantic senior management, and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn, attending. The CalAtlantic board reviewed those matters previously discussed at the September 7,
2017 meeting. The CalAtlantic board also discussed, with the assistance of the representatives of J.P. Morgan, an evaluation of a business combination
with Lennar focused on obtaining a fixed exchange ratio that would be beneficial to the stockholders of CalAtlantic and permit CalAtlantic stockholders
to have meaningful participation in the benefits of a combined company, in light of Lennar’s proposal being a primarily stock transaction.
Representatives of Gibson Dunn provided an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties in the context of a primarily stock transaction. After further
discussion, the CalAtlantic board determined that the appropriate measure for evaluating Lennar’s stock-for-stock proposal was an exchange ratio and
consideration of the pro forma ownership of the combined company that would be held by CalAtlantic stockholders, rather than a nominal price, and
further determined to submit a counterproposal to Lennar at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.91 shares of Lennar common stock to be received for each share
of CalAtlantic common stock, with an implied pro forma ownership for CalAtlantic stockholders of over 31.0%.

On September 11, 2017, representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated to representatives of Citi, CalAtlantic’s counterproposal of a fixed
exchange ratio of 0.91 shares of Lennar common stock per share of CalAtlantic common stock. The closing price per share of CalAtlantic common
stock and Lennar Class A common stock on September 8, 2017, the last full trading day prior to CalAtlantic’s counterproposal, was $34.60 and $50.54,
respectively. As of such date, the fixed exchange ratio of 0.91 represented an implied price per share of CalAtlantic common stock of approximately
$45.99 and a premium of approximately 32.9% to the closing price per share of CalAtlantic common stock on September 8, 2017.

On September 12, 2017, representatives of Citi communicated to representatives of J.P. Morgan that while Lennar remained interested in a
business combination transaction with CalAtlantic, Lennar did not accept the

CalAtlantic counterproposal and that instead Lennar reiterated its prior proposal of $44.00 per share of CalAtlantic common stock, which they believed
fully valued CalAtlantic common stock. They also communicated that they were considering a stock transaction, but would provide an ability for some
cash election. At the request of Mr. Stowell, representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated Lennar’s response to the members of the CalAtlantic board.

From September 12, 2017 to September 14, 2017, members of the CalAtlantic board, along with members of CalAtlantic senior management, and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn, considered potential responses to Lennar’s rejection of CalAtlantic’s counterproposal and the rationale
for structuring a primarily stock transaction, even with a cash election, based on a fixed exchange ratio – rather than nominal price – to ensure the extent
to which stockholders of CalAtlantic would be able to participate in the benefits of a combined company. After consideration of these matters and the
matters previously presented to and discussed by the CalAtlantic board, the CalAtlantic board instructed representatives of J.P. Morgan to inform Citi
that the CalAtlantic board desired a fixed exchange ratio proposal from Lennar before determining whether to proceed with further discussions
regarding a business combination transaction.

On September 14, 2017, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of Citi to communicate the CalAtlantic board’s desire that
Lennar submit a proposal for a potential business combination transaction based on a fixed exchange ratio.

On September 15, 2017, representatives of J.P. Morgan met with representatives of Citi to further clarify Lennar’s proposal and CalAtlantic’s
desire that Lennar submit a proposal for a potential business combination transaction based on a fixed exchange ratio.

On September 16, 2017, representatives of Citi contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to communicate a revised proposal from Lennar. The
revised proposal was for mixed consideration consisting of approximately 76 percent Lennar Class A common stock and approximately 24 percent cash,
with stock consideration of 0.856 shares of Lennar Class A common stock for each share of CalAtlantic common stock and cash consideration of $41.80
per share of CalAtlantic common stock. Lennar said it wanted to have the right to purchase for cash either the approximately 25.4% of the outstanding
CalAtlantic shares owned by MP CA Homes or the Lennar shares that would be issued as consideration for those CalAtlantic shares. Representatives of
Citi also noted that on the basis of its revised proposal, Lennar would be amenable to each company performing due diligence on the other in an effort to
reach a mutually agreed business combination transaction. Closing prices of CalAtlantic and Lennar common stock on September 15, 2017, were $34.95
and $51.31, respectively. As of such date, the stock consideration of 0.856 shares represented an implied price per share of CalAtlantic common stock of
approximately $43.92 and a premium of approximately 25.7% to the price per share of CalAtlantic common stock, and the cash consideration of $41.80
represented a premium of approximately 19.6% to the price per share of CalAtlantic common stock.

On September 17, 2017, the CalAtlantic board held a telephonic meeting to review Lennar’s revised proposal, with members of CalAtlantic senior
management, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn, attending. Representatives of J.P. Morgan provided an overview of Lennar’s revised
proposal and a preliminary comparison to Lennar’s prior proposal of $44.00 per share of CalAtlantic common stock. The CalAtlantic board discussed
with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn that the revised proposal represented a lower implied value per share of CalAtlantic common stock
than Lennar’s prior proposal. The CalAtlantic board considered, among other matters, the implied value of Lennar’s revised proposal, the CalAtlantic
board’s prior counterproposal of a 0.91 exchange ratio, and the risks and benefits associated with certain responses to Lennar. After further discussion,
the CalAtlantic board concluded that Lennar’s revised proposal was inadequate. The CalAtlantic board decided that in view of Lennar’s inadequate
proposal, it was in the best interests of CalAtlantic stockholders for CalAtlantic to cease engagement with Lennar at such time regarding a business
combination transaction, and to instead continue executing on its standalone strategy. The CalAtlantic board instructed representatives of J.P. Morgan to
communicate its decisions to Citi. During a subsequent executive session, without members of CalAtlantic senior

management or representatives of J.P. Morgan present, the CalAtlantic board discussed what steps, if any, were needed to improve CalAtlantic’s ability
to execute its standalone strategy. The CalAtlantic board determined to hold a subsequent meeting to review and assess CalAtlantic’s standalone
strategy. Mr. Jews was asked to communicate the CalAtlantic board’s desire to have a meeting with management to review the company’s standalone
strategy.

Following the telephonic CalAtlantic board meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of Citi to communicate the
CalAtlantic board’s decision to cease engagement with Lennar regarding a business combination transaction, and to instead continue executing on its
standalone strategy.

On September 18, 2017, Mr. Beckwitt contacted a representative of J.P. Morgan and engaged in a general discussion regarding the reasons for the
CalAtlantic board’s rejection of Lennar’s revised proposal and its decision to continue executing on its standalone strategy.

After such communication, no further communications were received from Lennar or its representatives until September 24, 2017.

On September 24, 2017, a representative of Citi called Mr. Matlin asking if MP CA Homes would support a business combination transaction
between CalAtlantic and Lennar. Mr. Matlin informed the representative of Citi that MP CA Homes would support a transaction at the right price, and
only if approved by the CalAtlantic board. Mr. Matlin contacted Mr. Stowell to notify him of the inquiry.

On September 25, 2017, representatives of Citi contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to inquire whether CalAtlantic would be receptive to an
all-stock business combination transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.89 shares of Lennar common stock per share of CalAtlantic common stock. In
addition, they communicated that Lennar desired to have discussions with representatives of MP CA Homes to explore creating an option to purchase
CalAtlantic shares held by MP CA Homes between the signing and closing of a definitive agreement. The representatives of J.P. Morgan referred the
representatives of Citi to the CalAtlantic board’s previous responses to Lennar’s prior proposals and the CalAtlantic board’s decision to terminate
discussions with Lennar. Later that day, representatives of Citi contacted representatives of J.P. Morgan to provide a revised proposal on behalf of
Lennar for an all-stock business combination transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.91 shares of Lennar common stock per share of CalAtlantic common
stock. At the request of Mr. Stowell, representatives of J.P. Morgan communicated Lennar’s proposal to the members of the CalAtlantic board.

On September 26, 2017, Mr. Beckwitt submitted a non-binding indication of interest letter to CalAtlantic and representatives of J.P. Morgan,
proposing a business combination transaction at a 0.91 exchange ratio (the “September 26 Proposal”), and indicating an expectation of, among other
matters, entering into a mutually satisfactory merger agreement, subject to completion of due diligence and other customary conditions, and assurances
of support for the transaction from MP CA Homes and a lock-up agreement. The closing price per share of CalAtlantic common stock and Lennar
Class A common stock on September 25, 2017, the last full trading day prior to Lennar’s submission of the September 26 Proposal, was $35.65 and
$50.53, respectively. As of such date, the exchange ratio of 0.91 represented an implied price per share of CalAtlantic common stock of approximately
$45.98 and a premium of approximately 29.0% to the price per share of CalAtlantic common stock.

On September 27, 2017, the CalAtlantic board held an in-person meeting to review the September 26 Proposal, with members of CalAtlantic
senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan attending in-person and representatives of Gibson Dunn attending telephonically. Representatives
of J.P. Morgan provided an overview of the September 26 Proposal, including as compared to Lennar’s previous proposals and to J.P. Morgan’s
preliminary analysis of the historical implied exchange ratios based on the relative trading prices of CalAtlantic common stock and Lennar common
stock. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also reviewed preliminary analyses of CalAtlantic’s competitive position relative to that of Lennar and other
companies in the U.S. homebuilding industry, and the potential value creation and risks associated with the September 26 Proposal

based on, among other factors, CalAtlantic management’s financial projections and synergy estimates. The CalAtlantic board also discussed with
representatives of J.P. Morgan other potential strategic transaction partners for the company. Members of CalAtlantic senior management also provided
their views on the September 26 Proposal in light of CalAtlantic’s standalone strategy. During executive session, without members of CalAtlantic senior
management or representatives of J.P. Morgan present, the CalAtlantic board engaged in extensive discussion regarding the September 26 Proposal
including, among other matters, the execution risks associated with a potential business combination transaction and CalAtlantic’s standalone plan and
strategy. Also during executive session, the CalAtlantic board discussed the possibility of CalAtlantic providing transaction-related payments to one or
more members of CalAtlantic senior management who were members of the pre-CalAtlantic Standard Pacific management team, if CalAtlantic were to
proceed with and complete a business combination transaction with Lennar, due to a perceived inequity with the change in control payments that would
be received by the members of CalAtlantic senior management who were members of the pre-CalAtlantic Ryland management team, because of legacy
change in control arrangements. Representatives of Gibson Dunn provided an overview of the process for negotiating and announcing entry into
definitive transaction documentation, including certain terms typically found in merger agreements involving public companies, and the terms proposed
by the September 26 Proposal letter. After further discussion, the CalAtlantic board determined, on the basis of the September 26 Proposal, to engage in
negotiating a potential business combination transaction with Lennar. Members of the CalAtlantic senior management and representatives of J.P.
Morgan then re-joined the meeting and the CalAtlantic board instructed members of the CalAtlantic senior management and representatives of J.P.
Morgan and Gibson Dunn to engage in negotiating a potential business combination transaction with Lennar.

On the evening of September 27, 2017, representatives of J.P. Morgan contacted representatives of Citi to communicate the CalAtlantic board’s
decision to proceed with mutual due diligence and with negotiating a potential business combination transaction with Lennar based upon the terms of
the September 26 Proposal. Also on September 27, 2017, Gibson Dunn distributed an initial draft of a confidentiality agreement, which contained a
customary mutual standstill provision, to Lennar’s legal advisor Goodwin Procter LLP, which we refer to as “Goodwin.”

Over the course of the next several days, members of CalAtlantic senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn
engaged in discussions with members of Lennar senior management and representatives of Citi and Goodwin to determine the process for due diligence
and negotiations.

On September 30, 2017, Mr. Beckwitt and Mr. Stowell discussed the draft confidentiality agreement and discussed Lennar’s desire to enter into an
agreement with MP CA Homes in which MP CA Homes would agree to vote for a business combination if one was approved by the CalAtlantic board
and would give Lennar an option to purchase MP CA Homes’ CalAtlantic shares for cash, which would enable Lennar to prevent the shares of Lennar
Class A common stock that MP CA Homes would receive in the business combination from creating an overhang on the market for Lennar Class A
common stock.

On October 1, 2017, a telephonic meeting was held with members of CalAtlantic senior management and representatives of J.P. Morgan and
Gibson Dunn and members of Lennar senior management and representatives of Citi and Goodwin, to discuss certain key components of a potential
transaction. Among the matters discussed on the call was Lennar’s desire to have a cash component to the proposed transaction and potential
mechanisms for Lennar to acquire the shares of CalAtlantic common stock owned by MP CA Homes for cash in order to effectuate this cash component.
In response to a statement by representatives of CalAtlantic that they did not want diligence to begin until an agreement between Lennar and MP CA
Homes was finalized, if such an agreement was a requirement for Lennar to proceed with a transaction, the representatives from Lennar stated that while
Lennar would like to enter into an agreement with MP CA Homes under which it would agree to receive cash consideration, this was not a requirement
to proceeding with a business combination transaction. The participants also discussed the possibility that Lennar would issue a dividend of its Class B
common stock in connection with the transaction. The discussions were reported to MP CA Homes by CalAtlantic.

On October 2, 2017, CalAtlantic and Lennar entered into a customary confidentiality agreement, which contained a customary mutual standstill
provision. Also on October 2, 2017, Goodwin distributed an initial draft of the merger agreement to Gibson Dunn.

During the following weeks, representatives of CalAtlantic and Lennar, and representatives of J.P. Morgan, Citi, Gibson Dunn and Goodwin, held
a series of calls and meetings in the course of performing due diligence on CalAtlantic and Lennar, respectively.

On October 10, 2017, Gibson Dunn distributed a revised draft of the merger agreement to Goodwin, which included, among other provisions, a
“go-shop” provision for the benefit of CalAtlantic with customary terms, an obligation of Lennar to pay a termination fee to CalAtlantic and reimburse
CalAtlantic for certain reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by CalAtlantic, in each case upon termination of the merger agreement
under certain specified circumstances, and an agreement for an unspecified number of members of the CalAtlantic board to serve on the Lennar board of
directors upon closing of the Merger. The revised draft also included significant revisions to the provisions providing the CalAtlantic board with the
ability to exercise its fiduciary duties in assessing alternative and superior proposals and changing its recommendation to stockholders with respect to
the Merger, including adding a right to do so upon the occurrence of certain intervening events.

On October 11 and 12, 2017, in-person due diligence meetings were held for CalAtlantic and Lennar to perform mutual due diligence, with
representatives of CalAtlantic management and Lennar management, and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Citi, attending. During these meetings, Mr.
Beckwitt informed Mr. Stowell that senior members of CalAtlantic management should expect their employment to terminate as of the closing date.

On October 13, 2017, Mr. Matlin and another representative of MP CA Homes had an in-person meeting with Messrs. Miller and Beckwitt and a
representative of Citi to discuss proposed terms of a voting and election agreement between MP CA Homes and Lennar, including a requirement that
MP CA Homes vote in support of the transaction, the terms of its post-closing lockup with regard to the Lennar shares that MP CA Homes would
receive as a result of a business combination between Lennar and CalAtlantic , and the terms under which MP CA Homes would be amenable to
accepting cash consideration for its shares of CalAtlantic common stock in the potential business combination transaction. Mr. Matlin communicated
that MP CA Homes was amenable to accepting cash consideration, on the right terms, but only if the cash component was available on the same terms to
all CalAtlantic stockholders. The parties agreed to consider the terms of the voting and election agreement and discuss again the following week.

On October 16, 2017, Goodwin distributed a revised draft of the merger agreement to Gibson Dunn, which, among other matters, did not include a
“go-shop” provision or a provision providing for members of the CalAtlantic board to serve on the Lennar board of directors, but which did include an
obligation of Lennar to pay a termination fee to CalAtlantic and to reimburse CalAtlantic for certain fees and expenses under some circumstances, in
addition to a reciprocal obligation of CalAtlantic to reimburse Lennar for certain fees and expenses.

On October 18, 2017, Mr. Matlin and another representative of MP CA Homes, Mr. Beckwitt and a representative of Citi met in New York to
discuss terms under which MP CA Homes would be amenable to accepting cash consideration for its shares of CalAtlantic common stock in connection
with a potential business combination transaction. Mr. Matlin communicated that MP CA Homes was amenable to accepting cash consideration for all
of its shares of CalAtlantic common stock at a 5% discount to the implied price per share of CalAtlantic common stock calculated the day prior to
announcement of the transaction based on a 0.91 exchange ratio. Lennar agreed to consider terms of the cash election component of the merger
consideration and to come back to MP CA Homes with a definitive proposal.

On October 20, 2017, Goodwin distributed to Gibson Dunn an initial draft of a voting agreement under which Mr. Miller and affiliated entities
would agree to vote all the Lennar stock they owned or had the power to

vote in favor of the proposed business combination with CalAtlantic. At the time, the shares Mr. Miller had the power to vote entitled the holders to cast
approximately 41.7% of the total number of votes that could be cast by Lennar stockholders.

On October 21, 2017, Gibson Dunn sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Goodwin. This revised draft proposed, among other matters, a
“go-shop” provision, termination fees payable by CalAtlantic to Lennar equal to 1.25 percent and 2.25 percent of the equity value of CalAtlantic if the
merger agreement was terminated under certain circumstances during the go-shop period and thereafter, respectively, and a termination fee payable by
Lennar to CalAtlantic equal to 4.0 percent of the equity value of CalAtlantic.

On October 22, 2017, Goodwin provided Gibson Dunn with Lennar’s list of open items on the merger agreement. This included a proposal for one
member of the CalAtlantic board to join the Lennar board of directors upon consummation of the transaction, elimination of the go shop right, three
matching rights in the event of a superior proposal, an obligation of the CalAtlantic board to provide an irrevocable termination notice before Lennar
would negotiate amending the terms of the merger agreement in the event of a superior proposal and a termination fee of 4.0 percent for each party.

On October 23, 2017, Mr. Stowell held a telephonic discussion with Mr. Beckwitt to discuss the status of negotiations, unresolved issues in the
draft merger agreement and potential terms for the cash consideration in the transaction. During this discussion, Mr. Beckwitt indicated that due to
recent changes in the price per share of Lennar Class A common stock relative to the price per share of CalAtlantic common stock, Lennar could no
longer agree to a transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.91 shares of Lennar Class A common stock for each share of CalAtlantic stock, and that Lennar
was instead prepared to agree to an exchange ratio of 0.87. Mr. Beckwitt stated that Lennar had satisfactorily completed its due diligence on CalAtlantic,
and the decrease in proposed price was not a result of any diligence findings. Mr. Stowell stated that he would take any revised proposal to the
CalAtlantic board, but that he expected an exchange ratio of 0.87 would not be well received by the CalAtlantic board, particularly if due diligence
supported Lennar’s prior assumptions on the contributions of CalAtlantic’s business to the combined company. The closing price per share of
CalAtlantic common stock and the Lennar Class A common stock on October 20, 2017, the last full trading day prior to Lennar’s revised proposal, was
$38.91 and $57.50, respectively. As of such date, an exchange ratio of 0.87 represented an implied price per share of CalAtlantic common stock of
approximately $50.02 and a premium of approximately 28.6% to the price per share of CalAtlantic common stock.

Also on October 23, 2017, representatives of Gibson Dunn had a telephonic meeting with representatives of Goodwin to discuss the draft merger
agreement.

Also on October 23, 2017, there was a conversation among Mr. Matlin, Mr. Beckwitt and a representative of Citi regarding the voting and cash
election agreement.

On October 24, 2017, Goodwin sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Gibson Dunn, which included, among other provisions, a cash
election mechanism permitting stockholders of CalAtlantic to elect, prior to the stockholder meetings, to receive cash consideration in the Merger in lieu
of shares of Lennar common stock, subject to a cap and proration as set forth in the draft merger agreement, the appointment of a member of the
CalAtlantic board to the Lennar board of directors upon consummation of the Merger, to be selected by the Lennar board of directors, and termination
fees payable by each of CalAtlantic and Lennar to the other equal to 4.0 percent of CalAtlantic equity value, without a “go-shop” provision.

On October 24, 2017 and October 25, 2017, there were a number of conversations between Mr. Beckwitt and Mr. Stowell regarding various
provisions of the proposed merger agreement, including provisions relating to deal protections, acceleration of equity awards to CalAtlantic employees
whose employment is terminated by Lennar, and cash election features of the proposed merger consideration.

During the period from September 27, 2017 through October 24, 2017, members of the CalAtlantic compensation committee discussed the
proposed retention agreements, including the advisability of retention agreements, which members of management would receive retention agreements,
the amount of the change in control payment expected to be received by each such officer under such officer’s then current change in control
arrangements, and the proposed amount of retention bonuses for each of Messrs. Stowell, McCall and Babel and Ms. Marlett, to eliminate any perceived
pay inequity.

On October 25, 2017 there was a meeting in New York among Mr. Matlin and another representative of MP CA Homes and Mr. Beckwitt and a
representative of Citi regarding the price Lennar would pay for shares it purchased from MP CA Homes.

On October 25, 2017, Mr. Stowell and Mr. Beckwitt had several conversations regarding the exchange ratio. Mr. Stowell told Mr. Beckwitt that
the CalAtlantic board of directors would not move forward on the basis of a 0.87 exchange ratio, but that he believed that the CalAtlantic board would
support a 0.90 exchange ratio. After extensive conversations, Mr. Stowell and Mr. Beckwitt tentatively agreed to present to their respective boards of
directors an exchange ratio of 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A common stock for each share of CalAtlantic common stock.

On October 25, 2017, the compensation committee of the CalAtlantic board met to consider and approve certain matters, including retention letter
agreements to be entered into by certain members of CalAtlantic senior management and CalAtlantic, and payments to the members of the Advisory
Committee for their service on the Advisory Committee. See the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of CalAtlantic Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 68 for a description of the retention letter agreements.

Also on October 25, 2017, the CalAtlantic board held a regularly scheduled telephonic meeting, with members of CalAtlantic senior management,
and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn, attending. During this meeting, Mr. Stowell provided an update on the status of negotiations with
Lennar regarding a potential business combination transaction, including Lennar’s recently revised proposal for a transaction at an exchange ratio of
0.885. Mr. Matlin also provided an update on discussions between Lennar and MP CA Homes with respect to proposed arrangements in which MP CA
Homes would agree to backstop a cash election for CalAtlantic stockholders in a transaction. Representatives of J.P. Morgan provided a preliminary
analysis of Lennar’s revised proposal, including as compared to Lennar’s prior proposal for a transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.91. Representatives of
J.P. Morgan also noted certain updates to their preliminary financial analysis including an increase in estimated synergies as provided by CalAtlantic
management based on further due diligence, Lennar’s proposed cash election to be supported by MP CA homes, as well as changes in market prices for
the stock of both CalAtlantic and Lennar. Representatives of J.P. Morgan further noted that their preliminary valuation analysis of Lennar on a
standalone and combined basis now incorporated prospective financial estimates provided by Lennar to CalAtlantic which were reviewed and adjusted
by CalAtlantic management and provided to J.P. Morgan. Also during this meeting, representatives of Gibson Dunn provided an overview of key terms
of, and unresolved issues in, the draft merger agreement, including regarding the “go-shop” provision, the magnitude of termination fees and the
circumstances under which these fees would paid and the ability of the CalAtlantic board to designate a director to serve on the Lennar board of
directors upon closing of the Merger. Representatives of Gibson Dunn also provided an overview of the proposed terms of the contemplated voting
agreements to be entered into by Mr. Miller and affiliated entities, and MP CA Homes, respectively. The CalAtlantic board determined that Mr. Stowell
should serve on the Lennar board of directors upon consummation of the Merger, in part because he would be able to provide continuity and an
understanding of the CalAtlantic business that would support a successful integration. The CalAtlantic board further determined, with the assistance of
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn, certain parameters for the magnitude of termination fees that would be acceptable, provided that
CalAtlantic’s financial and legal advisors negotiate to ensure the definitive merger agreement contained provisions relating to termination which were
more customary than those being proposed by Lennar at that time. The CalAtlantic board discussed proposing a termination fee of 2.25% for both
parties. After extensive discussion, the CalAtlantic board determined that it was in the best

interests of the stockholders of CalAtlantic to continue working with Lennar to reach a mutually agreed business combination transaction at an exchange
ratio of 0.885, with a cash election component, provided that certain other terms of the transaction be resolved favorably to CalAtlantic and that
definitive documentation be executed in the coming days. The CalAtlantic board also discussed with representatives of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn
the advisability and mechanics of a partial downside protection mechanism based on Lennar’s stock price. After the J.P. Morgan representatives left the
meeting, the CalAtlantic board received and considered, among other matters, a report from the compensation committee of the CalAtlantic board
regarding the matters approved by the compensation committee at its October 25, 2017 meeting described above.

On October 26, 2017, Mr. Stowell had a telephonic discussion with Mr. Beckwitt, to communicate the position of the CalAtlantic board and to
discuss certain open items with respect to a potential business combination transaction. Mr. Stowell told Mr. Beckwitt that the CalAtlantic board would
agree to a 0.885 exchange ratio, but wanted to include a ratcheting of the exchange ratio from 0.885 to 0.91 if the price of Lennar Class A common stock
declined below $57.94 down to $56.35, where the 0.91 exchange ratio would be locked. Mr. Beckwitt noted, among other matters, that Lennar would
not agree to a “go-shop” provision in the merger agreement or a termination fee of 2.25%.

Also on October 26, 2017, Gibson Dunn sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Goodwin, which included, among other provisions, a
termination fee payable by CalAtlantic to Lennar equal to 1.5% of the equity value of CalAtlantic if the merger agreement were terminated within thirty
days of the signing date, and equal to 4.0% of the equity value of CalAtlantic if the merger agreement were terminated thereafter. The revised draft did
not include a “go-shop” provision.

Also on October 26, 2017, Goodwin sent a draft of a voting and cash election agreement, to be entered into by Lennar and MP CA Homes, to MP
CA Home’s legal advisor Ropes & Gray LLP, which we refer to as “Ropes.”

On October 27, 2017, Mr. Beckwitt told Mr. Stowell Lennar would not agree to the downside protection of the 0.885 exchange ratio, and they
tentatively settled on a 0.885 exchange ratio, subject to the approval of their respective boards of directors. They also tentatively agreed that the
termination fee would be 3% of the equity value of the Merger on the day the agreement was signed. Mr. Stowell told Mr. Beckwitt that he understood
that MP CA Homes would not agree to a discount of more than 5% to the price per share of CalAtlantic stock implied by the 0.885 exchange ratio
immediately before the transaction is announced and that it did not want the cash option to apply to all its shares.

On October 28, 2017, representatives of Gibson Dunn had a telephonic meeting with representatives of Goodwin to discuss the draft merger
agreement. During October 28 and 29, 2019, Gibson Dunn and Goodwin exchanged revised drafts of, and had several discussions regarding, the merger
agreement.

Also on October 28, 2017, Mr. Matlin and Mr. Beckwitt had a telephonic meeting to discuss the terms on which MP CA Homes would make a
cash election. Following that call, Mr. Beckwitt told Mr. Stowell that unless MP CA Homes would agree to backstop a cash election option at a discount
of 6%, Lennar would not agree to a transaction. On October 29, 2017, there were a number of conversations among some or all of Mr. Beckwitt,
Mr. Matlin and Mr. Stowell, which resulted in agreement that the termination fee would be 2.95% of the equity value of the transaction, the cash election
option would be at $48.26 per share, which was 6% below the value of 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A based upon its most recent trading price, and that
provided that the terms of the merger agreement were acceptable to the CalAtlantic board, MP CA Homes would backstop that cash for up to 85 percent
of the shares of CalAtlantic held by MP CA Homes.

On the morning of October 29, 2017, the CalAtlantic board held a telephonic meeting, with members of CalAtlantic senior management, and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn, attending. Mr. Stowell provided an update on negotiations with Lennar, noting that while the proposed
exchange ratio remained 0.885,

certain other key terms of the merger agreement were resolved in favor of CalAtlantic. Representatives of Gibson Dunn noted for the CalAtlantic board
its fiduciary duties. Representatives of Gibson Dunn also provided an overview of key terms of the draft merger agreement, a draft of which had been
provided to the CalAtlantic board, including the terms relating to the ability of the CalAtlantic board to exercise its fiduciary duties in assessing
alternative and superior proposals and changing its recommendation to stockholders with respect to the Merger, and the proposed termination fee equal
to 2.95 percent of CalAtlantic equity value payable by each of CalAtlantic and Lennar to the other if the merger agreement were terminated under
certain specified circumstances. Representatives of Gibson Dunn also noted how such key terms had changed since being previously presented to the
CalAtlantic board. Mr. Matlin summarized the terms upon which MP CA Homes had agreed to backstop the cash election in the proposed transaction.
The CalAtlantic board determined to reconvene at a later time that day to further review the proposed transaction.

During the afternoon of October 29, 2017, Ropes and Goodwin exchanged drafts of the MP CA Homes’ voting and cash election agreement and
negotiated the final terms of such agreement.

Later on October 29, 2017, the CalAtlantic board reconvened and held a telephonic meeting, with members of CalAtlantic senior management,
and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Gibson Dunn, attending. Representatives of J.P. Morgan summarized the interactions with Lennar to date.
Representatives of J.P. Morgan also presented their financial analysis of the proposed transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.885 shares of Lennar
common stock for each share of CalAtlantic common stock, subject to a cash election mechanism such that approximately 20 percent of the aggregate
consideration could be in cash. J.P. Morgan then delivered to the CalAtlantic board its oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated October 29, 2017, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, the consideration to be paid to the holders of CalAtlantic
common stock in the Merger, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, as more fully described below in the section “The Merger—
Opinion of CalAtlantic’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 57 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The full text of the written opinion of J.P.
Morgan, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with
such opinion, is attached as Annex C hereto. Following discussion of the presentation by representatives of J.P. Morgan, J.P. Morgan’s delivery of its
oral opinion and review of proposed resolutions by Mr. Babel, and after deliberation and inquiry by the CalAtlantic board, the CalAtlantic board
unanimously determined, among other matters, that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of, CalAtlantic’s stockholders, and the CalAtlantic board adopted and approved the merger agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and recommended that the stockholders of CalAtlantic adopt the merger agreement and approve the
Merger.

Later on October 29, 2017, CalAtlantic and Lennar executed the definitive merger agreement. Mr. Miller and certain affiliated entities executed a
voting agreement with CalAtlantic. MP CA Homes executed a voting and cash election agreement with Lennar.

The transaction was announced pursuant to a joint press release issued by Lennar and CalAtlantic prior to market open on October 30, 2017.

The merger agreement provides that CalAtlantic and its representatives may interact with third parties that have submitted an alternative
acquisition proposal to clarify the terms and conditions of such proposal, and that CalAtlantic may furnish non-public information to third parties that
have submitted an alternative acquisition proposal that the CalAtlantic board determines in good faith constitutes, or is reasonably expected to result in,
a transaction that would be more favorable to CalAtlantic stockholders than the Merger, as described further under “The Merger Agreement –
Termination of the merger agreement.” As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, no person has made an alternative acquisition proposal to
acquire CalAtlantic.

Lennar Board Recommendation and Its Reasons for Approving the Merger

The Lennar board of directors has unanimously recommended that Lennar’s stockholders vote in favor of the Lennar Merger Proposal, the Lennar
Authorized Share Proposal and, if necessary, the Lennar Adjournment Proposal. In evaluating the Merger, the Lennar board of directors received
presentations from Lennar’s senior management and consulted with Lennar’s outside counsel, Goodwin Procter, LLP, and Lennar’s financial adviser,
Citigroup Global Markets. It considered a number of expected benefits of the Merger to Lennar and some negative aspects of the Merger. The factors
that Lennar’s board of directors considered included the following:

Expected Benefits of the Merger
 

 •  The merged companies would create a better platform for enhanced shareholder value.
 

 
•  The Merger is expected to be accretive to Lennar’s earnings per share by approximately $0.04 per share in fiscal year 2018, without taking

account of transaction costs, and to be accretive by approximately $0.68 per share to the earnings per share Lennar anticipated generating in
fiscal 2019 under a base plan that would have included effects of share repurchases.

 

 
•  The Merger will give Lennar significant concentrated local market share, with a top three market share position in 26 of the 30 fastest

growing metropolitan statistical areas, which will enable Lennar to have greater access to land and labor, leading to greater efficiencies and
opportunities.

 

 
•  The Merger will increase the areas where Lennar can become the builder of choice for subcontractors and suppliers, with resulting

reductions in cycle times, increases in inventory turns, and better access to skilled labor.
 

 •  Acquiring homebuilding operations in markets where we have local market and product knowledge will assist with a smooth integration.
 

 
•  The Merger is expected to result in approximately $100 million of cost savings in fiscal year 2018 and $365 million per year of cost savings

in fiscal year 2019 and subsequent years, as a result of reduced general and administrative costs and reduced homebuilding costs. The ability
to achieve these cost savings will result in part from the fact that Lennar and CalAtlantic have compatible product strategies.

 

 •  Acquiring existing communities with known absorption rates provides a foundation for growth in land constrained markets.
 

 
•  The Merger will expand synergies with non-homebuilding aspects of Lennar’s activities, such as residential mortgages and other financial

services and technology related partnerships and initiatives.
 

 

•  Although the Merger will require Lennar to incur or assume a substantial amount of additional debt, cash flow expected to be generated by
the combined company is anticipated to enable Lennar by the end of fiscal year 2019 to reduce its indebtedness to the point where the ratio
of its debt to total capital and the ratio of its net debt to total capital will be 36.0% and 33.3%, respectively, compared with 40.0% and
37.3%, respectively, which were expected to be the ratios at November 30, 2017 (which was before giving effect to the Merger or
indebtedness incurred in anticipation of the Merger).

 

 
•  Cash flow expected to be generated by the combined company will, in addition to enabling Lennar substantially to reduce its debt, enable

Lennar to engage in a stock repurchase program, with a resulting increase in earnings per share.
 

 

•  Lennar’s management demonstrated following the February 2017 acquisition of WCI Communities, Inc., and has demonstrated after other
acquisitions, that applying Lennar’s homebuilding techniques to properties accumulated by other homebuilders can accomplish cost savings
and increase gross margins. The combined company is expected to have the type of above average gross margins that have been consistently
achieved by Lennar for a number of years.

Table of Contents

 
•  Acquiring an existing homebuilding company gives Lennar access to already entitled land that can be developed without the delay involved

in obtaining entitlements.

Negative Aspects of the Merger
 

 
•  Partially because of transaction costs and integration costs, the Merger is expected to have only a small accretive effect on Lennar’s fiscal

year 2018 earnings per share.
 

 
•  Lennar will have to incur substantial indebtedness in connection with the Merger and to redeem or repay certain CalAtlantic debt shortly

after the Merger. Because of this, the Merger will significantly increase Lennar’s ratios of debt to total capital and net debt to total capital for
fiscal year 2018.

 

 
•  Because of the substantial amount of Lennar stock that will be issued in connection with the Merger, the return on Lennar’s equity and the

return on its capital will be lower during fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 than if Lennar did not do the Merger.
 

 
•  The Merger will result in a substantial amount of goodwill being recorded on Lennar’s balance sheet (the exact amount will depend on the

market price of Lennar’s stock and the fair value of CalAtlantic’s assets when the Merger is consummated).
 

 
•  Much of the expected benefit of the Merger depends on the ability of Lennar’s management to apply Lennar cost saving techniques to the

CalAtlantic operations.

Each director gave the various positive and negative considerations described above the relative weightings he or she believed appropriate.
Therefore, no particular considerations were given general priority over any other considerations.

Based upon the directors’ individual views of the Merger and related matters, the Lennar board of directors unanimously voted to
recommend that Lennar stockholders vote “FOR” the Lennar Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal and “FOR” the
Lennar Adjournment Proposal, if necessary, including to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the proposals at the
time of the Lennar special meeting.

CalAtlantic Board Recommendation and Its Reasons for the Merger

At its meeting on October 29, 2017, the CalAtlantic board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger. The CalAtlantic board of directors unanimously recommends that CalAtlantic stockholders vote “FOR”
each of the proposals being submitted to a vote of the CalAtlantic stockholders at the CalAtlantic special meeting.

The CalAtlantic board of directors considered many reasons in making its decision to recommend the adoption of the merger agreement and
approval of the transactions contemplated thereby. In arriving at its decision, the CalAtlantic board of directors consulted with CalAtlantic’s senior
management, and legal and financial advisors, reviewed a significant amount of information, considered a number of factors and concluded in its
business judgment that the proposed Merger is likely to result in significant strategic and financial benefits to CalAtlantic and its stockholders.

Strategic and Financial Benefits of Merger

In evaluating the Merger, the CalAtlantic board of directors considered a number of positive factors, including the following (not in any relative
order of importance):
 

 
•  a combination of CalAtlantic with Lennar would provide the long-term strategic benefit of creating a more diversified company, with

increased scope and scale of homebuilding activities, that would become the largest homebuilder in the United States by revenues;
 

54

Table of Contents

 

•  that CalAtlantic stockholders would own approximately 25% of Lennar following completion of the Merger, and that the transaction
consideration, comprised of Lennar common stock, with the ability to elect cash up to the maximum cash amount, provides immediate value
to the CalAtlantic stockholders and also provides the CalAtlantic stockholders with the opportunity to participate in the appreciation in value
that the CalAtlantic board of directors believes will be created as a result of the Merger;

 

 
•  the potential opportunities for greater operational efficiencies and synergies through conducting CalAtlantic’s and Lennar’s respective

operations as part of a single enterprise and the expectation that the CalAtlantic stockholders would benefit from such efficiencies and
synergies, including as a result of enhanced national and local market purchasing power as a result of increased scale;

 

 
•  the belief of the CalAtlantic board of directors that the consideration to be received by the CalAtlantic stockholders in the Merger was an

attractive offer in light of the recent and historical per share price performance of CalAtlantic common stock as compared to that of other
companies in the United States homebuilding industry including Lennar;

 

 

•  the expectation that combining the operations of CalAtlantic with Lennar would promote increased earnings per share (in comparison to
CalAtlantic on a stand-alone basis) through realization of synergies, cost savings and continuation of Lennar’s track-record of positive
performance; see the section entitled “Unaudited Prospective Financial Information—CalAtlantic Management’s Unaudited Prospective
Standalone Financial Information and the Synergies” beginning on page 63 for a description of such synergies and cost savings considered
by the CalAtlantic board;

 

 
•  the belief of the CalAtlantic board of directors that the strategic alternatives available to CalAtlantic, including the alternative of remaining a

standalone company, were less favorable to the CalAtlantic stockholders than the Merger given Lennar’s historical performance in the U.S.
homebuilding industry, and the potential risks, likely value creation, uncertainties and timing associated with these alternatives;

 

 
•  the prospects for Lennar following completion of the Merger given the CalAtlantic board of directors’ knowledge of each of CalAtlantic’s

and Lennar’s business, operations, financial condition, and earnings, taking into account Lennar’s publicly filed information and the results
of CalAtlantic’s due diligence review of Lennar;

 

 
•  the fact that Mr. Stowell, the current executive chairman of the CalAtlantic board of directors, would be expected to serve on the Lennar

board of directors upon completion of the Merger; and
 

 
•  the fact that the exchange ratio is fixed and will not fluctuate based upon changes in the market price of CalAtlantic common stock or

Lennar common stock between the date of the merger agreement and the date of the completion of the Merger.

Uncertainties, Risks and Potentially Negative Factors

In the course of its deliberations, the CalAtlantic board of directors also considered a variety of uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative
factors relevant to the transaction, including the following (not in any relative order of importance):
 

 
•  the potential negative effects on CalAtlantic’s business related to the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including the impact on

CalAtlantic’s employees and the potential for increased employee attrition and increased difficulty with employee recruitment;
 

 
•  the restrictions on the conduct of CalAtlantic’s business during the period between the execution of the merger agreement and the

completion of the Merger;
 

 
•  the costs associated with the completion of the Merger and the realization of the benefits expected to be obtained in connection with the

Merger, including management’s time and energy and potential opportunity cost;

Table of Contents

 
•  the challenges in absorbing the effect of any failure to complete the Merger, including potential termination fees, impact on CalAtlantic’s

business and stockholder and market reactions;
 

 •  the challenges inherent in the integration of two businesses of the size and complexity of CalAtlantic and Lennar;
 

 
•  the risk of not being able to realize all of the anticipated cost savings and operational synergies as a result of the Merger and the risk that

other anticipated benefits might not be realized;
 

 
•  the difficulties of combining the businesses and workforces of CalAtlantic and Lennar based on, among other things, differences in the

cultures of the two companies;
 

 
•  the right of the Lennar board of directors to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to CalAtlantic its recommendation to the Lennar

stockholders regarding the Merger, subject to Lennar paying CalAtlantic a termination fee of $178.7 million in the event that CalAtlantic
elects to terminate the merger agreement as a result;

 

 
•  the limited circumstances under which Lennar is required to pay CalAtlantic a termination fee of $178.7 million if the merger agreement is

terminated;
 

 
•  the risk that CalAtlantic stockholders or Lennar stockholders may object to and challenge the Merger and take actions that may prevent or

delay the consummation of the Merger, including to vote down the proposals at the CalAtlantic or Lennar special meetings;
 

 
•  the possibility, given trends in public merger transactions, of potential stockholder litigation, and the attendant costs, delays and diversion of

attention of management;
 

 

•  the fact that the merger agreement contains certain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging proposals for alternative acquisition
transactions involving CalAtlantic, including: (i) the restriction on CalAtlantic’s ability to solicit proposals for alternative transactions,
(ii) the limitations on the CalAtlantic board of directors’ ability to change its recommendation to CalAtlantic stockholders regarding the
Merger, (iii) the requirement that CalAtlantic notify Lennar of alternative acquisition proposals, and (iv) the requirement that CalAtlantic
pay a termination fee of $178.7 million to Lennar in certain circumstances following termination of the merger agreement;

 

 
•  the risk that CalAtlantic could be required to reimburse up to $30.0 million of Lennar’s reasonable, out-of-pocket transaction related fees

and expenses in the event that CalAtlantic stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement and approve the Merger;
 

 
•  the potential that the fixed exchange ratio under the merger agreement could result in Lennar delivering less value to the CalAtlantic

stockholders than had been anticipated by the CalAtlantic board of directors should the value of the shares of Lennar common stock
decrease from the date of the execution of the merger agreement; and

 

 
•  risks of the type and nature described under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning

on pages 26 and 36, respectively.

Further, the CalAtlantic board of directors considered that some members of the CalAtlantic board of directors and certain CalAtlantic executive
officers have interests in the proposed Merger as individuals that are in addition to, and that may be different from, the interest of the CalAtlantic
stockholders generally, as described under “The Merger—Interests of CalAtlantic Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on
page 68.

For the reasons set forth above and other reasons considered, the CalAtlantic board of directors unanimously determined that the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of CalAtlantic and its stockholders,
and unanimously adopted and approved, and declared advisable, the merger agreement. The CalAtlantic board of directors unanimously
recommends that the CalAtlantic stockholders vote “FOR” each of the proposals being submitted to a vote of the CalAtlantic stockholders at
the CalAtlantic special meeting.

Table of Contents

The foregoing discussion of the information and reasons considered by the CalAtlantic board of directors is not exhaustive but is intended to
reflect the material reasons considered by the CalAtlantic board of directors in its consideration of the Merger. In view of the complexity, and the large
number, of the reasons considered, the CalAtlantic board of directors, both individually and collectively, did not find it practicable to and did not attempt
to quantify or assign any relative or specific weight to the various reasons. Rather, the CalAtlantic board of directors based its recommendation on the
totality of the information presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual members of the CalAtlantic board of directors may have given
different weight to different reasons.

The foregoing discussion of the information and reasons considered by the CalAtlantic board of directors is forward-looking in nature. This
information should be read in light of the reasons described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page
36.

Based upon the directors’ individual views of the Merger and related matters, the CalAtlantic board of directors unanimously voted to
recommend that CalAtlantic stockholders vote “FOR” the CalAtlantic Merger Proposal, “FOR” the CalAtlantic Merger-Related
Compensation Proposal, and “FOR” the CalAtlantic Adjournment Proposal, if necessary, including adjournments to solicit additional proxies
if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the CalAtlantic special meeting.

Opinion of CalAtlantic’s Financial Advisor

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated September 15, 2017, CalAtlantic retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the
proposed Merger.

At the meeting of the CalAtlantic board on October 29, 2017, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the CalAtlantic board that, as of such date
and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan
in preparing the opinion, the consideration to be paid to the holders of CalAtlantic common stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point
of view, to such stockholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its October 29, 2017 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the CalAtlantic board,
dated October 29, 2017, that, as of such date, the consideration to be paid to the holders of CalAtlantic common stock in the proposed Merger was fair,
from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.

The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated October 29, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by J.P. Morgan in preparing the opinion, is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. CalAtlantic stockholders are urged to read
the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the CalAtlantic board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the
purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the consideration to be paid in the proposed Merger and did not address any
other aspect of the proposed Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors or other constituencies of CalAtlantic or as to the underlying decision by CalAtlantic to engage in the proposed Merger. The
issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of CalAtlantic as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.

In arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
 

 •  reviewed the merger agreement;
 

 
•  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning CalAtlantic and Lennar and the industries in which they

operate;

Table of Contents

 
•  compared the financial and operating performance of CalAtlantic and Lennar with publicly available information concerning certain other

companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of CalAtlantic common stock and Lennar
Class A common stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies;

 

 

•  reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of CalAtlantic and certain internal financial estimates
prepared by the management of Lennar relating to their respective businesses as described in the section titled, “Unaudited Prospective
Financial Information” in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as well as adjustments and extrapolations made by the management of
CalAtlantic to such projections or estimates of both businesses;

 

 
•  reviewed estimates of amounts and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and synergies expected to result from the proposed

Merger, which we refer to as the “Synergies,” as provided by the management of CalAtlantic based on their discussions with the
management of Lennar; and

 

 
•  performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the

purposes of its opinion.

In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of CalAtlantic and Lennar with respect to certain aspects of the
proposed Merger, and the past and current business operations of CalAtlantic and Lennar, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of
CalAtlantic and Lennar, the effects of the Merger on the financial condition and future prospects of CalAtlantic and Lennar, and certain other matters
J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.

In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was
furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by CalAtlantic and Lennar or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently
verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its engagement letter with CalAtlantic, J.P. Morgan did not assume any
obligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any
assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of CalAtlantic or Lennar under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, including the synergies, J.P. Morgan
assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to
the expected future results of operations and financial condition of CalAtlantic and Lennar to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan
expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts (including the synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that
the proposed Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal
income tax purposes, and will be consummated as described in the merger agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties
made by CalAtlantic and Lennar in the merger agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its
analysis. J.P. Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to CalAtlantic with respect to such issues.
J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the proposed
Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on CalAtlantic or Lennar or on the contemplated benefits of the proposed Merger.

The projections furnished to J.P. Morgan for CalAtlantic were prepared by CalAtlantic management, and the estimates for Lennar were prepared
by Lennar management and provided to CalAtlantic management, which subsequently reviewed, adjusted and approved such estimates prior to
providing them to J.P. Morgan. Neither CalAtlantic nor Lennar publicly discloses internal management projections or estimates of the type provided to
J.P. Morgan in connection with J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the proposed Merger, and such projections or estimates were not prepared with a view toward
public disclosure. These projections and estimates were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond
the control of management,

including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and prevailing interest rates. Accordingly, actual results
could vary significantly from those set forth in such projections or estimates. For more information regarding the use of such projections or estimates,
please refer to the section entitled “Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 63 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P.
Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion, and that J.P.
Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point
of view, of the consideration to be paid to the holders of CalAtlantic common stock in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion
as to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of CalAtlantic or the underlying
decision by CalAtlantic to engage in the proposed Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any
compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the consideration to
be paid to the holders of CalAtlantic common stock in the proposed Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan
expressed no opinion as to the price at which CalAtlantic common stock or Lennar Class A common stock will trade at any future time.

The terms of the merger agreement were determined through arm’s length negotiations between CalAtlantic and Lennar, and the decision to enter
into the merger agreement was solely that of the CalAtlantic board. J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors
considered by the CalAtlantic board in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the CalAtlantic
board or CalAtlantic management with respect to the proposed Merger or the consideration to be paid to the holders of CalAtlantic common stock in the
proposed Merger.

In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodology in rendering its
opinion to the CalAtlantic board on October 29, 2017 and in the presentation delivered to the CalAtlantic board on such date in connection with the
rendering of such opinion. The following is a summary of the material financial analyses utilized by J.P. Morgan in connection with rendering its
opinion to the CalAtlantic board and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the
summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more
fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set
forth below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the
analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.

Public Trading Multiples Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan compared selected financial data of CalAtlantic and Lennar
with similar data for selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be sufficiently analogous to the business of
CalAtlantic and Lennar or aspects thereof.

For CalAtlantic, the companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:
 

 •  D.R. Horton, Inc.
 

 •  Lennar Corporation
 

 •  PulteGroup, Inc.
 

 •  Toll Brothers, Inc.
 

 •  Taylor Morrison Home Corporation

 •  TRI Pointe Group, Inc.
 

 •  Meritage Homes Corporation

For Lennar, the companies selected by J.P. Morgan were as follows:
 

 •  D.R. Horton, Inc.
 

 •  PulteGroup, Inc.
 

 •  Toll Brothers, Inc.

None of the selected companies reviewed is identical to CalAtlantic or Lennar. These companies were selected, among other reasons, because they
are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of
CalAtlantic and Lennar. However, certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of CalAtlantic and
Lennar. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of
the companies involved and other factors that could affect the selected companies differently than they would affect CalAtlantic or Lennar.

Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the ratio of the company’s stock price to the respective
company’s latest available tangible book value (including book value of in-the-money convertible debt securities) divided by the number of diluted
shares, which we refer to as the “Price/Tangible Book Value,” and the ratio of the company’s stock price to the mean consensus equity research analyst
estimate for earnings per share for 2018, which we refer to as the “Price/2018E EPS”.

Based on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan selected multiple reference ranges for Price/Tangible Book Value of 1.3x – 1.8x for CalAtlantic
and 1.6x – 2.3x for Lennar and multiple reference ranges for Price/2018E EPS of 9.5x – 12.5x for CalAtlantic and 11.0x – 14.0x for Lennar.

After applying such ranges to the respective tangible book value per share provided by management, the mean consensus research analyst estimate
for earnings per share for 2018 and the estimated management earnings per share for 2018, in each case, with respect to CalAtlantic and Lennar, the
analysis indicated the following implied per share equity value ranges for CalAtlantic common stock and Lennar Class A common stock, rounded to the
nearest $0.25:
 

   
Implied Per Share

Equity Value  
   Low    High  
CalAtlantic     
Price/Tangible Book Value   $39.00   $53.75 
Price/2018E EPS (Consensus)   $38.25   $50.50 
Price/2018E EPS (CalAtlantic Management)   $46.25   $60.75 
Lennar     
Price/Tangible Book Value   $50.50   $72.50 
Price/2018E EPS (Consensus)   $53.25   $68.00 
Price/2018E EPS (Lennar Management)   $56.00   $71.25 

The ranges of implied per share equity values for CalAtlantic common stock were compared to CalAtlantic’s closing share price of $40.45 on
October 27, 2017, the proposed cash consideration of $48.26 per share of CalAtlantic common stock and the implied offer price of $51.34 per share of
CalAtlantic common stock at the proposed stock consideration exchange ratio of 0.885 per share based on Lennar’s closing share price of $58.01 on
October 27, 2017.

The ranges of implied per share equity values for Lennar Class A common stock were compared to Lennar’s closing share price of $58.01 on
October 27, 2017.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted
equity value per share for CalAtlantic common stock and Lennar Class A common stock. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an
asset using estimates of the future unlevered cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value of money with respect to
those cash flows by calculating their “present value.” The “unlevered free cash flows” refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated by an
asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. “Present value” refers to the current value of the cash flows generated by the asset,
and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and
estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital and other appropriate factors. “Terminal value” refers to the present value of all future cash flows
generated by the asset for periods beyond the periods indicated above.

J.P. Morgan calculated the unlevered free cash flows that each of CalAtlantic and Lennar is expected to generate during the period from the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2017 through the end of 2022 based upon financial projections and extrapolations without Synergies prepared by CalAtlantic
management and financial estimates without Synergies prepared by Lennar management and provided to CalAtlantic management, which subsequently
reviewed, adjusted and approved such projections or estimates. In particular, for the purposes of developing the discounted cash flow valuation, terminal
year projections or estimates for both CalAtlantic and Lennar were developed, reviewed and approved by CalAtlantic management. J.P. Morgan also
calculated a range of terminal values of each of CalAtlantic and Lennar at the end of the 5.25-year period ending 2022 by applying a perpetual growth
rate ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% to the unlevered free cash flow of each company during the terminal period. The unlevered free cash flows and the
range of terminal values were then discounted to present values as of September 30, 2017 for CalAtlantic and August 31, 2017 for Lennar using a range
of discount rates from 7.75% to 8.75%. This discount rate range was based upon J.P. Morgan’s analysis of the weighted-average cost of capital of each
of CalAtlantic and Lennar.

Based on the foregoing, this analysis indicated the following implied per share equity value range, rounded to the nearest $0.25, for CalAtlantic
common stock and Lennar Class A common stock:
 

   
Implied Per Share

Equity Value  
   Low    High  
CalAtlantic     
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis   $45.75   $59.75 
Lennar     
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis   $55.75   $68.75 

The range of implied per share equity values for CalAtlantic common stock was compared to CalAtlantic’s closing share price of $40.45 on
October 27, 2017, the proposed cash consideration of $48.26 per share of CalAtlantic common stock and the implied offer price of $51.34 per share of
CalAtlantic common stock at the proposed stock consideration exchange ratio of 0.885 per share based on Lennar’s closing share price of $58.01 on
October 27, 2017.

The range of implied per share equity values for Lennar Class A common stock was compared to Lennar’s closing share price of $58.01 on
October 27, 2017.

Relative Value Analysis. Based upon the implied valuations for each of CalAtlantic and Lennar as derived above under “Public Trading Multiples
Analysis” and “Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,” J.P. Morgan calculated a range of implied exchange ratios of a share of CalAtlantic common stock to a
share of Lennar Class A common stock, and then compared that range of implied exchange ratios to the proposed stock consideration exchange ratio.

For each of the analyses referred to above, J.P. Morgan calculated the ratio implied by dividing the low end of each range of implied equity values
of CalAtlantic by the high end of each range of implied equity values of

Lennar. J.P. Morgan also calculated the ratio implied by dividing the high end of each range of implied equity values of CalAtlantic by the low end of
each range of implied equity values of Lennar.

In each case, the implied exchange ratios were compared to the proposed stock consideration exchange ratio of 0.885x and did not include any
Synergies. This analysis indicated the following implied exchange ratios:

Miscellaneous. The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data
presented by J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing
summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the
analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were
merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value
of CalAtlantic or Lennar. The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In
arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to
whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan
considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.

Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of
the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be
appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected companies reviewed as
described in the above summary is identical to CalAtlantic or Lennar. The companies were selected, among other reasons, because they are publicly
traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of CalAtlantic and
Lennar. However, certain of these companies may have characteristics that are materially different from those of CalAtlantic and Lennar. The analyses
necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved
and other factors that could affect the companies compared to CalAtlantic and Lennar.

As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions
of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise CalAtlantic with
respect to the proposed Merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters
and its familiarity with CalAtlantic, Lennar and the industries in which they operate.

CalAtlantic has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a fee of $40.0 million, $0.3 million of which became payable to J.P. Morgan for advisory services
rendered up until the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion, $4.0 million of

which became payable to J.P. Morgan at the time J.P. Morgan delivered its opinion and the remainder of which is contingent and payable upon the
consummation of the proposed Merger. In addition, CalAtlantic has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred in connection with its
services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s
engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking
relationships with CalAtlantic and Lennar, for which J.P. Morgan and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such
period have included acting as joint lead arranger and joint lead bookrunner on CalAtlantic’s credit facility in October 2015, as lead-left bookrunner on
an offering of debt securities by CalAtlantic in May 2016, as active bookrunner on a sale of equity securities of CalAtlantic in June 2017 (representing
MP CA Homes), and as joint bookrunner on an offering of debt securities by CalAtlantic in June 2017; as joint bookrunner on offerings of debt
securities by Lennar in October 2015, February 2016 and April 2017, as lead left bookrunner on an offering of debt securities by Lennar in January
2017, and as sole bookrunner and joint lead arranger on Lennar’s credit facility in June 2016 and May 2017. In addition, during such period, J.P. Morgan
and its affiliates have provided loan syndication, and debt and equity underwriting services to portfolio companies of MatlinPatterson Global Advisers
LLC, which portfolio companies are unrelated to the proposed Transaction. In addition, J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and
a lender under outstanding credit facilities of CalAtlantic, Lennar and such portfolio companies as are referred to in the preceding sentence, for which it
receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the
outstanding common stock of each of CalAtlantic and Lennar. During the two year period ending on September 30, 2017, the aggregate fees received by
J.P. Morgan from CalAtlantic were approximately $7 million and from Lennar were approximately $7 million. In the ordinary course of their businesses,
J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments of CalAtlantic or Lennar for their own accounts or
for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

CalAtlantic Management’s Unaudited Prospective Standalone Financial Information and the Synergies

CalAtlantic does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose financial forecasts, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying
assumptions and estimates. In connection with CalAtlantic’s consideration and negotiation of a potential transaction with Lennar, in August 2017,
CalAtlantic management prepared certain non-public, unaudited internal financial forecasts for CalAtlantic on a standalone basis, for fiscal years 2017
through 2019 regarding CalAtlantic’s revenue, gross margin percent, net income, and earnings per share which we refer to as “EPS.” We refer to these
financial forecasts collectively as the “CalAtlantic Financial Forecasts.” In addition, CalAtlantic management extrapolated the CalAtlantic Financial
Forecasts (other than EPS) for fiscal years 2020 through 2022 based on CalAtlantic management’s assumptions regarding industry growth and stage of
the homebuilding cycle expected during such period. We refer to such extrapolated financial forecasts as the “CalAtlantic Extrapolations,” and we refer
to the CalAtlantic Financial Forecasts and the CalAtlantic Extrapolations together as the “CalAtlantic Projections.” CalAtlantic management also
prepared the Synergies. The Synergies are calculated as cost savings from synergies, net of related synergy implementation costs, and were prepared
based on discussions with Lennar management assuming a phase-in of such synergies through fiscal year 2019. The CalAtlantic Projections were
prepared based on a stand-alone capital plan for CalAtlantic, including assumptions regarding CalAtlantic’s plans for future share repurchases, debt
financings and dividend policies. CalAtlantic provided the CalAtlantic Projections and the Synergies to J.P. Morgan and the CalAtlantic board of
directors. As a result, CalAtlantic has included below a summary of the CalAtlantic Projections and the Synergies to provide its stockholders access to
certain formerly non-public information that was considered by the CalAtlantic board of directors and J.P. Morgan in connection with its financial
analysis. In connection with the due diligence review of CalAtlantic by Lennar, CalAtlantic’s management also provided certain of the CalAtlantic
Projections for fiscal years 2017 through 2019 to Lennar and its financial advisor.

The CalAtlantic Projections include revenue, gross margin, net income, and EPS for CalAtlantic on a standalone basis. Unlevered free cash flow
was also calculated based on the CalAtlantic Projections. Unlevered free cash flow refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated by an asset
without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs.

A summary of the CalAtlantic Projections discussed above, which includes both the CalAtlantic Financial Forecasts for fiscal years 2017 through
2019 and the CalAtlantic Extrapolations for fiscal years 2020 through 2022, is presented below:

J.P. Morgan’s discounted cash flow analysis in connection with its opinion delivered to the CalAtlantic board of directors on October 29, 2017. J.P.
Morgan’s Unlevered Free Cash Flow calculation was provided to CalAtlantic management, which subsequently reviewed and approved such

Summary of CalAtlantic’s Adjustments to Lennar Standalone Financial Estimates

Lennar has never prepared multi-year projections. The only projections Lennar prepares in the ordinary course are projections for the forthcoming
fiscal year, prepared at the beginning of that fiscal year, which are not disclosed to the public. With regard to 2018, by the time the merger agreement
was signed, Lennar had not completed its budgeting process for 2018, and therefore did not yet have fiscal 2018 projections. However, at the request of
CalAtlantic, Lennar provided to CalAtlantic, for use in the course of its due diligence, non-public estimates by Lennar personnel of future operating
results and financial condition based on preliminary divisional business plans for fiscal years 2017 through 2022, which we refer to as the “Lennar
Financial Estimates.” The Lennar Financial Estimates did not constitute projections and were not subject to the type of detailed analysis that would be
involved in the preparation of projections. Also, the Lennar Financial Estimates were prepared before Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and did not reflect
resulting deferrals of home deliveries which had been

expected in fiscal 2017. CalAtlantic management reviewed the Lennar Financial Estimates in connection with its diligence, but for purposes of
providing the estimates to J.P. Morgan for use in its financial analyses, rather than using the Lennar Financial Estimates for fiscal years 2020 through
2022, CalAtlantic’s management extrapolated Lennar’s estimates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 to prepare forecasts for fiscal years 2020 through 2022,
with such extrapolations based on the same assumptions used by CalAtlantic’s management in preparing the CalAtlantic Extrapolations regarding the
industry’s long term average growth. We refer to the Lennar Financial Estimates, as adjusted by CalAtlantic’s management, as the “Adjusted Lennar
Financial Estimates.” The Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates were provided to J.P. Morgan and the CalAtlantic board of directors.

The following sets forth the EPS estimates, provided by Lennar for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, and the unlevered free cash flow prepared based
on the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates as described above. The unlevered free cash flow calculation includes financials for Lennar’s Homebuilding
and Financial Services segments only, and excludes Lennar’s ownership of Rialto and Multifamily businesses, as well as unconsolidated joint ventures.
Such businesses and investments were valued separately. The following unlevered free cash flow calculations are based on the unadjusted Lennar
Financial Estimates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates for fiscal years 2020 through 2022:

EPS      5.08    5.86       
 
(1) The estimated terminal unlevered free cash flow of Lennar was $1,306 million. Unlevered Free Cash Flow (including such estimated terminal

unlevered free cash flow) was calculated by J.P. Morgan based on the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s
discounted cash flow analysis in connection with its opinion delivered to the CalAtlantic board of directors on October 29, 2017. J.P. Morgan’s
Unlevered Free Cash Flow calculation was provided to CalAtlantic management, which subsequently reviewed and approved such projections.

The CalAtlantic Projections, the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates and the Synergies are subjective in many respects and, thus, subject to
interpretation. Although presented with numeric specificity, the CalAtlantic Projections, the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates and the Synergies
reflect numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to industry performance and competition, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions, matters specific to CalAtlantic’s and Lennar’s businesses, and the effects of the Merger as they relate to the Synergies including the factors
set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 26, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond CalAtlantic’s or
Lennar’s control. CalAtlantic cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions underlying the CalAtlantic Projections, the Adjusted Lennar Financial
Estimates or the Synergies will be realized.

Many of the assumptions reflected in the CalAtlantic Projections, the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates and the Synergies are subject to change
and such projections and estimates do not reflect revised prospects for CalAtlantic’s or Lennar’s business as a result of the Merger, changes in general
business or economic conditions or any other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated at the time such
financial information was prepared. Important factors that may affect actual results or the achievability of the projections or estimates include, but are
not limited to, those risks and uncertainties described in CalAtlantic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and
Lennar’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016, as well as those set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors” in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus beginning on page 26. CalAtlantic has not updated and does not intend to update or otherwise revise the CalAtlantic
Projections, the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates or the Synergies. There can be no assurance that the results reflected in any of the CalAtlantic
Projections, the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates or the Synergies will be realized or that actual results will not materially differ from

such projections and estimates. In addition, the CalAtlantic Projections and the Synergies cover multiple years and such information by its nature
becomes less predictive with each successive year. Therefore, the CalAtlantic Projections and the Synergies included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus should not be relied on as necessarily predictive of actual future events nor construed as financial guidance.

CalAtlantic stockholders and Lennar stockholders are urged to review CalAtlantic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016 and Lennar’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016 and CalAtlantic’s and Lennar’s
subsequently filed reports with the SEC for descriptions of risk factors with respect to CalAtlantic’s and Lennar’s businesses. You should read
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 36, “Risk Factors” beginning on page 26, and “Where You Can
Find More Information” beginning on page 133 for additional information regarding the risks inherent in forward-looking information such as the
CalAtlantic Projections and the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates.

The CalAtlantic Projections, the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates and the Synergies were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure
but rather for the purpose of evaluating the proposed transaction between CalAtlantic and Lennar. Accordingly, the CalAtlantic Projections, the Adjusted
Lennar Financial Estimates and the Synergies do not comply with GAAP (including because certain metrics are non-GAAP measures, and such
projections and estimates do not include footnote disclosures as may be required by GAAP), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections
or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial
information. The CalAtlantic Projections, the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates and the Synergies have been prepared by, and are the responsibility
of CalAtlantic’s management. Neither CalAtlantic’s nor Lennar’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants,
have audited, compiled, examined, reviewed or performed any agreed-upon procedures with respect to the CalAtlantic Projections, the Adjusted Lennar
Financial Estimates or the Synergies, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such projections or estimates or the
achievability of the results reflected in such projections or estimates, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, such
projections or estimates. The report of CalAtlantic’s independent registered public accounting firm incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus relates only to CalAtlantic’s historical financial information and no such report extends to the prospective financial information or
should be read to do so. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented
in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures such as those used in the CalAtlantic Projections, the Adjusted Lennar Financial
Estimates and the Synergies may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies or persons. The non-GAAP financial measures
set forth above should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.

For the reasons described above, readers of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the
CalAtlantic Projections, the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates and the Synergies. Neither CalAtlantic nor Lennar has made any representation to the
other in the merger agreement concerning any such projections or estimates.

The CalAtlantic Projections and the Adjusted Lennar Financial Estimates do not give effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement or any changes to Lennar’s operations or strategy that may be implemented after the completion of the Merger, including any
potential synergies expected to be realized as a result of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to any disruption
to CalAtlantic’s or Lennar’s business caused by the announcement of the Merger, or to any costs related to, or that may arise in connection with, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the effect of any failure of the Merger to occur.

THE PERIOD BETWEEN THAT DATE AND THE DATE OF THIS JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, OR TO REFLECT THE
OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH
FORECASTS ARE NOT BEING REALIZED.

Board of Directors and Executive Officers of Lennar After Completion of the Merger

The persons who currently are the Lennar directors and executive officers are expected to continue as Lennar directors and executive officers after
the Merger. The current members of the Lennar board are Irving Bolotin, Steven L. Gerard, Theron I. (“Tig”) Gilliam, Sherrill W. Hudson, Sidney
Lapidus, Teri McClure, Stuart Miller, Armando Olivera, Donna Shalala and Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. The merger agreement provides that effective at the
time of the Merger, Scott D. Stowell, who currently is the Executive Chairman of CalAtlantic, will be added to the Lennar board.

Information about Lennar’s current directors and executive officers is contained in Lennar’s Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
November 30, 2016 and the proxy statement dated March 7, 2017 relating to Lennar’s 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Information about Scott
Stowell is contained in CalAtlantic’s proxy statement dated March 31, 2017 relating to CalAtlantic’s 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Lennar
Report on Form 10-K and the Lennar and CalAtlantic proxy statements all are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See
“Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 133.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

In accordance with GAAP, Lennar will account for the Merger using the acquisition method of accounting, with Lennar being considered the
acquiror of CalAtlantic for accounting purposes. This means that Lennar will allocate the purchase price to the fair value of CalAtlantic’s tangible and
intangible assets and liabilities at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price, if any, being recorded as goodwill. Under the acquisition method
of accounting, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

Lennar and CalAtlantic have determined that the Merger is not subject to the filing requirements of the HSR Act, and no other filings, approvals
or consents from federal or state antitrust authorities are required in order to consummate the Merger. The Merger may require that notifications be
given to governmental agencies that have issued licenses that are held by CalAtlantic and its subsidiaries and other governmental agencies.

The shares of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock that will be issued to CalAtlantic stockholders as a result of the Merger must be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

Restrictions on Sales of Shares of Lennar Class A and Class B Common Stock Received in the Merger

Except as set forth below, all shares of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock received by CalAtlantic stockholders as a result of the Merger
will be freely tradable for purposes of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act unless CalAtlantic stockholders to whom shares are issued are
“affiliates” of Lennar, which Lennar does not believe will be the case, except possibly with regard to Scott Stowell, who will become a director of
Lennar. If any CalAtlantic stockholder is an affiliate of Lennar, this joint proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of shares received as a result
of the Merger.

MP CA Homes has agreed in a Voting and Cash Election Agreement, dated October 29, 2017 between MP CA Homes and Lennar, which we refer
to as the “MP CA Homes Agreement,” that if as a result of the Merger, it receives 5% or more of the Lennar Class A common stock that will be
outstanding immediately after the Merger, until 90 days after the Merger becomes effective, MP CA Homes will not sell or otherwise transfer

any shares of Lennar Class A common stock. After that, there will be no restriction under the MP CA Homes Agreement against MP CA Homes’ selling
or otherwise transferring Lennar common stock.

No Appraisal Rights

Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to
demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration
being paid or issued to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction.

Appraisal rights are not available in all circumstances, and exceptions to these rights are provided under the DGCL. Section 262 of the DGCL
provides that stockholders have the right, in some circumstances, to dissent from certain corporate actions and to instead demand payment of the fair
value of their shares. Stockholders do not have appraisal rights with respect to shares of any class or series of stock if such shares of stock, or depositary
receipts in respect thereof, are either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders, unless the stockholders
are required to receive in exchange for their shares anything other than shares of stock of the surviving or resulting corporation (or depositary receipts in
respect thereof), or of any other corporation that is publicly listed or held by more than 2,000 holders of record, cash in lieu of fractional shares or
fractional depositary receipts described above or any combination of the foregoing. Therefore, because CalAtlantic stockholders are not required to
accept in the Merger any consideration in exchange for their shares of CalAtlantic common stock other than Lennar Class A common stock and Class B
common stock, both of which are listed on the NYSE, and cash in lieu of fractional shares (if applicable), holders of CalAtlantic common stock will not
be entitled to any appraisal rights in connection with the Merger with respect to their shares of CalAtlantic common stock.

NYSE Listing of Lennar Stock; Delisting and Deregistration of CalAtlantic Common Stock

It is a condition to the obligations of each party to complete the Merger that the shares of Lennar stock to be issued in the Merger have been
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to notice of issuance. Lennar is required to use its reasonable best efforts to cause all the conditions to the
parties’ obligations (which includes the condition regarding approval for listing on the NYSE) to be fulfilled.

If the Merger is completed, CalAtlantic’s common stock will cease to be listed on the NYSE and its registration under the Exchange Act will be
terminated.

Interests of CalAtlantic Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the CalAtlantic board of directors that you vote to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that
CalAtlantic’s executive officers and directors have economic interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of CalAtlantic’s
stockholders generally. CalAtlantic’s board of directors was aware of and considered those interests, among other matters, in reaching its decisions to
(i) approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, (ii) adopt, approve and declare advisable the merger
agreement, and (iii) resolve to recommend the approval of the merger agreement to CalAtlantic stockholders. The transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement will be a “change in control” for purposes of the CalAtlantic executive compensation arrangements described below.

Certain Assumptions

Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the following
assumptions were used:
 

 
•  The value of the per share merger consideration is $49.13 for each CalAtlantic share based on the average closing price per CalAtlantic

share over the five business days following the first public announcement of the transaction on October 30, 2017.

Table of Contents

 
•  The effective time is November 1, 2017, which is the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this

section.
 

 
•  Each executive officer of CalAtlantic was terminated by CalAtlantic without “cause” or resigned for “good reason” (as such terms are

defined in the relevant agreements) in connection with the Merger, in either case immediately following the assumed effective time of
November 1, 2017.

Change in Control and Severance Arrangements

Following is a description of the severance and change in control arrangements between CalAtlantic and each named executive officer.

Change of Control Arrangements with Mr. Nicholson.

Mr. Nicholson, CalAtlantic’s Chief Executive Officer and President, has entered into two severance agreements with CalAtlantic, an executive
severance agreement and a CEO severance agreement. Severance payments to Mr. Nicholson in connection with a qualifying termination within a
“change of control period” may be made pursuant to either the CEO severance agreement or the executive severance agreement, whichever would
convey the greater economic benefit to Mr. Nicholson, but not both.

Pursuant to the executive severance agreement, during a “change of control period,” if Mr. Nicholson’s employment is terminated without “cause”
or if Mr. Nicholson resigns for “good reason,” Mr. Nicholson will have the right to receive: (i) a pro rata bonus through the date of termination based on
the target annual bonus for the year in which termination occurs or in the absence of a specified target annual bonus for that year, the highest bonus he
earned in any of the three years prior to termination, plus an amount equal to two times the highest “annual compensation” paid to him for any of the
three years prior to termination, (ii) acceleration and payment of any outstanding equity and incentive awards, (iii) participation in the life, accident and
health insurance, employee welfare benefit and executive medical reimbursement plans in which he currently participates at the sole cost of CalAtlantic
for a period of two years following his termination of employment, (iv) a lump sum cash payment for two years of continued participation in the
personal health and services allowance provided to him prior to the change of control, (v) reimbursement for the costs of relocating in order to pursue
professional or career opportunities within two years after termination, including taxes payable on the reimbursement, any costs or commissions related
to selling his home, and all moving expenses and any other benefits provided by CalAtlantic under its relocation program, and (vi) reimbursement for
outplacement services used within two years of the date of termination of up to 25% of his annual compensation for the calendar year prior to the date of
termination or, in lieu of such reimbursement, a lump sum cash payment equal to 10% of his “annual compensation” for the calendar year immediately
preceding termination of employment. “Annual compensation” means the sum of Mr. Nicholson’s annual base salary and bonus paid or earned (even if
paid in a subsequent year), and all amounts credited to him, vested and unvested, under any incentive compensation or other benefit or compensation
plan, including long-term and equity incentive award plans during the year.

Pursuant to the CEO severance agreement, if Mr. Nicholson’s employment is terminated without “cause,” Mr. Nicholson will have the right to
receive: (i) a pro rata share of his annual bonus incentive payment for the year in which the termination occurs and payment of all benefits to which he
has a vested right at the time of termination, (ii) a lump sum cash payment equal to the aggregate amount of 24 months of his annual base salary as in
effect prior to the date of notice of termination, (iii) a lump sum cash payment equal to two times the highest amount of annual bonus incentive payment
paid or payable in the three previous years prior to the year of termination, (iv) an equity award equal to the highest restricted stock unit award granted
during the three previous years (or a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares if such award cannot be made),
(v) acceleration and payment of any outstanding equity and incentive awards, (vi) continued participation in the life, medical, dental, vision, AD&D,
prescription drug, and long-term disability programs in which he participates prior to termination for a period of two years following termination of
employment or equivalent benefits for the same period, and (vii) a lump sum cash payment equal to the value of

coverage under the executive life insurance program as well as the value of the personal health services allowance for a period of 24 months.

Change in Control Protection Agreement with Mr. Stowell.

Mr. Stowell, CalAtlantic’s Executive Chairman, is a party to a severance and change in control protection agreement with CalAtlantic. Under this
agreement, if his employment with CalAtlantic is terminated without “cause” (cause generally consisting of various bad acts described more particularly
in the agreement) or by Mr. Stowell for “good reason” (generally consisting of adverse changes in responsibilities, compensation, benefits or location of
work place) in connection with a change in control (i.e., “double-trigger” required for payouts), he is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to
three times the sum of his current base salary plus his target bonus for the year of termination, COBRA paid by CalAtlantic for three years and an
additional pro-rata bonus. The amount of the pro-rata bonus is determined by multiplying his target bonus for the year of termination by the quotient
obtained by dividing the number of days in the year up to and including the date of termination by 365. In addition, all unvested equity awards will vest
as of the date of termination.

Change of Control and Severance Arrangement with Mr. Skelly. Mr. Skelly has entered into an executive severance agreement with CalAtlantic.
Pursuant to this agreement, in the event that his employment is terminated by CalAtlantic without “cause” or Mr. Skelly resigns for “good reason”
during a “change of control period,” Mr. Skelly will have the right to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to a pro rata bonus through the date of
termination based on the target annual bonus for the year in which termination occurs or in the absence of a specified target annual bonus for that year,
the highest bonus earned by him in any of the last three years prior to termination, plus an amount equal to two times the highest “annual compensation”
paid to him for any of the three years prior to termination. In addition to these benefits, upon a qualifying termination, he will have the right to receive
(i) acceleration and payment of any outstanding equity and incentive awards, (ii) participation in the life, accident and health insurance, employee
welfare benefit and executive medical reimbursement plans in which he then participates at the sole cost of CalAtlantic for a period of two years
following termination of employment, (iii) a lump sum cash payment for two years of continued participation in the personal health and services
allowance provided to him prior to the change of control, (iv) reimbursement for the costs of relocating in order to pursue professional or career
opportunities within two years after termination, including taxes payable on the reimbursement, any costs or commissions related to selling his home,
and all moving expenses and any other benefits provided by CalAtlantic under its relocation program, and (v) the right to receive reimbursement for
outplacement services used within two years of the date of termination of up to 25% of his “annual compensation” for the calendar year prior to the date
of termination or, in lieu of such reimbursement, a lump sum cash payment equal to 10% of his “annual compensation” for the calendar year
immediately preceding termination of employment. Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, CalAtlantic entered into an amendment of
this executive severance agreement with Mr. Skelly to provide that, in the event that Mr. Skelly’s employment is terminated in a manner entitling him to
outplacement benefits, in lieu of such benefits Mr. Skelly will be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the maximum amount he could
have been reimbursed for under the executive severance agreement. This amendment is contingent upon the Merger having been consummated prior to
December 31, 2018, and will be null and void if the Merger is not consummated by that date.

The “change of control period” for Mr. Skelly’s executive severance agreement begins on the date CalAtlantic (or a successor) becomes aware of
or enters into discussions or negotiations that could involve a “change of control” and ends on the earlier of two years after the effective date of a
“change of control” or the date on which a “change of control” is no longer discussed or proposed to occur. For purposes of his executive severance
agreement, “annual compensation” means the sum of Mr. Skelly’s annual base salary and bonus paid or earned (even if paid in a subsequent year), and
all amounts credited to him, vested and unvested, under any incentive compensation or other benefit or compensation plan, including long-term and
equity incentive award plans during the year.

Change in Control and Severance Protection Agreement with Jeff McCall, Wendy Marlett and John P. Babel. Jeff J. McCall, Wendy L. Marlett
and John P. Babel have entered into change in control and severance protection agreements. The agreements have a two year term with a rolling one
year extension.

If the executive’s employment with CalAtlantic is terminated by CalAtlantic without “cause” or by the executive for good reason (generally
consisting of adverse changes in responsibilities, compensation, benefits or location of work place) in connection with a change in control (i.e., “double-
trigger” required for payouts), the executive is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his or her current base salary plus
his or her target bonus for the year of termination, COBRA paid by CalAtlantic for two years, an outplacement benefit, and an additional pro-rata bonus.
The amount of the pro-rata bonus is determined by multiplying his or her target bonus for the year of termination by the quotient obtained by dividing
the number of days in the year up to and including the date of termination by 365. In addition, all unvested equity awards will vest as of the date of
termination.

Retention Arrangements

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, CalAtlantic entered into retention letter agreements with each of Scott D. Stowell, Jeff
J. McCall, Wendy L. Marlett, and John P. Babel (the “Retention Agreements”). The Retention Agreements provide for the payment to each executive of
the following lump sum cash retention bonus on the date the Merger is consummated so long as the executive either remains employed with CalAtlantic
through the consummation of the Merger, or is terminated prior to the consummation of the Merger by CalAtlantic without “cause” at the request of
Lennar: Scott D. Stowell: $8,250,000, Jeff J. McCall: $3,050,000, Wendy L. Marlett: $2,000,000, and John P. Babel: $2,250,000. The bonuses under the
Retention Agreements are in addition to, and not in lieu of, other payments due and payable under CalAtlantic’s employee benefit plans and/or any other
agreement between each executive and CalAtlantic. Payment under the Retention Agreements is contingent upon the completion of the Merger prior to
December 31, 2018, and will be null and void if the Merger is not consummated by that date.

Equity Compensation

At the effective time, the outstanding CalAtlantic options, restricted stock units and SARs held by CalAtlantic’s executive officers that convert
into equity awards with respect to Lennar shares in the manner described above will remain subject to the same service-based vesting conditions;
provided, however, that if an executive officer’s employment is terminated, other than for “cause,” on or prior to the first anniversary of the effective
time, the assumed outstanding equity awards will fully vest upon such termination. Other than such accelerated vesting and the vesting provided for
under the severance and change in control protection agreements described above, there will not be any acceleration or vesting of any equity awards
outstanding under CalAtlantic’s equity incentive plans as a result of the Merger.

Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

In the merger agreement, Lennar and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights of indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and
limitation of liabilities existing in favor of persons who are at the effective time of the Merger are current or former directors, officers and employees of
CalAtlantic and its subsidiaries that are provided in CalAtlantic’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents of any
subsidiary of CalAtlantic or under any indemnification, employment or other similar agreements between any indemnified party and CalAtlantic or any
subsidiary of CalAtlantic, in each case as in effect on the date of the merger agreement will, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the effective
time of the Merger, survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.

In the merger agreement, Lennar and Merger Sub have also agreed to cause the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the company that
survives the Merger to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to

Table of Contents

exculpation, indemnification and advances of expenses of indemnified parties for periods at or prior to the effective time than are set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of CalAtlantic as of the date of the merger agreement.

In the merger agreement, Lennar has guaranteed the indemnification and expense advancement obligations of CalAtlantic and its subsidiaries that
survive the Merger under those provisions of CalAtlantic’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Lennar will, or will cause the company that survives
the Merger to, maintain in effect for not less than six years after the effective time of the Merger, with respect to occurrences at or prior to the effective
time of the Merger, CalAtlantic’s policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that were in effect on the date of the merger agreement
(notwithstanding any provisions of those policies that they will terminate as a result of the Merger), or substantially similar insurance, which in each
case will cover each person covered by CalAtlantic’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, to the extent that insurance is available at an
annual cost not exceeding 200% of the annual cost of the policies of directors and officers liability insurance that were in effect at the date of the merger
agreement. To the extent that insurance is not available at an annual cost that will not exceed that amount, Lennar will, or will cause the company that
survives the Merger to, maintain in effect for that period the maximum amount of insurance coverage that can be obtained for that maximum annual
cost.

Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to CalAtlantic’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger

The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of
information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of CalAtlantic that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger, which is
referred to as the merger-related compensation. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments and benefits described below, see the section
entitled “Interests of CalAtlantic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” above.

The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the
relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions that may
occur before completion of the Merger. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:
 

 
•  the value of the per share merger consideration is $49.13 for each CalAtlantic share based on the average closing price per CalAtlantic share

over the five business days following the first public announcement of the transaction on October 30, 2017.
 

 
•  The effective time is November 1, 2017, which is the assumed date of the closing of the Merger solely for purposes of the disclosure in this

section.
 

 
•  Each executive officer of CalAtlantic was terminated by CalAtlantic without “cause” or resigned for “good reason” (as such terms are

defined in the relevant agreements) in connection with the Merger, in either case immediately following the assumed effective time of
November 1, 2017.

As a result of the foregoing assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the
amounts set forth below.

Mr. Nicholson. The amount set forth for Mr. Nicholson includes the following: (i) $2,089,041 representing a pro rata bonus through the assumed
effective time of November 1, 2017 based on his target annual bonus for 2017, plus (ii) $17,886,778 representing an amount equal to two times
the highest “annual compensation” (as described above) paid to him for any of the three years prior to termination.

Mr. Stowell. The amount set forth for Mr. Stowell includes the following: (i) $9,750,000 representing three times the sum of his current base salary
plus his target bonus for 2017, (ii) $1,880,137 representing a pro-rata bonus, determined by multiplying his target bonus for 2017 by the quotient
obtained by dividing the number of days in the year up to and including the date of termination by 365, and (iii) $8,250,000 pursuant to his
retention agreement described above.

Mr. Skelly. The amount set forth for Mr. Skelly includes the following: (i) $647,603 representing a pro rata bonus through the date of termination
based on his target annual bonus for 2017, plus (ii) $6,846,384 representing an amount equal to two times the highest “annual compensation” (as
described above) paid to him for any of the three years prior to termination.

Mr. McCall. The amount set forth for Mr. McCall includes the following: (i) $3,000,000 representing two times the sum of his current base salary
plus his target bonus for 2017, (ii) $626,712 representing an additional pro-rata, determined by multiplying his target bonus for 2017 by the
quotient obtained by dividing the number of days in the year up to and including the date of termination by 365, and (iii) $3,050,000 pursuant to
his retention agreement described above.

Ms. Marlett. The amount set forth for Ms. Marlett includes the following: (i) $2,100,000 representing two times the sum of her current base salary
plus her target bonus for 2017, (ii) $376,027 representing an additional pro-rata, determined by multiplying her target bonus for 2017 by the
quotient obtained by dividing the number of days in the year up to and including the date of termination by 365, and (iii) $2,000,000 pursuant to
her retention agreement described above.

(2) Equity.

Pursuant to the terms of the severance and change in control protection agreements described above, each named executive officer would be
entitled to accelerated vesting of his or her outstanding equity awards upon a “double trigger” qualifying termination. We have assumed that the
named executive officers will experience a qualifying termination in connection with the Merger. The value of the unvested and accelerated stock
options and stock appreciation rights is the difference between the value of $49.13 per share and the exercise price of the stock option or stock
appreciation right (as applicable), multiplied by the number of unvested shares as of November 1, 2017 and the value of the unvested and
accelerated RSUs is equal to $49.13 multiplied by the number of unvested RSUs as of November 1, 2017 (assuming that RSUs subject to
performance-based vesting criteria vest at the target performance level), in each case, consistent with the methodology applied under SEC
Regulation S-K Item 402(t)(2). The amounts in this column for the unvested and accelerated stock options, stock appreciation rights and RSUs do
not reflect any taxes payable by the named executive officers. For further details regarding the treatment of CalAtlantic equity awards in
connection with the Merger, see the section entitled “Interests of CalAtlantic’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Equity
Compensation.” The value of each such benefit is shown in the following table:

CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

General

The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to a U.S. holder (as defined below) of
CalAtlantic common stock who exchange shares of CalAtlantic common stock for cash, shares of Lennar common stock, or cash and shares of Lennar
common stock in the Merger. For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” refers to a beneficial owner that is:
 

 •  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation, or other entity subject to tax as a corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the

United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 •  an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 

 
•  a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons

or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

Holders of CalAtlantic common stock who are not U.S. holders as defined above may have different tax consequences than those described below
and are urged to consult their own tax advisors about the tax treatment to them under U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws.

This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of CalAtlantic common stock who hold shares of such stock as a capital asset within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences
that may be relevant to U.S. holders of CalAtlantic common stock in light of their particular circumstances or to U.S. holders who may be subject to
special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as tax exempt organizations, S corporations, financial institutions, insurance companies,
broker-dealers, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, U.S. expatriates, persons who hold CalAtlantic shares as part of a hedge,
straddle, wash sale, synthetic security, conversion transaction, or other integrated investment comprised of CalAtlantic shares and one or more
investments, persons whose “functional currency” (as defined in the Code) is not the U.S. dollar, and persons who acquired CalAtlantic shares in
compensatory transactions. Further, this discussion does not address any aspect of state, local, or foreign taxation.

If a partnership (or other entity classified as a partnership or pass-through entity for U.S. federal tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of CalAtlantic
shares, the tax treatment of a partner in that partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.
CalAtlantic stockholders that are partnerships and partners in these partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the Merger to them.

This discussion is based on the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, court decisions, published rulings of the IRS and other
applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and all of which are subject to change or differing
interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect.

THIS SUMMARY IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS OF THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
TO YOU. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE PARTICULAR FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND
FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER AND THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF SHARES OF LENNAR
COMMON STOCK RECEIVED IN THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR OWN SITUATION.

Tax Opinion

Lennar and CalAtlantic intend that the Merger will constitute a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code. In connection
with the filing of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, CalAtlantic’s tax counsel, Gibson Dunn has rendered its
tax opinion to CalAtlantic. It is the opinion of Gibson Dunn that, subject to the qualifications and assumptions described below, the Merger will qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger will be as
described below. In addition, the obligation of CalAtlantic to complete the Merger is conditioned on, among other matters, CalAtlantic’s receipt of an
opinion from Gibson Dunn, dated as of the closing date of the Merger, that for U.S. federal income tax purposes the Merger will be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The conditions relating to receipt of such closing tax opinion may be waived by
CalAtlantic. CalAtlantic does not currently intend to waive the condition related to its receipt of the closing tax opinion.

The opinion of Gibson Dunn, counsel to CalAtlantic, referred to above is based on U.S. federal income tax law in effect as of the date of the
opinion. In rendering the opinion, Gibson Dunn relied on certain assumptions, including assumptions regarding the absence of changes in existing facts
and the completion of the Merger strictly in accordance with the merger agreement and the registration statement of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part. The opinion also relied on certain representations and covenants of the management of Lennar and CalAtlantic, assumed
that the representations are true, correct, and complete and assumed that the covenants will be complied with. If any of the assumptions or
representations are inaccurate, or if any of the covenants are not complied with, the conclusions set forth in the opinion may be invalid. The opinion is
not binding on the IRS or any court. In addition, no ruling from the IRS has been or will be requested regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger. Accordingly, the IRS could disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions set forth in the opinion, and any such
disagreement or challenge could be sustained by a court.

Based on the Gibson Dunn opinion, the following tax consequences will follow from the Merger:

Tax Consequences of the Merger to CalAtlantic Stockholders

The Merger

The Merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code; accordingly, the United States federal income tax
consequences of the Merger to a U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock will depend on whether a holder exchanges its CalAtlantic common stock in
any part for cash.

Exchange Solely for Lennar Common Stock

If, pursuant to the Merger, a U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock exchanges such shares solely for Lennar common shares, such holder will
not recognize any gain or loss on such exchange except in respect of cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Lennar common stock (as discussed
below). The aggregate adjusted tax basis of the Lennar common shares received in the Merger (including fractional shares received and redeemed as
described below) will be equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the shares of CalAtlantic common stock surrendered for the Lennar common
shares, and the holding period of the Lennar common shares (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed as described below) will
include the period during which the CalAtlantic common stock was held.

Exchange for Cash or Exchange for Lennar Common Stock and Cash

If, pursuant to the Merger, a U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock exchanges its CalAtlantic common stock for cash and shares of Lennar
common stock, then such holder generally will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of:
 

 •  any gain realized with respect to such stock; or
 

76



9/24/2019 DEFM14A

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/878560/000119312518003465/d479768ddefm14a.htm 100/239

Table of Contents

 
•  the amount of any cash received with respect to such stock (other than any cash received instead of a fractional share of Lennar common

stock). A holder’s gain realized will equal the difference between the fair market value of the Lennar common stock and cash received and
such holder’s tax basis in the CalAtlantic common stock surrendered.

If, pursuant to the Merger, a U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock exchanges its CalAtlantic common stock solely for cash, then such holder
generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the cash received and such holder’s tax basis in the CalAtlantic
common stock surrendered.

For these purposes, a U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock must calculate gain (or, to the extent relevant, loss) separately for each identifiable
block (that is, stock acquired at the same time for the same price) of CalAtlantic common stock exchanged in the Merger. Except to the extent that any
cash received is treated as a dividend as discussed below, a holder’s recognized gain (or loss) generally will be capital gain (or loss) and will be long-
term capital gain (or loss) if the holder held the exchanged CalAtlantic common stock for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations.

If the receipt of cash in the Merger by a U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock has the effect of a distribution of a dividend, the cash received
will be treated as dividend income to the extent of the stockholder’s ratable share of CalAtlantic’s accumulated earnings and profits (as calculated for
U.S. federal income tax purposes). In general, the determination as to whether the receipt of cash has the effect of a distribution of a dividend depends
upon whether and to what extent the transactions related to the Merger will be deemed to reduce the holder’s percentage ownership of Lennar following
the Merger. For purposes of that determination, a U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock will be treated as if the stockholder first exchanged all of the
stockholder’s CalAtlantic shares solely for Lennar shares, and then a portion of the Lennar shares was immediately redeemed by Lennar for the cash that
the stockholder actually received in the Merger. Gain recognized in the deemed redemption generally will be treated as a dividend to the extent of the
stockholder’s ratable share of the undistributed accumulated earnings and profits of CalAtlantic, unless the deemed redemption results in a “meaningful
reduction” in the stockholder’s deemed stock ownership of Lennar.

In making this determination of whether there is a “meaningful reduction” in the U.S. holder’s deemed ownership of Lennar, the U.S. holder will,
under certain constructive ownership rules contained in the Code, be deemed to own not only the Lennar shares actually owned, but also Lennar shares
that are owned by certain related persons and entities or that the stockholder or such persons or entities have the right to acquire pursuant to an option.
The IRS has ruled that a stockholder in a publicly held corporation whose relative stock interest is minimal and who exercises no control with respect to
corporate affairs generally is considered to have a “meaningful reduction” if that stockholder has any reduction in the stockholder’s percentage stock
ownership under the above analysis. These rules are complex and dependent upon the specific factual circumstances particular to each U.S. holder of
CalAtlantic common stock. Each U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock should consult his, her, or its tax advisor as to the application of these rules
to the stockholder’s particular situation.

A U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock will have an aggregate tax basis in the Lennar shares received in the Merger (including any fractional
shares of Lennar common stock deemed received by the CalAtlantic stockholder) equal to the stockholder’s aggregate adjusted tax basis in the
CalAtlantic shares surrendered in the Merger:
 

 
•  reduced by the amount of cash received in the Merger by the stockholder for those CalAtlantic shares (excluding any cash received in lieu of

a fractional share of Lennar common stock); and
 

 
•  increased by the amount of gain (including the portion of this gain that is treated as a dividend as described above) recognized by the

stockholder in the Merger (excluding any gain recognized as a result of cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Lennar common stock).

The holding period in the Lennar shares received in the Merger by a U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock will include the stockholder’s
holding period in the CalAtlantic shares surrendered in exchange for those Lennar shares, if those CalAtlantic shares are held as capital assets as of the
effective time of the Merger.

Table of Contents

U.S. holders of CalAtlantic common stock who hold CalAtlantic shares with differing bases or holding periods should consult their tax advisors
with regard to identifying the bases or holding periods of the particular Lennar shares received in the Merger.

Certain non-corporate U.S. holders of CalAtlantic common stock whose income exceeds certain thresholds may also be subject to a 3.8 % tax on
their “net investment income” up to the amount of such excess. Gain or loss recognized in the Merger will be includable in the holder’s net investment
income for purposes of this tax. Non-corporate U.S. holders of CalAtlantic common stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible
effect of this tax.

Cash Received in Lieu of Fractional Shares

Cash payments received by a U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock in lieu of fractional shares of Lennar common stock will be treated as if
such Lennar shares were issued in the Merger and then redeemed by Lennar. In that event, subject to the discussion above regarding possible dividend
treatment, the stockholder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the cash received in lieu of those fractional shares
and the portion of the stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in the CalAtlantic common stock surrendered that is allocable to those fractional shares. The
capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for the CalAtlantic share or shares exchanged for cash in lieu of the
fractional share or shares of Lennar common stock is more than one year as of the date of the Merger. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Cash payments received in the Merger by a U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information
reporting and backup withholding on the cash payable to the holder, unless the stockholder provides proof of an applicable exemption or furnishes its
taxpayer identification number (in the case of individuals, their social security numbers), and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the
backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld from payments to a U.S. holder under the backup withholding rules do not represent additional tax and
will be allowed as a refund or credit against the U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to
the IRS.

Reporting Requirements

If a U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock who receives Lennar shares in the Merger is considered a “significant holder,” such stockholder will
be required (i) to file a statement with the stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax return providing certain facts pertinent to the Merger, including the tax
basis in the CalAtlantic shares surrendered and the fair market value of the Lennar shares received in the Merger, and (ii) to retain permanent records of
these facts relating to the Merger. A “significant holder” for this purpose is any U.S. holder of CalAtlantic common stock who, immediately before the
Merger, (i) owns at least 5% (by vote or value) of CalAtlantic common stock or (ii) owns CalAtlantic securities with a tax basis of $1 million or more.

The foregoing discussion is for general information only and is not intended to be legal or tax advice to any particular U.S. holder of CalAtlantic
common stock. Tax matters regarding the Merger are very complicated, and the tax consequences of the Merger to any particular U.S. holder of
CalAtlantic common stock will depend on that stockholder’s particular situation. All holders of CalAtlantic common stock should consult their own tax
advisors to determine the specific tax consequences of the Merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability of U.S. federal, state,
local, and foreign tax laws, and the effect of any proposed change in the tax laws to them.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

This section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the material provisions of the merger agreement, but does not describe all of the
terms of the merger agreement and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The following summary
is qualified by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
incorporated by reference herein. You are urged to read the full text of the merger agreement because it is the legal document that governs the Merger.

The merger agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the merger
agreement. Factual disclosures about Lennar, CalAtlantic or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates contained in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or their respective public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures contained in the
merger agreement and described in this summary. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the merger agreement were made only for
purposes of the merger agreement, as of a specific date. These representations were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement
and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed upon or understood by the contracting parties, including being qualified by
confidential disclosures made for the purpose of allocating risk between parties to the merger agreement rather than the purpose of establishing these
matters as facts, and may apply standards of materiality in ways that are different from those generally applicable to reports filed with the SEC or from
what may be viewed as material by investors. The representations and warranties in the merger agreement do not survive completion of the Merger. For
the foregoing reasons, one should not read the representations and warranties or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts
or condition of CalAtlantic or Lennar.

Terms of the Merger

The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law, (i) at the effective time of the Merger, CalAtlantic will merge with and into Merger Sub, the separate existence of CalAtlantic
will terminate, and Merger Sub will continue as the corporation surviving the Merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar. At the effective time of
the Merger, each share of CalAtlantic common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than shares of
CalAtlantic common stock held in the treasury of CalAtlantic or held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CalAtlantic, and shares of
CalAtlantic common stock held by Lennar or Merger Sub, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger) will be automatically converted into
and become the right to receive either 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A common stock and 0.0177 shares of Lennar Class B common stock by virtue of
the Merger and without any action by the holder, and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Lennar common stock. However, a holder of CalAtlantic
common stock will have the option to elect to receive, with regard to some or all of the holder’s shares, $48.26 per share in cash instead of receiving
Lennar stock. The aggregate amount that Lennar will pay to all CalAtlantic stockholders as a result of cash elections will be limited to $1,162,250,000.
To the extent exercises of the cash election option would require Lennar to pay more than that amount in the Merger, holders who exercise the cash
election option will receive cash for a prorated portion of the shares as to which they exercised the cash option and will receive Lennar Class A and
Class B common stock with respect to the remainder of those shares. Lennar will not issue fractional shares of common stock in the Merger. Instead, all
fractional shares of Lennar common stock that a single holder of CalAtlantic common stock would be entitled to receive shall be aggregated, and any
holder of CalAtlantic common stock who would be entitled to receive a fractional share will receive cash equal to the market value of a share of the
applicable class of Lennar common stock multiplied by that fraction. The market value will be the last sale price reported on the NYSE on the last
NYSE trading day before the effective date of the Merger.

Exchange and Payment Procedures

Promptly after the effective time of the Merger (but in no event later than two business days after the date on which the effective time occurs), if
you are a CalAtlantic stockholder and are the record holder of CalAtlantic common stock at the effective time of the Merger who did not make a cash
election, Lennar’s distribution agent will mail or arrange for the electronic delivery of a letter of transmittal and instructions to you for use in effecting
the surrender of your CalAtlantic common stock (including any stock certificates if you hold shares in certificated form) in exchange for Lennar stock.
When you surrender the certificates for cancellation together with letters of transmittal and any other documents (including in respect of book-entry
shares), you will be entitled to receive the merger consideration, including cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Lennar common stock.

UNLESS YOU ARE EXERCISING THE CASH ELECTION OPTION (DISCUSSED BELOW), PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT YOUR
CALATLANTIC STOCK CERTIFICATES IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE MERGER CONSIDERATION UNTIL YOU RECEIVE THE
TRANSMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS AND LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL FROM THE DISTRIBUTION AGENT.

At the effective time of the Merger, your CalAtlantic shares will automatically be converted into the right to receive Lennar Class A and Class B
common stock. However, the Lennar stock will not be issued to you until the distribution agent designated by Merger Sub receives either (i) the
certificate representing your CalAtlantic shares together with an executed letter of transmittal (in a form that will be mailed to record holders within two
business days after the day on which the Merger becomes effective) and any documents required by it, or (ii) an Agent’s Notice from The Depositary
Trust Company stating that your shares have been transferred by book entry into an account established by the distribution agent for the purpose of
receiving CalAtlantic common stock. If the distribution agent or Lennar determines that the distribution agent is required under any applicable tax law to
withhold merger consideration issuable to any person, the distribution agent will make the required withholding.

If your CalAtlantic shares are represented by a stock certificate registered in your name and that stock certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, you will have to provide an affidavit to that fact and, if required by Lennar, post an indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
in respect of the stock certificate, in order for you to receive your merger consideration from the distribution agent with regard to your lost, stolen or
destroyed stock certificate.

At any time after more than six months following the effective time of the Merger, Lennar may require the distribution agent to return to Lennar
any merger consideration which was provided to the distribution agent but not disbursed to former CalAtlantic stockholders, in which case you must
look to Lennar to receive the merger consideration.

Treatment of Preferred Share Purchase Rights; Convertible Debt

Preferred Share Purchase Rights. At the effective time of the Merger, the preferred share purchase rights issued under the Amended and Restated
Rights Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2011, between CalAtlantic and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as amended, if it still remains in effect, will
be cancelled and will cease to exist, and no additional merger consideration or any other consideration will be issued or paid with regard to these
preferred share rights. Such Amended and Restated Rights Agreement currently expires pursuant to its terms on December 31, 2017, after which time no
preferred share repurchase rights will be outstanding.

Convertible Debt. The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the Merger, all outstanding convertible debt of CalAtlantic which,
by its terms, is convertible into CalAtlantic common stock, will remain outstanding and unaffected by the Merger, except that the holder of such debt
will receive, on conversion of the convertible debt, the number of shares of Lennar Class A common stock equal to (a) the number of shares of
CalAtlantic common stock the holder would have received if the Merger had not taken place multiplied by

(b) 0.885, plus the number of shares of Lennar Class B common stock equal to (x) the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock the holder would
have received if the Merger had not taken place multiplied by (y) 0.0177; unless the indenture relating to a particular issue of convertible debt provides
otherwise, in which case the holder of convertible debt of that issue will receive what is provided in the indenture.

The Supplemental Indenture relating to each of the currently outstanding issues of CalAtlantic convertible notes provides that if Notes are
converted after a merger, holders of the Notes will be entitled to receive upon conversion what they would have received in the merger if they had
converted their Notes immediately before the merger. Each of the Supplemental Indentures goes on to say that in the case of a merger or other
transaction in which holders of common stock can elect more than one type of consideration, what the holders of common stock receive, and therefore
what the holders of Notes will receive on conversion, “will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by
the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such election.” Because the only CalAtlantic stockholders who make an affirmative election will
be CalAtlantic stockholders who elect to receive cash, the Supplemental Indenture provision would result in holders of notes that are converted after the
effective time of the Merger receiving the same consideration per CalAtlantic share that is received by holders of CalAtlantic stock who elect to receive
cash. Unless holders of more than 24,083,091 shares elect to receive cash, holders who elect to receive cash will receive 100% of their merger
consideration in the form of cash of $48.26 per CalAtlantic share. Even if holders of more than 24,083,091 shares elect to receive cash, and therefore the
cash they receive will be prorated, it is likely they will receive a substantial portion of their merger consideration in the form of cash.

Based on the CalAtlantic stock that was outstanding on January 4, 2018, all the CalAtlantic stockholders together will receive a total of
approximately 79.27% Lennar stock (at the rate of 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A common stock and 0.0177 shares of Lennar Class B common stock
per full CalAtlantic share) and 20.73% cash (at $48.26 per full CalAtlantic share). Based on the trading prices of Lennar’s Class A and Class B common
stock on the last NYSE trading day before the date of this joint proxy Statement/prospectus, the value of 79.27% Lennar stock and 20.73% cash will
substantially exceed $48.26 per CalAtlantic share. In order to enable holders of CalAtlantic convertible debt (and, in particular, holders of its 0.25%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2019) to avoid receiving entirely or primarily cash on conversion after the Merger takes place, Lennar intends to offer
holders of CalAtlantic convertible debt for a limited period of time after the Merger takes place the option of electing to receive on conversion the same
combination of Lennar Class A and B common stock and cash that is received in total by the holders of CalAtlantic common stock.

Treatment of Equity Awards

Options. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of CalAtlantic common stock will automatically convert
into an option to acquire the number of shares of Lennar Class A common stock equal to (i) the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock to which
the option related immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (ii) 0.885 (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Lennar
Class A common stock), plus one share of Lennar Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A common stock, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such CalAtlantic option immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. The exercise price of each
outstanding option will be based on the exercise price of the CalAtlantic option per share of CalAtlantic common stock as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger, the exchange ratio of 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A common stock for each share of CalAtlantic common stock and
equitable and proportionate adjustments taking into account the Class B dividend. after the effective time of the Merger, Lennar will file a registration
statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Lennar common stock
subject to such options, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such
options remain outstanding.

Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units. At the effective time of the Merger, each time-based or performance-based RSU award
granted under any of the CalAtlantic equity plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into a right
to receive shares of Lennar

Table of Contents

Class A and Class B common stock, on the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking
into account any acceleration or other deemed satisfaction thereof pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant CalAtlantic equity plans or applicable
award agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby) as are applicable immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. The
number of shares subject to the RSU will be equal to (i) the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock subject to the restricted stock immediately
prior to the effective time of the Merger multiplied by (ii) 0.885 (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Lennar Class A common
stock), plus one share of Lennar Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A common stock. All performance-based vesting criteria to which
any outstanding CalAtlantic RSUs are subject for which the performance period is not completed as of the effective time of the Merger will be deemed
achieved at the target performance level. As soon as practicable after the effective time of the Merger, Lennar will file a registration statement under the
Securities Act on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Lennar common stock subject to such RSUs and
PSUs, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any such RSUs or PSUs
remain outstanding.

Stock Appreciation Rights. At the effective time of the Merger, each SAR based on shares of CalAtlantic common stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time will automatically convert into a right based on the shares of Lennar common stock, on the same terms and
conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration thereof pursuant to the existing
terms of the relevant CalAtlantic equity plans or applicable award agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby) as are applicable
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. Each SAR will convert into (i) the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock to which the
SAR related immediately prior to the effective time multiplied by (ii) 0.885 (rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Lennar Class A
common stock), plus one share of Lennar Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A common stock. The exercise price of each outstanding
SAR will be based on the exercise price of the CalAtlantic option per share of CalAtlantic common stock as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger, the exchange ratio of 0.885 shares of Lennar Class A common stock and equitable and proportionate adjustments taking into account the
Class B dividend. If the holders of SARs are entitled to receive shares of Lennar Class A common stock on exercise of the SARs, as soon as practicable
after the effective time of the Merger, Lennar will file a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Lennar common stock subject to such SARs, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any such SARs remain outstanding.

Adjustments; Dividends

If between October 29, 2017 and the effective time of the Merger, the outstanding shares of CalAtlantic common stock or any or all classes of
Lennar stock are changed into a different number of shares or a different type of securities (by reason of a reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares, conversion or similar event), the exchange ratio will be adjusted so that the Merger will have the same economic effect
on the holders of CalAtlantic common stock as that contemplated by the merger agreement, as if there had been no such event. Except for the previously
declared Lennar Class B common stock dividend described below, if any dividend payable in stock or other securities is declared with regard to the
CalAtlantic common stock or the Lennar stock with a record date between October 29, 2017 and the effective time of the Merger, the exchange ratio will
be adjusted so that the Merger will have the same economic effect on the holders of CalAtlantic common stock as that contemplated by the merger
agreement, as if there had been no such dividend. If Lennar issues shares of its Class B common stock as a dividend with regard to the Lennar stock, that
is payable to holders of record thereof on a date between October 29, 2017 and the effective time of the Merger, the merger consideration will include, in
addition to the Lennar Class A common stock described above in “Terms of the Merger,” the number of shares of Lennar Class B common stock that
would have been issued as a dividend on the Lennar Class A common stock to be paid as merger consideration if it had been outstanding on the record
date for the dividend, and each reference to the exchange ratio in the merger agreement will be deemed to include

Table of Contents

the shares of Lennar Class B common stock that are issuable, except where such deemed substitution would not be practical, such as in adjustments to
the exercise price of CalAtlantic options, in which case there will be another equitable and proportionate adjustment in such exercise price to take into
account the Class B dividend. On October 29, 2017, Lennar declared a stock dividend of one share of Class B common stock for each 50 shares of its
Class A common stock or Class B common stock outstanding, payable on November 27, 2017 to holders of record at the close of business on
November 10, 2017. Because of that, the merger consideration will include one share of Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A common
stock included in the merger consideration (equal to 0.0177 shares of Class B common stock per share of CalAtlantic common stock based on the
exchange ratio of 0.885 shares of Lennar common stock for each share of CalAtlantic common stock).

Cash Election

Each person who is a record holder of CalAtlantic common stock at any time between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the
Election Deadline (defined below), will have the option to elect to receive $48.26 in cash, without interest, per share of CalAtlantic common stock, in
lieu of receiving Lennar common stock in the Merger, subject to possible proration as described below. The option to make a Cash Election will expire
at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the fifth business day before the day on which the CalAtlantic stockholder meeting is scheduled to be held, which we
refer to as the “Election Deadline.” Lennar will cause the distribution agent to transmit a cash election form to each holder of record of CalAtlantic
common stock, which will enable a record holder to specify the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock, if any, as to which the record holder
elects to exercise the cash election option. In order to properly exercise the cash election option, a record holder of CalAtlantic common stock must
timely return a completed and signed cash election form, together with the stock certificate evidencing the shares of CalAtlantic common stock as to
which the cash election option is being exercised or an Agent’s Notice stating that such shares of common stock have been transferred by book entry
transfer to an account established by the distribution agent. A holder of shares of CalAtlantic common stock will have the right to change or withdraw a
cash election at any time before the Election Deadline, but not after the Election Deadline, in accordance with procedures set forth in the instructions to
the cash election form. If the merger agreement is terminated without the Merger taking place, all cash elections will automatically be deemed revoked.

The aggregate amount Lennar will pay as a result of cash elections will be limited to $1,162,250,000. If the total amount of cash consideration
Lennar would be required to pay would exceed $1,162,250,000, each holder of CalAtlantic common stock who makes a valid cash election that is not
withdrawn will receive $48.26 for a prorated number of the shares as to which a cash election is made and will receive Lennar Class A and Class B
common stock for the remaining shares of CalAtlantic common stock. Not more than two business days after the day on which the effective time of the
Merger occurs, Lennar will deliver $1,162,250,000 in cash to the distribution agent.

Any holder of CalAtlantic stock who does not properly exercise the cash election option will receive Lennar common stock in the Merger.

Financing Related to the Merger

Although the Merger is not conditioned upon Lennar having received any financing, in anticipation of the cash payments Lennar may make to
CalAtlantic stockholders in connection with Merger, Lennar sold $1.2 billion of senior notes in a private offering that closed on November 29,
2017. Lennar intends to use the net proceeds from that senior notes offering primarily to fund the cash consideration payable to CalAtlantic stockholders
who elect to receive cash in the Merger, to pay expenses related to the Merger and for general corporate purposes.

Governance Matters

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties before the Merger is completed, Scott D. Stowell will be elected to the Lennar board of directors as of
immediately after the Merger becomes effective. If Mr. Stowell is unable or unwilling to serve as a director of Lennar, the CalAtlantic board of directors
may select another individual to

serve on the Lennar board of directors, such person to be reasonably acceptable to Lennar’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

Lennar did not prior to the time when the merger agreement was signed discuss with any director or officer of CalAtlantic the possibility of that
person’s being employed by CalAtlantic or Lennar after the Merger. Since the merger agreement was signed, Lennar has discussed with some current
officers of CalAtlantic possible roles they might play as employees of CalAtlantic or Lennar after the Merger.

Completion of the Merger

Unless CalAtlantic and Lennar agree otherwise, the closing of the Merger will take place at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the first business day after
the later of the day on which the necessary approvals of CalAtlantic or Lennar stockholders are obtained, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
closing conditions described under “—Conditions to Completion of the Merger” below, and the date on which all closing conditions to completion of the
Merger are satisfied or waived (in each case, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at closing). The Merger will become
effective at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the day on which a certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware or at such other time as
the CalAtlantic and Lennar may specify in the certificate.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger

Each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is conditioned upon the satisfaction (or waiver by such party) at or prior to the closing of the
Merger of each of the following:
 

 
•  approval of the Lennar Merger Proposal by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of Lennar Class A

common stock and Class B common stock that are voted with regard to it, voting together as though they were a single class;
 

 

•  if approval of the Authorized Share Proposal is necessary to enable Lennar to issue all the shares of Class A common stock it will be
required to issue as a result of the Merger (which it probably will not be), approval of the Authorized Share Proposal by the affirmative vote
of both the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Lennar Class A common stock and Class B common stock,
voting together as though they were a single class, and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Lennar Class A
common stock that are voted with regard to the proposal;

 

 

•  (i) the representations and warranties of the other party with respect to organization, authorization, capitalization and absence of undisclosed
brokers’ fees in connection with the transaction must be true and correct in all material respects on the date of closing of the Merger with the
same effect as though made on the closing date, and (ii) all other representations and warranties of the other party (without giving effect to
any “materiality” or “material adverse effect” qualifications in those representations and warranties) must be true and correct in all respects
on the closing date of the Merger, as though made on the closing date, except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
true and correct, in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on such party;

 

 
•  absence of any law, order, judgment, injunction or any other restrict or prohibition by any governmental entity prohibiting consummation of

the Merger or invalidating the merger agreement;
 

 
•  fulfillment, in all material respects, of all obligations of the other party required to be fulfilled by such other party on or before the closing

date;

In addition, CalAtlantic’s obligation to consummate the Merger is conditioned upon the satisfaction (or waiver by CalAtlantic) at or prior to the closing
of the Merger of each of the following additional conditions:

stock it is authorized to issue; and
 

 
•  receipt of a legal opinion of CalAtlantic’s counsel, to the effect that the Merger will constitute a “reorganization” within the meaning of

Section 368(a) of the Code.

Representations and Warranties

Each of Lennar and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and CalAtlantic, on the other hand, has made customary representations and warranties with

such party is a party or by which any of them is bound, any law, or any order, rule or regulation of any court or other governmental agency
or any other regulatory or quasi-regulatory organization having jurisdiction over such party or any of its subsidiaries, except violations,
breaches or defaults that, individually or in aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
upon such a party;

 •  the absence of undisclosed brokers’ fees and expenses.

The merger agreement also contains representations and warranties made only by CalAtlantic regarding, among other things:

of preferred share rights any right to exercise those preferred stock rights or any other rights with regard to the preferred share rights;

Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by a “materiality” or “material adverse effect” standard (that is,
they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct, individually or in the aggregate, would be material or would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect). For purposes of the merger agreement, a “material adverse effect” means, when used with
respect to a party to the merger agreement, a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial

will not constitute, either individually or in combination, a “material adverse effect” or be taken into account when determining whether a “material

merger agreement;

except to the extent that the effect of excluded general changes materially disproportionately adversely affects CalAtlantic or Lennar compared to other
companies engaged in similar businesses, and then only to the extent of such disproportionality.

Conduct of Business Prior to Closing

Each of CalAtlantic and Lennar has undertaken customary covenants in the merger agreement relating to the conduct of its business between the
date of the merger agreement and the completion of the Merger.

In general, each of CalAtlantic and Lennar has agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) operate its
business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) maintain all of its assets in good repair and condition
(except to the extent of reasonable wear and use or of damage by fire or other unavoidable casualty), (iii) maintain its books and records in the usual
manner in accordance with GAAP, except as required by a change in GAAP (or interpretations of it) and (iv) take all commercially reasonable steps to
maintain the goodwill of its businesses and the continued employment of its executives and other employees (other than any loss of employees
attributable to the announcement, pendency or consummation of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by it).

CalAtlantic has agreed that between the date of the merger agreement and the earlier of the effective time of the Merger or the termination of the

agreement, Lennar will not, among other things, without CalAtlantic’s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or

 •  take any action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code;

No Solicitation; Notice of Proposals

Subject to certain exceptions discussed below, CalAtlantic must:
 

 
•  terminate all ongoing discussions with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals or otherwise regarding possible acquisition

transactions; and
 

 

•  not authorize or approve and use its reasonable best efforts to prevent any of its or its subsidiaries’ officers, directors, employees, agents or
other representatives to initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate (by making available non-public information
or otherwise) the making of any alternative acquisition proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to (i) a merger, reorganization,
share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction involving CalAtlantic, (ii) any purchase of or tender or exchange offer for all or any
significant portion of CalAtlantic’s equity securities, or (iii) any purchase of all or, except in the ordinary course of business, a significant
portion of the assets of CalAtlantic and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis;

except that CalAtlantic may interact with a potential acquiror solely to clarify the terms and condition of an acquisition proposal the potential acquiror
has made.

Notwithstanding the above, in connection with any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to a possible acquisition transaction that (i) CalAtlantic
receives despite complying in all material respects with the obligations described above and (ii) which the CalAtlantic board of directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor, constitutes or would be reasonably expected to result in a transaction which would be more
favorable to CalAtlantic’s stockholders than the Merger, CalAtlantic, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives may furnish non-public
information (after receipt of an appropriate confidentiality agreement) to the potential acquiror and enter into discussions and negotiations with the
potential acquiror in response to an alternative acquisition proposal from such potential acquiror.

If at any time, CalAtlantic receives an alternative acquisition proposal, request for non-public information in connection with such a proposal or
an indication that a prospective acquiror intends to make such a proposal, then within two business days, CalAtlantic must inform Lennar, provide the
identity of the third party from which the proposal, request or indication was received, and provide a reasonably detailed description of the material
terms of the proposal, request or indication. Further, CalAtlantic must thereafter promptly provide Lennar with any additional material information
CalAtlantic obtains regarding the proposal, request or notification, and otherwise keep Lennar reasonably informed as to the status of the alternative
acquisition proposal.

Efforts to Obtain Required Stockholder Approvals

Each of CalAtlantic and Lennar has agreed to convene a special meeting of its stockholders as soon as practicable after the registration statement
of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part becomes effective for the purpose of obtaining necessary stockholder approvals, and will use
reasonable best efforts to convene those stockholder meetings within 45 days after that registration statement becomes effective. Either CalAtlantic or
Lennar may, without the consent of the other, adjourn or postpone its respective special stockholder meeting for up to 30 days (or for such longer period
as required by law) for certain reasons, including to solicit additional proxies if CalAtlantic or Lennar, as the case may be, reasonably determines it is
advisable to do so in order to obtain necessary stockholder approvals. Each of CalAtlantic and Lennar is required to use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies or votes giving the necessary stockholder approvals, subject to a permitted change of recommendation of the
CalAtlantic board of directors or the Lennar board of directors, under some circumstances.

Board Recommendations; Fiduciary Out

The CalAtlantic board of directors has unanimously recommended that CalAtlantic’s stockholders adopt the merger agreement and approve the
Merger. The CalAtlantic board of directors may not (i) withdraw that

recommendation or modify it in a manner adverse to Lennar or the Merger or publicly propose to do so, (ii) publicly propose to approve an alternative
acquisition proposal, or (iii) authorize CalAtlantic to enter into a binding agreement with respect to an alternate acquisition proposal before the merger
agreement is terminated, except that the CalAtlantic board of directors may change its recommendation, which we refer to as a “change of
recommendation,” if the CalAtlantic board of directors determines, in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, provided:
 

 

•  CalAtlantic gives Lennar at least five business days’ prior written notice of its intention to change its recommendation if the change of
recommendation is because of an event or circumstance that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the board of directors prior to
execution of the merger agreement, or of which the consequences were not known or reasonably foreseeable, of which the board of directors
becomes aware before its stockholders meeting, which materially increases the value of such company and its subsidiaries, with certain
listed exceptions, which we refer to as an “Intervening Event”;

 

 
•  if the change of recommendation is because of an Intervening Event, and if Lennar asks CalAtlantic to do so, CalAtlantic engages in good

faith discussions with Lennar about possible changes to the terms of the merger agreement that would cause the CalAtlantic board of
directors not to make a change of recommendation;

 

 

•  if the change of recommendation is in order to accept a superior proposal, (i) if Lennar asks it to do so, CalAtlantic engages in good faith
discussions with Lennar during a three NYSE trading day period (or in some instances, a shorter period) about possible changes to the terms
of the merger agreement that would cause the CalAtlantic board of directors to determine that the alternative acquisition proposal described
in the notice to Lennar no longer is a superior proposal and (ii) Lennar fails to give CalAtlantic by the third NYSE trading day after it
receives the notice (or, in some instances, an earlier date) notice that it will amend the terms of the merger agreement, or if such notice is
delivered, the CalAtlantic board of directors in good faith determines after consultation with its financial advisor and consideration of the
changes proposed by Lennar, that the superior proposal continues to be a superior proposal; or

 

 
•  if the alternative acquisition proposal is amended after Lennar has delivered notice that it will amend the terms of the merger agreement,

CalAtlantic is required on up to two additional occasions to provide Lennar with notice of the amended alternative acquisition proposal and
provide Lennar with an opportunity to further amend the terms of the merger agreement.

A “superior proposal” means an alternative acquisition proposal, which (v) is not subject to the outcome of due diligence or any other form of
investigation, (w) is not subject to a financing contingency, (x) is from a potential acquiror which the CalAtlantic board of directors reasonably
determines in good faith after consultation with its independent financial advisor has the financial resources necessary to carry out the transaction, (y) is
not reasonably likely to be the subject of regulatory concerns that could prevent or materially delay completion of the transaction, and (z) the
CalAtlantic board of directors determines in good faith after consultation with its independent financial advisor, and taking account of, among other
things, the value of the synergy benefits resulting from the Merger to be more favorable to the CalAtlantic’s stockholders than the Merger.

The Lennar board of directors has unanimously recommended that Lennar’s stockholders approve the Lennar Merger Proposal and the Lennar
Authorized Shares Proposal. The Lennar board of directors may not withdraw that recommendation or modify it in a manner adverse to CalAtlantic or
the Merger or publicly propose to do so, except that the Lennar board of directors may make a change of recommendation if it determines, in good faith
after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties¸ the Lennar board of directors may
change its recommendation because of an Intervening Event, provided:
 

 •  Lennar gives CalAtlantic at least five business days’ prior notice of its intention to change its recommendation; and

Table of Contents

 
•  if CalAtlantic requests that it do so, Lennar engages in good faith discussions with CalAtlantic about possible changes to the terms of the

merger agreement that would cause the Lennar board of directors not to change its recommendation.

CalAtlantic Cooperation

CalAtlantic is required to, at Lennar’s expense, cooperate in all reasonable respects with the efforts of Lennar to arrange any financing that Lennar
expects to use in connection with the Merger or after the Merger. However, the obligations of Lennar and Merger Sub to carry out the Merger are not
conditioned on any such financing being arranged.

Agreement to Take Further Action and to Use Reasonable Best Efforts

Each of Lennar, Merger Sub and CalAtlantic is required (subject to certain conditions) to use their reasonable best efforts to cause all the
conditions to the Merger to be fulfilled as promptly as practicable and to consummate the Merger.

Employee Benefits Matters

From the effective time of the Merger until November 30, 2018, Lennar will provide to each employee of CalAtlantic or its subsidiaries who
continues to be employed by Lennar or any subsidiary, which we refer to as a “continuing employee,” at Lennar’s election, either (i) compensation
(including, without limitation, base salary or wage rate, bonus or commission opportunity, cash incentive compensation opportunity and, if the
continuing employee received equity compensation from CalAtlantic, equity-based compensation opportunity) that is not less favorable in aggregate to
the continuing employee than the compensation the continuing employee was receiving as an employee of CalAtlantic immediately before the effective
time of the Merger or (ii) the same compensation as that provided by Lennar and its subsidiaries to their similarly-situated employees (taking account of
duties, geographical location and any other relevant factors).

From and after the effective time of the Merger, Lennar will, or will cause Merger Sub to:
 

 

•  credit for all service with CalAtlantic or its subsidiaries as if such service were with Lennar and its subsidiaries for purposes of determining
eligibility, vesting, levels of benefits and benefit accrual under the employee benefit and compensation plans in which the continuing
employee participates after the effective time of the Merger to the same extent that that service was credited under a comparable plan of
CalAtlantic or its subsidiaries;

 

 •  carry over unused vacation days accrued by continuing employees under the plans and policies of CalAtlantic and its subsidiaries;
 

 
•  ensure that no pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods shall apply with respect to the continuing employees under

applicable Lennar benefit plans to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under CalAtlantic benefit plans
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger;

 

 
•  honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each change in control agreement and severance agreement that is in effect as of the date of the

merger agreement between CalAtlantic or any of its subsidiaries and current or former employees or directors of CalAtlantic or any of its
subsidiaries, and (ii) the parameters related to severance set forth in the CalAtlantic disclosure letter;

 

 
•  give to any continuing employees who participated in 401(k), health and welfare plans (which, for avoidance of doubt, include medical,

dental, vision, prescription drug, life insurance, AD&D, disability insurance and flex spending) the opportunity to participate in the most
nearly comparable plans maintained by Lennar through the end of the calendar year in which the effective time of the Merger occurs; and

Table of Contents

 

•  with regard to the annual cash bonuses relating to calendar year 2017: (i) if the effective time of the Merger occurs after February 28, 2018,
CalAtlantic will pay such bonuses no later than February 28, 2018, and (ii) if the effective time of the Merger occurs on or before
February 28, 2018, CalAtlantic will pay such bonuses immediately prior to closing. Such bonuses for each applicable employee shall be paid
consistent with the terms set forth in the CalAtlantic disclosure letter.

Nothing in the merger agreement will confer on any continuing employee any right to continue to be employed by Lennar or any subsidiary,
including the company that survives the Merger, or will be construed to establish a compensation policy or to amend, or to prevent amendments of, any
benefit plan or similar arrangement established, sponsored or maintained by Lennar or any affiliate.

Other Covenants and Agreements

The merger agreement contains additional agreements relating to, among other matters:

Access to Information; Confidentiality

Until the effective time of the Merger or termination of the merger agreement, CalAtlantic will, subject to some limitations, give representatives of
Lennar or of any potential lenders or other sources of financing to Lennar for financing to be used by Lennar in connection with the Merger or after the
Merger, reasonable access during normal business hours to all of its and its subsidiaries properties, books and records and to personnel who are
knowledgeable about the various aspects of the business of CalAtlantic and its subsidiaries. Until the closing, Lennar will, and will cause its
representatives to (in each case with certain exceptions), hold all information they receive as a result of their access to the properties, books, records and
personnel of CalAtlantic in confidence in accordance with the confidentiality agreement previously entered into by CalAtlantic and Lennar. If the
merger agreement is terminated before the effective time of the Merger, Lennar and Merger Sub each will have the same obligations under such
confidentiality agreement with regard to handling and disposition of such confidential information as they had under the agreement before entry into the
merger agreement.

Indemnification and Insurance

Lennar and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights of indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitation of liabilities existing
in favor of the current or former directors, officers, agents and employees of CalAtlantic or its subsidiaries as provided in CalAtlantic’s certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents of any subsidiary of CalAtlantic or under any indemnification or other agreement or
arrangement, in each case as in effect on the date of the merger agreement with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the effective time of the
Merger, will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.

Lennar also will maintain in effect for not less than six years after the effective time of the Merger, with respect to occurrences on or prior to the
effective time of the Merger, CalAtlantic’s policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that were in effect on the date of the merger agreement,
or substantially similar insurance, to the extent that insurance is available at an annual cost not exceeding 200% of the annual cost of the policies of
directors and officers liability insurance that were in effect at the date of the merger agreement. To the extent that insurance is not available at that cost,
Lennar will maintain in effect for that period the maximum amount of insurance coverage that can be obtained for that maximum annual cost.

Certain Tax Matters

The parties to the merger agreement have agreed that they intend that (i) the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) each of Lennar and CalAtlantic will be a “party to a reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations
 

93



9/24/2019 DEFM14A

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/878560/000119312518003465/d479768ddefm14a.htm 117/239

Table of Contents

promulgated under it, and (iii) the merger agreement will constitute a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.368-2(g). Each party will do all things that are commercially reasonable to cause the Merger to qualify for that treatment.

Press Releases

Unless and until the board of directors of either CalAtlantic or Lennar makes an adverse change of recommendation, the two companies will
consult with each other before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the merger agreement, the Merger or
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or making any filings with any third party or any governmental agency with regard to any of
those subjects, provided that any party or any affiliate of a party may (i) make any statement or announcement when and as required by law or by the
rules of any securities exchange or securities quotation or trading system on which securities of that party or an affiliate are listed, quoted or traded, or
(ii) make any press release or public statement without such consultation that is consistent with any press release or public statement to which the parties
previously agreed.

Communications to CalAtlantic Employees

CalAtlantic has agreed to provide Lennar reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the form of any written statements to CalAtlantic
employees and its subsidiaries informing them about the Merger prior to any distribution of such statements.

Defense Against Litigation

If litigation is commenced against CalAtlantic, Lennar, or Merger Sub, seeking to prevent the Merger or obtain damages if the Merger takes place,
whichever of them is a defendant in the litigation will notify the others of them about the commencement of the litigation and keep the others of them
informed about material developments in the litigation or efforts to resolve it, and each of them will cooperate, at its own cost, with the efforts by the
other or others of them to cause the litigation to be dismissed or otherwise resolved on a basis that does not interfere with the ability of the Merger to
take place when and as contemplated in the merger agreement or result in an award of damages against any of CalAtlantic, Lennar or Merger Sub.
CalAtlantic may not settle any such litigation on a basis that requires a payment of money (including payment of fees or other sums to plaintiffs’
counsel) without Lennar’s consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement may be terminated prior to the closing of the Merger, whether before or after approval of the Merger by the CalAtlantic
stockholders, the Lennar stockholders or both (except as otherwise provided below), by the mutual written consent of CalAtlantic and Lennar, or by one
or both of CalAtlantic and Lennar as follows:
 

 
•  by either CalAtlantic or Lennar (provided that such party is not in breach or such party’s breach is not the primary cause of such condition,

as applicable):
 

 

•  if the closing date does not occur on or before May 31, 2018; provided, however, that if closing does not occur on or before such
date because of an order of a court or other governmental authority invalidating the merger agreement or restraining a party from
completing the Merger, either CalAtlantic or Lennar may extend the outside date by three additional months until August 31, 2018
(we refer to such date, including if extended, the “outside date”);

 

 
•  if (i) any law is in effect that would make the Merger unlawful, or (ii) any order of any governmental entity is entered permanently

enjoining CalAtlantic, Lennar or Merger Sub from consummating the Merger and the order has become final and non-appealable;

acquisition proposal no longer is a superior proposal, and CalAtlantic pays Lennar a termination fee;

Effect of Termination

If the merger agreement is validly terminated, then, with certain exceptions, the merger agreement will be null and void and none of the parties
will have any further rights or obligations under it. However, termination of the merger agreement will not relieve a party of liability for any knowing
and intentional breach of its covenants and agreements in the merger agreement that occurs before the merger agreement is terminated.

Termination Fees; Expense Reimbursement

CalAtlantic will be required to pay Lennar a termination fee of $178.7 million if:
 

 •  CalAtlantic terminates the merger agreement to enter into a superior proposal;
 

 

•  CalAtlantic or Lennar terminates the merger agreement because the Merger has not closed by the outside date, and prior to the date
of termination, a company acquisition proposal shall have been submitted by a potential acquiror and not rejected or withdrawn, and
CalAtlantic completes an alternative transaction within 12 months after termination of the merger agreement with such potential
acquiror;

 

 

•  CalAtlantic or Lennar terminates the merger agreement because the CalAtlantic stockholders do not approve the Merger proposal,
and prior to the date of the stockholder meeting, a company acquisition proposal shall have been submitted by a potential acquiror
and not rejected or withdrawn and CalAtlantic completes an alternative transaction within 12 months after termination of the merger
agreement with such potential acquiror;

 

 
•  Lennar terminates the merger agreement after the CalAtlantic board of directors withdraws or modifies its recommendation that

CalAtlantic stockholders vote to approve the Merger;
 

 

•  Lennar terminates the merger agreement because CalAtlantic has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements in the merger agreement in a way that would give rise to failure of designated conditions to closing not being satisfied,
and this breach is either incurable or not cured within 30 business days after CalAtlantic’s receipt of written notice of the breach
from Lennar or one business day prior to the outside date;

 

 
•  Lennar terminates the merger agreement because all the conditions to CalAtlantic’s obligations to effect the Merger have been

satisfied, but CalAtlantic has failed to consummate the Merger by the time the closing should have occurred pursuant to the merger
agreement, which failure is a breach of CalAtlantic’s obligations under the merger agreement; or

 

 

•  Lennar terminates the merger agreement because prior to approval of the Merger proposal by CalAtlantic stockholders, (i) the
CalAtlantic board of directors fails to reaffirm publicly its recommendation of the Merger within ten business days after an
alternative acquisition proposal is first publicly announced, if Lennar requests such a reaffirmation, (ii) any person other than Parent
and its affiliates commences a tender or exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding CalAtlantic common stock, and (A) the
CalAtlantic board of directors or a board committee recommends that the CalAtlantic stockholders tender all or a portion of their
CalAtlantic stock in response to the offer, or (B) CalAtlantic does not within ten business days after the tender or exchange offer is
commenced, file with the SEC a Statement on Schedule 14D-9 which contains a recommendation that CalAtlantic stockholders not
tender their CalAtlantic common stock in response to the offer.

Lennar will be required to pay CalAtlantic a termination fee of $178.7 million if:
 

 

•  the merger agreement is terminated because the Merger does not take place by the outside date and (i) prior to the termination
Lennar had received or communicated a proposal to acquire a homebuilding company that in the preceding year had delivered at
least 14,000 homes that is not rejected or withdrawn and (ii) within 12 months after the merger agreement is terminated, Lennar
acquires that homebuilding company;

Table of Contents

 

•  CalAtlantic terminates the merger agreement because Lennar or Merger Sub has breached any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements in the merger agreement in a way that would give rise to failure of designated conditions to closing, and
this breach is either incurable or not cured within 30 business days after Lennar’s receipt of written notice of such breach or one
business day prior to the outside date; or

 

 

•  CalAtlantic terminates the merger agreement because all the conditions to Lennar’s and Merger Sub’s obligations to effect the
Merger have been satisfied, but Lennar and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the Merger by the time the closing should have
occurred pursuant to the merger agreement, which failure is a breach of Lennar and Merger Sub’s obligations under the merger
agreement.

If the Lennar stockholders do not give the stockholder approval or approvals that are necessary for Lennar to consummate the Merger, and one of
the parties terminates the merger agreement as a result of such failure Lennar will have to reimburse CalAtlantic for its reasonable out-of-pocket Merger
related expenses, up to $30 million. If the CalAtlantic stockholders do not give the stockholder approval that is necessary for CalAtlantic to consummate
the Merger and one of the parties terminates the merger agreement as a result of such failure, CalAtlantic will have to reimburse Lennar for its
reasonable out-of-pocket Merger related expenses, up to $30 million.

Amendment and Waiver

Amendment. The merger agreement may be amended at any time before the Merger becomes effective by an instrument signed by CalAtlantic and
Lennar.

Extension and Waiver. At any time prior to the effective time of the Merger, the parties may to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to it, or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in the merger agreement; but after the CalAtlantic stockholders approve the Merger or the Lennar stockholders approve the Lennar
stockholder proposals, no extension or waiver that, by law, requires further approval by the stockholders of either company, as applicable, may be made
without the approval of such stockholders.

Assignment

Neither the merger agreement nor any right, interest or obligation of any party under it may be assigned (by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties. However, nothing will prevent Lennar from transferring ownership of Merger Sub to a direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar.

Specific Performance

The parties have agreed that in addition to any other remedy to which a party may be entitled, any party will be entitled to obtain an order
compelling specific performance of another party’s obligations under the merger agreement, without any requirement that it post a bond, and if any
proceeding is brought in equity to compel performance of any provision of the merger agreement, no party may raise the defense that there is an
adequate remedy at law.

Governing Law

The merger agreement is governed by, and construed under, the laws of the State of Delaware.

MILLER VOTING AGREEMENT

As inducement to CalAtlantic to enter into the merger agreement, at the same time the merger agreement was signed, Stuart Miller and the Miller
entities entered into a voting agreement with CalAtlantic, which we refer to as the “Miller Voting Agreement.”

Pursuant to the Miller Voting Agreement, Stuart Miller and the Miller entities (i.e., entities owned by trusts for Mr. Miller and members of his
family), which together own Lennar stock that entitles them to cast collectively approximately 39.0% of the votes that can be cast by all the Lennar
stockholders, have agreed to vote all the shares of Lennar stock that they own or have the power to vote in favor of both the proposal to amend Lennar’s
certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of Class A common stock that Lennar is authorized to issue and the proposal to approve the
issuance of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock in connection with the Merger. Mr. Miller and the Miller entities have also agreed to vote those
shares against any transaction that could reasonably be expected to impede the Merger from taking place or materially delay or postpone the time when
it will take place.

If Lennar’s board of directors withdraws its recommendation that Lennar’s stockholders vote in favor of the two proposals, the entity that holds
most of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Miller and the Miller entities will only be required to vote its shares in favor of the two proposals such
that Mr. Miller and the Miller entities together will vote shares representing 30% of the aggregate voting power of the Class B common stock (and
therefore, approximately 19.2% of the total voting power of Lennar’s Class A and Class B common stock voting together) in favor of the two proposals.
That Miller entity will be free to vote the remainder of its shares in its discretion.

Stuart Miller and the Miller entities have also agreed that until the effective time of the Merger, or until the merger agreement is terminated
without the Merger becoming effective, they will not transfer any of their Lennar shares, except that Stuart Miller may sell Class A common stock to
obtain funds with which to pay taxes resulting from vesting of restricted shares of Class A common stock and may make gifts totaling up to 1,000 shares
of Class A common stock.

THE MP CA HOMES VOTING AND CASH ELECTION AGREEMENT

As an inducement to Lennar to enter into the merger agreement, at the same time the merger agreement was signed, MP CA Homes entered into
the MP CA Homes Agreement with Lennar.

Provision Relating to Voting

MP CA Homes, which as of January 4, 2018, owned approximately 24.3% of the outstanding CalAtlantic common stock, agreed to vote all those
shares in favor of adopting the merger agreement and approving any other Merger related matters presented for a vote of the CalAtlantic stockholders,
and in favor of any other matter contemplated by the merger agreement that is presented by CalAtlantic for approval by its stockholders. MP CA Homes
also agreed to vote those shares, and any other shares of CalAtlantic common stock that MP CA Homes owns or has the power to vote, against any
transaction that would prevent or materially delay the Merger, prevent Merger Sub from owning and having the right to use all the real and personal
property, and possessing all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises, owned by CalAtlantic immediately before the Merger, or deprive Lennar from
obtaining the material anticipated benefits of the Merger.

Provision Relating to Cash Election

MP CA Homes is permitted to exercise or not exercise the option to elect to receive cash consideration instead of equity consideration as a result
of the Merger, except that to the extent that the CalAtlantic stockholders do not elect to receive cash consideration with regard to the maximum number
of CalAtlantic shares as to which cash elections can be made, MP CA Homes will be deemed to have made a cash election with regard to the number of
its CalAtlantic shares that would cause cash elections to be made with regard to that maximum number of CalAtlantic shares.

Other Provisions

Until the effective time of the Merger, or until the merger agreement is terminated without the Merger becoming effective, MP CA Homes may
not sell or otherwise transfer any of the CalAtlantic shares it owned when it signed the MP CA Homes Agreement, give anybody else the right to vote
those shares, or do anything else that will prevent MP CA Homes from voting those shares.

Until the cash election option in the merger agreement expires (which will happen on the fifth business day before the scheduled date of the
CalAtlantic stockholders meeting), MP CA Homes will not transfer any of the shares it owned when it signed the MP CA Homes Agreement or do
anything else that will prevent or delay MP CA Homes’ deemed exercise of the option to elect to receive cash instead of Lennar shares, except that MP
CA Homes can transfer shares to any of four affiliated entities if they agree in writing to be bound by all the obligations of MP CA Homes under the MP
CA Homes Agreement.

If as a result of the Merger, MP CA Homes receives 5% or more of the Lennar Class A common stock that will be outstanding immediately after
the Merger, until 90 days after the Merger becomes effective, MP CA Homes has agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer any shares of Lennar Class A
common stock. After that, there will be no restriction under the MP CA Homes Agreement against MP CA Homes’ selling or otherwise transferring
Lennar Class A common stock.

INFORMATION ABOUT LENNAR

Business

The following is a brief description of the business activities conducted by Lennar. More detailed information is contained in Lennar’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2016 and other documents that are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. Both CalAtlantic and Lennar stockholders are urged to refer to those documents for additional information about Lennar. See
“Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 133.

Lennar is one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, a provider of real estate related financial services, a commercial real estate, investment
management and finance company through its Rialto segment and a developer of multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets primarily through
unconsolidated entities.

Lennar’s homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of its business, resulting in $9.74 billion in revenues, or approximately 89% of
consolidated revenues, in fiscal year 2016, and $7.79 billion, or approximately 88%, of consolidated revenues in the first nine months of fiscal year
2017. Lennar currently groups its homebuilding activities into three reportable segments, which it refers to as Homebuilding East, Homebuilding Central
and Homebuilding West, based primarily upon similar economic characteristics, geography and product type. It groups information about its
homebuilding activities in states in which its homebuilding activities are not economically similar to those in other states in the same geographic area
under “Homebuilding Other.” As of August 31, 2017, Lennar’s reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other had operations located in:

East: Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia
Central: Arizona, Colorado and Texas
West: California and Nevada
Other: Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington
Lennar’s other reportable segments are Lennar Financial Services, Rialto and Lennar Multifamily.

Homebuilding Operations

Lennar’s homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase,
development and sale of residential land directly and through unconsolidated entities in which it has investments. It primarily sells single-family
attached and detached homes in communities targeted to first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers. It operates primarily under the Lennar brand
name.

Lennar is involved in all phases of planning and building in its residential communities, including land acquisition, site planning, preparation and
improvement of land and design, construction and marketing of homes. It uses independent subcontractors for most aspects of home construction. At
August 31, 2017, it was actively building and marketing homes in 758 communities, including 5 communities being constructed by unconsolidated joint
ventures.

Lennar generally supervises and controls the development of land and the design and building of its residential communities with a relatively
small labor force. It hires subcontractors for site improvements and virtually all of the work involved in the construction of homes. Lennar generally
does not own heavy construction equipment. It finances construction and land development activities primarily with cash generated from operations and
proceeds of debt issuances.

Lennar sells its homes primarily from models that it has designed and constructed. It employs new home consultants who are paid salaries,
commissions or both to conduct on-site sales of its homes. It also sells homes through independent realtors. Lennar’s marketing strategy is increasingly
focused on advertising through various

digital channels including paid search, display advertising, social media and e-mail marketing, all of which drive traffic to Lennar’s website,
www.lennar.com. However, Lennar also continues to advertise through more traditional media, including newspapers, radio advertisements and other
local and regional publications and on billboards where appropriate. Information included on Lennar’s website is not incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Financial Services Operations

Lennar offers conventional, Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured and Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed residential mortgage loan
products and other products to buyers of Lennar’s homes and others through its financial services subsidiary, Eagle Home Mortgage, LLC, from
locations in most of the states in which Lennar has homebuilding operations, as well as some other states. It also operates a real estate brokerage
business in Florida. During the nine months ended August 31, 2017, Lennar’s financial services subsidiaries provided loans to 80% of its homebuyers
who obtained mortgage financing in areas where it offered financing. Because of the availability of mortgage loans from its financial services
subsidiaries, as well as from independent mortgage lenders, Lennar believes almost all creditworthy purchasers of its homes have access to financing.

Lennar also provides title insurance and closing services to its homebuyers and others. During the nine months ended August 31, 2017, it provided
title and closing services for approximately 81,500 real estate transactions, and issued approximately 239,400 title insurance policies through its
underwriter, North American Title Insurance Company. Title and closing services are provided in 35 states and title insurance services are provided in
40 states.

Rialto Operations

Operations of the Rialto segment include raising, investing and managing third-party capital, originating and securitizing commercial mortgage
loans, as well as investing its own capital in real estate related mortgage loans, properties and related securities. Rialto utilizes its vertically-integrated
investment and operating platform to underwrite, diligence, acquire, manage, workout and add value to diverse portfolios of real estate loans, properties
and real estate related securities as well as providing strategic real estate capital. A Rialto subsidiary, Rialto Mortgage Finance, originates and sells into
securitizations five, seven and ten year commercial first mortgage loans, which are secured by income producing properties. Rialto’s operating earnings
consist of revenues generated primarily from gains from securitization transactions and interest income from the Rialto Mortgage Finance business,
interest income associated with portfolios of real estate loans acquired and other portfolios of real estate loans and assets acquired, asset management,
due diligence and underwriting fees derived from the real estate investment funds managed by the Rialto segment, fees for sub-advisory services, and
Rialto’s net equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities, less the costs incurred by the segment for managing portfolios, costs related to RMF
and other general and administrative expenses.

Lennar Multifamily Operations

Lennar is engaged, primarily through unconsolidated joint ventures, in the development, construction and property management of multifamily
rental properties. The Lennar Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily
rental properties in select U.S. markets. Currently, it primarily uses third-party management companies to rent the apartments, although it anticipates
renting apartments through its own entities in the future. Revenues of the Lennar Multifamily segment are generated by sales of land, construction
activities, management fees from joint ventures and equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities, less the cost of sales of land, expenses related
to construction activities and general and administrative expenses.

INFORMATION ABOUT MERGER SUB

Merger Sub

Cheetah Cub Group Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar, is a Delaware corporation formed on October 25, 2017, for the purpose of being
a party to the merger agreement. In the Merger, CalAtlantic will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity
and continuing to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar.

Merger Sub has not conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters contemplated by the merger agreement,
including the preparation of any applicable regulatory filings in connection with the Merger.

LITIGATION

Since the Registration Statement of which this joint proxy Statement/prospectus is a part was filed with the SEC, two lawsuits have been brought
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against CalAtlantic and all its directors claiming that the Proxy Statement omits
material information with respect to the Merger. One was filed on December 7, 2017, by The Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust, Case No. 1:17-CV-01395.
The other was filed on December 11, 2017, by Jeweltex Manufacturing Inc. Retirement Plan, Case No. 1:17-CV-01416. Each of the suits claims to be
brought as a class action on behalf of the plaintiff and all others similarly situated. The Gusinsky suit claims that the Proxy Statement omitted material
information regarding CalAtlantic’s financial projections and financial analyses performed by J.P. Morgan, potential conflicts of interest of J.P. Morgan
and potential conflicts of interest of CalAtlantic’s officers and directors. The Jeweltex suit alleges that the description of J.P. Morgan’s fairness opinion
and analyses fails to include key inputs and assumptions underlying these analyses, and that the Proxy Statement fails to disclose material information
concerning potential conflicts of interest faced by CalAtlantic insiders and J.P. Morgan. Each suit seeks an injunction against consummating the Merger,
or if the Merger is consummated, rescission of the Merger or award of rescissory damages, and the award to the plaintiff of the costs of the action,
including reasonable allowance for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ and experts’ fees. Lennar is not named as a defendant in either suit. Both CalAtlantic and
Lennar believe the suits are without merit and CalAtlantic intends to defend vigorously against them. It is possible that there will be additional suits
regarding the Merger.

Quorum

The presence, either in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority in voting interest of shares of CalAtlantic common
stock entitled to vote at the CalAtlantic special meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the CalAtlantic special
meeting. The holders of record of a majority in voting interest of shares of CalAtlantic common stock entitled to vote and present in person or
represented by proxy at any meeting of CalAtlantic stockholders, or any officer entitled to preside at, or to act as secretary of, such meeting, whether or
not a quorum is present, may adjourn such meeting to another time and place (subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement). At any such
adjourned meeting at which a quorum will be present, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting. No notice
of an adjourned meeting need be given, if the time and place, if any, of the adjourned meeting and the means of remote communication, if any, by which
stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken, unless the adjournment is for more than 30 days or, if after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting,
in which case a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock represented at the special meeting for
purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved. However, failures to vote and broker non-votes will not be included in the calculation of
the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.

Required Vote

The CalAtlantic Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of CalAtlantic common stock
entitled to vote on the proposal.

The CalAtlantic Merger-Related Compensation Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting interest of the CalAtlantic
stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the CalAtlantic special meeting at which a quorum is present and entitled to vote on the
proposal.

The CalAtlantic Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting interest of CalAtlantic stockholders present
in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal.    

Failure to Vote, Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions

Under the rules of the NYSE, banks, brokers, trusts or other nominees holding shares of record may vote those shares in their discretion on certain
routine proposals when they do not receive timely voting instructions from the beneficial holders. A “broker non-vote” occurs under these NYSE rules
when a bank, broker, trust or other nominee holding shares of record is not permitted to vote on a non-routine matter without instructions from the
beneficial owner of the shares and no instruction is given.

In accordance with these NYSE rules, banks, brokers and other nominees who hold shares of CalAtlantic common stock in “street name” for their
customers but do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares, may not exercise their voting discretion with respect to the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. Accordingly, if banks, brokers or other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares,
they may not vote such shares with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Your failure to vote, or failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote, and abstentions are treated as follows:
 

 
•  With respect to the CalAtlantic Merger Proposal, failure to vote, broker non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as votes against

the proposal.

your shares are registered in your name with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., CalAtlantic’s transfer agent and registrar, you may vote in person at
the special meeting or represented by proxy. If your shares are held in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record in an account with a
broker, bank or other nominee, you must follow the instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to vote.

Voting in Person

If you plan to attend the CalAtlantic special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Please note,
however, that if your shares are held in “street name,” and you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must bring to the special meeting a proxy
executed in your favor from the record holder (your broker, bank or other nominee) of the shares authorizing you to vote at the special meeting.

In addition, if you are a registered stockholder, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver’s license. If you hold your
shares in “street name,” you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or letter from your bank, broker or other
nominee, along with proper identification.

Voting by Proxy

If you are a holder of record, a proxy card is enclosed for your use. CalAtlantic requests that you submit a proxy via Internet by logging onto
http://www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions on your proxy card or by telephone by dialing 1-800-690-6903 and listening for further
directions or by signing the accompanying proxy and returning it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. You should vote your proxy in
advance of the meeting even if you plan to attend the CalAtlantic special meeting. You can always change your vote at the CalAtlantic special meeting.
Stockholders of CalAtlantic of record may submit their proxies through the mail by completing their proxy card, and signing, dating and returning it in
the enclosed, pre addressed, postage-paid envelope. To be valid, a returned proxy card must be signed, dated and received before the CalAtlantic special
meeting. If you hold your shares of CalAtlantic capital stock in street name, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee that
you must follow in order to vote your shares. If you vote by Internet or telephone, you need not return a proxy card by mail, but your vote must be
received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on February 11, 2018.

How Proxies are Counted

All shares represented by validly executed proxies received in time for the CalAtlantic special meeting will be voted at the meeting in the manner
specified by the stockholders giving those proxies. Validly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted “FOR” the proposals.

For purposes of determining the outcome of any matter as to which a broker or nominee has physically indicated on the proxy or indicated
electronically that it does not have discretionary authority to vote, those shares will be treated as not present and not entitled to vote with respect to that
matter. Broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as votes against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Broker non-votes, if any, will
have no effect on the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, specific compensatory arrangements between CalAtlantic and its named
executive officers relating to the proposed Merger.

Revocation of Proxies

Any stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time prior to its use by writing to the Secretary of CalAtlantic, by voting again via mail,
telephone or the Internet, or by attending the CalAtlantic special meeting and casting his or her vote in person. A stockholder’s last timely vote will be
the vote that is counted.

Please note that if your shares are held in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may change your vote by submitting new
voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee in accordance with its established procedures. If your shares are held in the name of a broker,
bank or other nominee and you decide to change your vote by attending the special meeting and voting in person, your vote in person at the special
meeting will not be effective unless you have obtained and present an executed proxy issued in your name from the record holder (your broker, bank or
other nominee).

Tabulation of Votes

CalAtlantic has appointed Broadridge to serve as the Inspector of Election for the CalAtlantic special meeting. Broadridge will independently
tabulate affirmative and negative votes and abstentions.

Solicitation of Proxies

CalAtlantic is soliciting proxies for its special meeting and, in accordance with the merger agreement, the cost of proxy solicitation will be borne
by CalAtlantic. CalAtlantic may reimburse brokers or persons holding stock in their names or in the names of their nominees for their expenses in
sending proxy materials to beneficial owners who request paper copies. Certain officers, directors and regular employees of CalAtlantic, who will
receive no extra compensation for their services, may solicit proxies by mail, telephone, facsimile, e-mail or personally.

CalAtlantic has retained the services of Georgeson LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of $10,000, plus reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses. CalAtlantic will make arrangements with brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy
solicitation materials to beneficial owners of shares held of record by them.

Adjournments

Any adjournment of the CalAtlantic special meeting may be made from time to time by approval of the holders of a majority in voting interest of
the CalAtlantic stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the CalAtlantic special meeting, whether or not a quorum exists, and entitled to
vote thereat, without further notice other than by an announcement made at the adjourned CalAtlantic special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the
CalAtlantic special meeting, or if a quorum is present at the adjourned CalAtlantic special meeting but there are not sufficient votes at the time of the
CalAtlantic special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, then CalAtlantic stockholders may be asked to vote on a proposal to
adjourn the special meeting so as to permit the further solicitation of proxies.

LENNAR SPECIAL MEETING

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to the stockholders of Lennar as part of a solicitation of proxies by the Lennar board of
directors for use at the Lennar special meeting to be held at the time and place specified below, and at any validly convened meeting following an
adjournment or postponement thereof. This joint proxy statement/prospectus provides stockholders of Lennar with the information they need to know to
be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the Lennar special meeting.

Date, Time and Place

The Lennar stockholders meeting will be held on February 12, 2018, at 11:00 a.m., Eastern time, at Lennar’s offices, 700 Northwest 107th
Avenue, Miami, Florida 33172.

Purpose of the Meeting

At the stockholders meeting, Lennar stockholders will be asked to vote on three proposals:
 

 
•  Lennar Merger Proposal: To approve the issuance of shares of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock in connection with the Merger as

contemplated by the merger agreement;
 

 
•  Lennar Authorized Share Proposal: To approve an amendment to Lennar’s certificate of incorporation increasing the number of shares of

Class A common stock that Lennar is authorized to issue to 400,000,000 shares.
 

 
•  Lennar Adjournment Proposal: To approve an adjournment of the Lennar special meeting, if necessary, in order to enable Lennar to solicit

additional votes if at the time of the stockholders meeting there are not sufficient votes to approve the Lennar Merger Proposal and the
Lennar Authorized Share Proposal.

Quorum

The presence in person or by proxy of holders of a majority in voting power, and not less than one-third in number, of the shares entitled to vote at
the Lennar stockholders meeting will be necessary, and will constitute a quorum, for the transaction of business at that meeting. Shares that are present
but abstain from voting will be treated as present for the purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, even though they will not be voted (except
that they will be treated as negative votes with regard to the Lennar Merger Proposal). Any shares that are not able to be voted, such as shares held by
brokers or other fiduciaries who do not receive necessary voting instructions from beneficial owners (so-called broker non-votes) will not be counted as
present for purposes of the quorum determination. After a quorum has been established at any stockholders’ meeting, the subsequent withdrawal of
stockholders, so as to reduce the number of shares entitled to vote at the meeting below the number required for a quorum, shall not affect the validity of
any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.

Required Vote

The Lennar Merger Proposal.

The Lennar Merger Proposal will be approved if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the shares of Class A common
stock and the shares of Class B common stock that are voted with regard to the proposal at the Lennar special meeting at which a quorum is present
(treating abstentions as votes against), voting together as though they were a single class.

Stuart Miller, Lennar’s Chief Executive Officer and director, and the entities owned by family trusts, which together have the right to cast 39.0%
of the total number of votes that can be cast by the holders of the Class A

Table of Contents

and Class B common stock voting as a single class (but only 0.73% of the votes that can be cast by holders of the Class A common stock voting
separately), have agreed that unless the Lennar board of directors changes its recommendation, they will vote all the Lennar shares they own or
otherwise have the power to vote in favor of the Lennar Merger Proposal and the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal. If the Lennar board of directors
ceases to recommend that Lennar’s stockholders vote in favor of the Lennar Merger Proposal and the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal (if it is
necessary to carry out the Merger), Mr. Miller and the Miller entities will only be required to vote shares representing 30% of the outstanding Class B
common stock (which would equal 19.2% of the combined voting power of the Class A and Class B common stock voting together) in favor of the
Lennar Merger Proposal and the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal.

The Lennar Authorized Share Proposal.

The Lennar Authorized Share Proposal will be approved if it receives the affirmative vote of both:
 

 
•  holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and the shares of Class B common stock, voting

together as though they were a single class; and
 

 
•  holders of a majority of the shares of Class A common stock that are voted with regard to the proposal at the Lennar special meeting at

which a quorum is present.

The holders of the Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters, including the separate vote of the holders of the Class A
common stock regarding the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal. The holders of the Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share with regard
to all matters as to which they are entitled to vote. At January 4, 2018, there were 203,952,285 shares of Class A common stock and 36,007,774 shares
of Class B common stock outstanding. The holders of the Class B common stock, as well as the holders of the Class A common stock, will be entitled to
vote on all matters that come before the Lennar stockholders meeting, other than the separate vote of the holders of the Class A common stock regarding
the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal.

Failure to vote with regard to the Lennar Merger Proposal and the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal with respect to the combined vote
of the Class A and Class B common stock has the same effect as a vote against that proposal. Further, under certain circumstances, approval of
the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal may be a condition to CalAtlantic’s (or Lennar’s) obligation to carry out the Merger. Therefore, failing
to vote in favor of the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal may have the same effect as voting against the Merger. You are urged to vote with
regard to all proposals.

Recommendation of Lennar Board of Directors

The Lennar board of directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote all of their shares of Class A common stock and Class B common
stock “FOR” the Lennar Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal, and “FOR” the Lennar Adjournment Proposal. If there is
any change in that recommendation before the stockholders meeting, the holders of Lennar stock of both classes will be notified of the change.

Who Can Vote

Holders of record of Lennar Class A common stock or Lennar Class B common stock at the close of business on January 4, 2018 will be entitled
to vote at the Lennar stockholders meeting or any adjournments of it (unless the Lennar board of directors selects a later record date for an adjourned
meeting). Nobody other than holders of record of Lennar stock at that time will be entitled to vote at the Lennar stockholders meeting.

Voting of Proxies

A proxy given by a record holder authorizes the persons named on the proxy card to vote the holder’s shares at the Lennar stockholders meeting as
instructed. A Lennar stockholder may vote by proxy or in person at the

Table of Contents

Lennar stockholders meeting. If your shares of Lennar common stock are registered in your name (rather than in the name of a broker or other fiduciary)
you may submit a proxy:
 

 •  By Telephone, by dialing the toll-free number specified on the proxy card and following the instructions on the proxy card;
 

 •  Via the Internet, by accessing the website specified on the proxy card and following the instructions on the proxy card; or
 

 
•  By Mail, by completing the proxy card and returning it in the enclosed envelope. The envelope requires no additional postage if mailed in

the United States.

Lennar requests that all stockholders submit their proxies as soon as possible. If a properly executed proxy is returned, the shares of Lennar stock
represented by it will be voted at the Lennar stockholders meeting in accordance with the instructions on the proxy card.

If any proxy is returned without an indication as to how the shares to which it relates are to be voted with regard to a proposal, the Lennar stock to
which the proxy relates will be voted FOR that proposal. Unless a stockholder checks the box on a proxy card to withhold discretionary authority, the
proxyholders may use their discretion to vote on any matters that come before the Lennar stockholders meeting in addition to the three proposals listed
on the proxy card.

Shares Held in Street Name; Broker Non-Votes

If your Lennar shares are held in an account at a broker or through another nominee, you must instruct the broker or other nominee how to vote
your shares by following the instructions that the broker or other nominee provides with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Most brokers make it
possible for stockholders to submit voting instructions by mail (by completing a voting instruction card provided by the broker), by telephone or via the
Internet.

If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker or other nominee, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which your broker or
other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote. Under current NYSE rules, brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the
proposals that will be voted upon at the Lennar stockholders meeting. Therefore, failure to give an instruction will result in a broker non-vote, which
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal with respect to the combined vote of the Class A and Class B
common stock. If the number of shares of Class A common stock that Lennar is required to issue in the Merger exceeds the number of shares of Class A
common stock that Lennar currently is authorized to issue (which would be the case if no CalAtlantic stockholders exercise the cash election option
under the merger agreement), approval of the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal would be required for completion of the Merger.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a Stockholder’s Vote

You may revoke your proxy or change your vote with regard to a matter at any time before your shares are voted with regard to that matter at the
Lennar stockholders meeting. You may do that by:
 

 
•  sending a written notice, which is received prior to your vote being cast at the Lennar stockholders meeting, to Lennar Corporation, 700

N.W. 107th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33176, Attention: Corporate Secretary, that bears a date later than the date of your most recent prior
proxy and states that you revoke that proxy;

 

 
•  submitting a valid, later-dated proxy by mail, telephone or via the Internet that is received prior to your vote being cast with regard to a

matter at the Lennar stockholders meeting; or
 

 
•  attending the Lennar stockholders meeting and voting by ballot in person with regard to a matter (your attendance at the meeting will not, by

itself, revoke any proxy that you have previously given).

If you hold your Lennar shares through a broker or other nominee, you must follow the directions you receive from the broker or other nominee in
order to revoke your proxy or change your voting instructions.

Solicitation of Proxies

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Lennar board of directors. Lennar is
bearing all costs and expenses in connection with this solicitation of proxies (CalAtlantic is bearing the costs of a meeting of its stockholders at which
they are being asked to vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement and approve the Merger). Lennar has engaged MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to
assist in the solicitation of proxies for the meeting. Lennar will pay MacKenzie Partners, Inc. a fee for these services which it estimates will be
approximately $10,000, plus reimbursement of expenses.

In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by Lennar officers, directors and regular employees, without additional
remuneration, in person, by telephone or by some other means of communication. Lennar will reimburse brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries for the reasonable expenses they incur in forwarding proxy solicitation materials to beneficial owners of Lennar common stock.

Voting by Lennar Directors and Executive Officers

On January 4, 2018, the record date for determining the Lennar stockholders who will be entitled to vote at the Lennar stockholders meeting,
Lennar directors and executive officers and their affiliates owned and were entitled to vote 4,581,782 shares of Class A common stock and 22,085,396
shares of Class B common stock. That gave them the power to cast approximately 40.0% of the votes that may be cast with regard to proposals at the
Lennar stockholders meeting, except that they only have the power to cast approximately 2.2% of the votes that can be cast in the separate vote of the
holders of Class A common stock regarding the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal. It is currently expected that the Lennar directors and executive
officers will vote their shares of Lennar common stock of both classes in favor of each of the proposals to be considered at the Lennar stockholders
meeting. However, except as described above with regard to Stuart Miller and entities owned by trusts for members of his family, none of the directors
or executive officers has entered into any agreements regarding how they will vote.

Attending the Lennar Stockholders Meeting

Subject to space availability, all record owners of Lennar stock as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the Lennar
stockholders meeting. Since seating is limited, admission to the meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration and seating will begin at
9:00 a.m., Eastern time.

If your Lennar stock is registered in your name, please bring a valid picture identification.

If your shares of Lennar stock are registered in the name of a broker or other nominee and you want to attend the Lennar stockholders meeting,
you must bring a proxy from the broker or other nominee, and evidence of your stock ownership, such as your most recent brokerage or other account
statement. You also must bring a valid picture identification.

No Other Business

Lennar is not aware of any matters other than the three proposals described above that are expected to come before the Lennar stockholders
meeting. If any other matters are presented to the meeting, the proxies will vote in their discretion with regard to them.

CALATLANTIC PROPOSALS

Item 1. The CalAtlantic Merger Proposal

As discussed throughout this joint proxy statement/prospectus, CalAtlantic is asking its stockholders to approve the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement and approve the Merger. Holders of shares of CalAtlantic common stock should read carefully this joint proxy statement/prospectus in its
entirety, including the annexes, for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the Merger. In particular, holders of shares of
CalAtlantic common stock are directed to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The affirmative vote of a majority of holders of the outstanding shares of CalAtlantic common stock entitled to vote is required to approve the
CalAtlantic Merger Proposal.

The CalAtlantic board of directors recommends a vote “FOR” the CalAtlantic Merger Proposal.

Item 2. The CalAtlantic Merger-Related Compensation Proposal

In accordance with Section 14(A)(b) of the Exchange Act, CalAtlantic is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding,
advisory vote at the CalAtlantic special meeting to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to CalAtlantic’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger and the agreements and understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or has become payable
in connection with the Merger, as disclosed under “The Merger—Quantification of Potential Payments to CalAtlantic’s Named Executive Officers in
Connection with the Merger” This non-binding advisory proposal relates only to the contractual obligations of CalAtlantic that exist as of the
completion of the Merger (including arrangements that will only become effective if the Merger is consummated) that may result in a payment to
CalAtlantic’s named executive officers in connection with the consummation of the Merger (regardless of the timing of payment) and does not relate to
any new compensation or other arrangements following the Merger.

As required by those rules, CalAtlantic is asking its stockholders to vote on the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis of the specified
compensatory arrangements between CalAtlantic and its named executive officers related to the Merger.

The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the Merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the Merger.
Accordingly, CalAtlantic stockholders may vote to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to CalAtlantic’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger and vote to not approve the Merger and vice versa. The affirmative vote of holders of a majority in voting interest
of the CalAtlantic stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the CalAtlantic special meeting at which a quorum is present and entitled to
vote on such proposal is required to approve such compensation arrangements, but because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on
CalAtlantic or the Surviving Corporation. Accordingly, if the Merger is consummated, CalAtlantic will be contractually obligated to pay the
compensation payable under such arrangements, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

The Merger is not conditioned on the approval of this proposal.

The CalAtlantic board of directors recommends a vote “FOR” the CalAtlantic Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.

Item 3. The CalAtlantic Adjournment Proposal

The CalAtlantic special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if CalAtlantic determines it is necessary or appropriate, to permit,
among other things, further solicitation of proxies if necessary to obtain additional votes in favor of the CalAtlantic Merger Proposal.

Table of Contents

If, at the CalAtlantic special meeting, the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock present or represented and voting in favor of any of the
proposals is insufficient to approve such proposal, CalAtlantic intends to move to adjourn the CalAtlantic special meeting in order to enable the
CalAtlantic board of directors to solicit additional proxies for approval of the CalAtlantic Merger Proposal.

In the CalAtlantic Adjournment Proposal, CalAtlantic is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the CalAtlantic
board of directors to vote in favor of granting discretionary authority to the proxy holders, and each of them individually, to adjourn the CalAtlantic
special meeting to another time and place, including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the CalAtlantic stockholders approve the proposal
to adjourn the special meeting, CalAtlantic could adjourn the CalAtlantic special meeting and any adjourned session of the CalAtlantic special meeting
and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from CalAtlantic stockholders who have previously voted.

The holders of a majority in voting interests of the CalAtlantic stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting of
CalAtlantic stockholders may adjourn such meeting to another time and place (subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement).

The CalAtlantic board of directors recommends a vote “FOR” the CalAtlantic Adjournment Proposal.

Table of Contents

LENNAR PROPOSALS

Item 1. The Lennar Merger Proposal

As discussed above in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Lennar has entered into the merger agreement and agreed to the Merger. This joint
proxy statement/prospectus contains extensive information about the Merger, including a description of the reasons Lennar’s board approved Lennar’s
entering into the merger agreement. Because the Merger will be between CalAtlantic and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar, and after the Merger
Lennar’s stockholders will continue to own the same Lennar shares they own immediately before the Merger, Delaware law does not require that
Lennar’s stockholders approve its entering into the merger agreement. However, because in the Merger Lennar will issue more than 20% of the number
of shares of its Class A and Class B common stock that are outstanding immediately before the Merger, the rules of the NYSE require that Lennar’s
stockholders approve the issuance of Class A common stock in the Merger. The Lennar Merger Proposal seeks that approval.

The shares that Lennar will issue as merger consideration with regard to a share of CalAtlantic common stock will consist of 0.885 shares of
Lennar Class A common stock and 0.0177 shares of Lennar Class B common stock. The Class B common stock is to take into account a stock dividend
of one share of Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A or Class B common stock that was distributed on November 27, 2017 to holders of
record of Lennar stock on November 10, 2017. The Lennar Merger Proposal seeks approval of the issuance of both Class A and Class B common stock
as a result of the Merger.

The Lennar board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the Lennar Merger Proposal.

Item 2. The Lennar Authorized Share Proposal

Lennar’s certificate of incorporation authorizes it to issue 490,500,000 shares of common stock, of which 300,000,000 million shares are
classified as Class A common stock, par value $.10 per share, 90,000,000 shares are classified as Class B common stock, par value $.10 per share,
100,000,000 shares are classified as participating preferred stock, par value $.10 per share, and 500,000 shares are classified as preferred stock, par
value $10.00 per share. At October 31, 2017, there were 203,956,720 shares of Lennar Class A common stock outstanding, and there were options that
would entitle the holders to purchase an additional 20,575 shares of Class A common stock. Therefore, Lennar had only 96,022,705 shares of Class A
common stock that it was authorized to issue that were not outstanding or subject to options. At that date, there were also 31,303,195 shares of Class B
common stock outstanding, and there was no participating preferred stock or preferred stock outstanding. On October 29, 2017, the Lennar board of
directors declared a stock dividend of one share of Class B common stock for each 50 shares of Class A or Class B common stock, payable on
November 27, 2017 to holders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2017. Lennar will distribute approximately 4,705,205 shares of
Class B common stock as a result of that dividend, which would increase the outstanding Class B common stock to 36,008,400 shares.

At the time the merger agreement was signed, CalAtlantic had approximately 110,400,000 shares outstanding and had outstanding convertible
debt securities, options and other securities that could require it to issue up to 12.9 million additional shares of its common stock. Therefore, it was
possible that Lennar would have to issue as many as 109.1 million shares of Class A common stock as a result of the Merger. Lennar could not do that
without an increase in the number of shares of Class A common stock it is authorized to issue. Therefore, the merger agreement contemplates that
Lennar will ask its stockholders to authorize and approve an amendment to Lennar’s certificate of incorporation increasing the number of shares of
Class A common stock that Lennar is authorized to issue under its certificate of incorporation to a number at least sufficient to enable Lennar to issue all
the shares of Class A common stock that will constitute merger consideration or are otherwise required under the merger agreement. Approval of that
amendment by the Lennar stockholders, if required, is a condition to the obligations of each of Lennar and CalAtlantic to carry out the Merger.

Table of Contents

The merger agreement gives CalAtlantic stockholders the right to elect to receive cash consideration, instead of Lennar Class A and Class B
common stock, with regard to up to 24,083,091 shares of CalAtlantic common stock. As described under “The MP CA Homes Voting Agreement and
Cash Election Agreement,” MP CA Homes has agreed that to the extent the number of shares that are the subject of elections to take cash consideration
is less than that maximum number, MP CA Homes LLC will be deemed to have elected to receive the cash consideration with respect to a number of
shares such that elections to take cash consideration will be made with regard to all 24,083,091 shares. That will reduce the number of shares of Class A
common stock Lennar will issue in the Merger to approximately 81.5 million shares plus however many shares it is required to issue in or after the
Merger with regard to conversions of debt securities or exercises of options or similar rights.

Therefore, it is very likely that Lennar could complete the Merger without being required to issue more than the number of unissued shares of
Class A common stock it currently is authorized to issue. However, even if that is the case, it would leave Lennar with virtually no shares of Class A
common stock that it could issue as part of its normal employee incentive programs or for any other purposes. Therefore, Lennar’s board of directors
recommends that, even if it is not necessary to enable Lennar to complete the Merger, the stockholders of Lennar approve an amendment to Lennar’s
certificate of incorporation increasing the number of shares of stock it is authorized to issue to 590,500,000 shares, of which 400,000,000 shares are
classified as Class A common stock, 90,000,000 shares are classified as Class B common stock, 100,000,000 shares are classified as participating
preferred stock and 500,000 shares are classified as preferred stock. The complete text of the amendment to Lennar’s certificate of incorporation is
attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B.

Under Delaware law and Lennar’s certificate of incorporation, the amendment to Lennar’s certificate of incorporation must be approved by the
holders of a majority in voting power of Lennar’s outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote on it voting together
without regard to class. In addition, under Lennar’s certificate of incorporation, an amendment changing the number of authorized shares of Class A
common stock must be approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of Class A common stock (and participating preferred stock, if any were
outstanding) which are voted with regard to the amendment.

The Lennar board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal.

Item 3. The Lennar Adjournment Proposal

If the number of shares of Lennar common stock present or represented by proxy at the Lennar stockholders meeting and voting in favor of the
Lennar Merger Proposal or the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal is not sufficient to approve that proposal, Lennar expects that the chairman of the
meeting will propose to adjourn the Lennar stockholders meeting in order to enable Lennar’s board of directors and management to solicit additional
proxies for approval of the proposals. In that event, at the stockholders meeting, Lennar will ask its stockholders to vote only upon the Lennar
Adjournment Proposal, and not upon any other proposal. It will ask stockholders to vote on the other proposals at the adjourned stockholders meeting.

In the Lennar Adjournment Proposal, Lennar is asking its stockholders to grant the holder of any proxy solicited by Lennar or its board of
directors discretionary authority to vote in favor of a proposal to adjourn the Lennar stockholders meeting to another time and place for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies, if such a proposal is made.

The Lennar board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the Lennar Adjournment Proposal.

Obligation to Reimburse CalAtlantic Expenses

If Lennar’s stockholders do not approve the Lennar Merger Proposal, and possibly if Lennar’s stockholders do not approve the Lennar Authorized
Share Proposal (depending on whether the Class A common stock Lennar is authorized to issue without amending its certificate of incorporation is
sufficient to enable Lennar to issue all

required to reimburse CalAtlantic for all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred or paid by CalAtlantic in connection with the negotiation
of the merger agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including all due diligence and
financing costs, filing fees, printing fees and fees and expenses of law firms, commercial banks, investment banking firms, accountants, experts and
consultants, not to exceed $30 million.

DESCRIPTION OF LENNAR CAPITAL STOCK

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the material terms of Lennar’s capital stock, including the Class A common stock
and Class B common stock that will be part of the merger consideration.

General

At the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Lennar is authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, $0.10 par
value, 90,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, $0.10 par value, 100,000,000 shares of participating preferred stock, $0.10 par value, and 500,000
shares of preferred stock, $10.00 par value. On October 31, 2017, 203,956,720 shares of its Class A common stock, 31,303,195 shares of its Class B
common stock and no shares of participating preferred stock or preferred stock were outstanding. Lennar’s Class A common stock is listed on the NYSE
under the symbol “LEN” and its Class B common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “LEN.B.”

Description of Common Stock

Dividend Rights

Subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock or participating preferred stock that Lennar may issue in the future, the
Lennar Class A stockholders and Lennar Class B stockholders are entitled to share equally, on a per share basis, in any dividends that the Lennar board
may declare from time to time. If a dividend is paid in the form of shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock, the Lennar board may
determine that the Lennar Class A stockholders will receive Class A common stock, and the Lennar Class B stockholders will receive Class B common
stock.

Voting Rights

Lennar’s Class B common stock is identical in every respect with its Class A common stock, except that (a) each share of Class B common stock
entitles the holder to ten votes on each matter submitted to the vote of the common stockholders, while each share of Class A common stock entitles the
holder to only one vote, (b) amendments to provisions of Lennar’s certificate of incorporation relating to the Class A common stock, Class B common
stock or the participating preferred stock require the approval of a majority of the shares of participating preferred stock and Class A common stock,
voting together, which are voted with regard to the amendments (as well as approval of a majority in voting power of all the outstanding Class A
common stock, Class B common stock and participating preferred stock voting together) and (c) under the DGCL, certain matters affecting the rights of
Lennar Class B stockholders may require approval of the Lennar Class B stockholders voting as a separate class. The Lennar stockholders do not have
cumulative voting rights.

As of January 4, 2018, Stuart Miller, Lennar’s Chief Executive Officer, had voting control, through his interests in the Miller entities and personal
holdings, of Class A and Class B common stock which would entitle Mr. Miller to 39.0% of the combined votes that could be cast by the Lennar Class A
stockholders and Lennar Class B stockholders combined (which will be reduced to 33.0% by the anticipated issuance of shares in connection with the
Merger, assuming CalAtlantic stockholders elect to receive cash consideration in the Merger with respect to the maximum possible number of shares of
CalAtlantic common stock). That gives significant influence to Mr. Miller in electing Lennar directors and approving matters that are presented to its
stockholders. Mr. Miller’s voting power might discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in Lennar, even if Lennar needed the
investment to meet its obligations or to operate its businesses. Mr. Miller has voting power with regard to only 0.73% of the Class A common stock
voting separately.

Liquidation Rights

In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of Lennar, after satisfaction of all of its debts and liabilities, holders of preferred stock, which we
refer to as the “Lennar preferred stockholders,” will be entitled to the

Table of Contents

payment of liquidating distributions in the amounts to which they are preferentially entitled before any liquidating distributions are made to the holders
of participating preferred stock, which we refer to as the “Lennar participating preferred stockholders,” or the Lennar stockholders. Thereafter, if any
Lennar participating preferred stock is outstanding, liquidating distributions totaling $10.00 per share will be paid to Lennar participating preferred
stockholders before any liquidating distributions are made to the holders of the Class A or Class B common stock. Next, the Lennar Class A and Class B
stockholders will be entitled to liquidating distributions totaling $10.00 per share before any additional liquidating distributions are made with regard to
the Lennar participating preferred stockholders. Any liquidating distributions in excess of $10.00 per share will be made on an equal per share basis to
the holders of any outstanding participating preferred stock and the holders of the Class A and Class B common stock.

Termination of Class B common stock

If at any time (i) the number of outstanding shares of Lennar’s Class B common stock is less than 10% of the number of outstanding shares of
Class A common stock and Class B common stock taken together, or (ii) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock
vote to cause all the Class B common stock to be converted into Class A common stock, the Class B common stock will automatically be converted into,
and become for all purposes, shares of Class A common stock, and Lennar will no longer be authorized to issue Class B common stock.

No Other Rights

Lennar stockholders are not entitled to preemptive, redemption, subscription or conversion rights other than as described above. The rights,
preferences and privileges of Lennar stockholders could be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of Lennar preferred stockholders or
Lennar participating preferred stockholders that may exist in the future.

Description of Preferred Stock

Lennar may issue preferred stock in series with any rights and preferences that are specified by the Lennar board with regard to the particular
series. Currently there is no preferred stock outstanding. The rights and preferences of a series may (or may not) include:
 

 •  preferential rights to receive distributions if Lennar is liquidated;
 

 
•  the right to require Lennar to redeem shares at specified dates, upon the occurrence of specified events, or at the option of the holder at any

time;
 

 •  preferential voting rights, including, possibly, the right to elect by separate vote directors to the Lennar board;
 

 
•  the right to receive specified dividends before any dividends can be paid on the common stock or on junior series of preferred stock (which

preferential dividend right may be fixed or may participate with dividends on other classes or series of stock and may be cumulative or may
apply separately to individual dividends);

 

 
•  the right to convert shares into another class or series of Lennar stock or other securities, and provisions intended to prevent dilution of those

conversion rights;
 

 
•  provisions requiring Lennar to make payments into a sinking fund which will be used to redeem shares of the series or a purchase fund

which will be used to purchase shares of the series; or
 

 •  any other rights or preferences the Lennar board deems appropriate.

Lennar preferred stockholders will not have preemptive rights under Lennar’s certificate of incorporation or under the DGCL, but the terms of
particular series of preferred stock, or agreements into which Lennar enters when it sells shares of preferred stock, may give rights that are similar to
preemptive rights.

Table of Contents

Description of Participating Preferred Stock

Lennar may issue participating preferred stock which will have rights and preferences identical to those of the Class A common stock in every
way, except that (a) no cash dividends may be paid with regard to the Class A or Class B common stock in a calendar year until the Lennar participating
preferred stockholders have received cash dividends totaling $0.0125 per share, and after such cash dividends are paid, then no further cash dividends
may be paid in that year with regard to the participating preferred stock until the Lennar Class A stockholders have received cash dividends totaling
$0.0125 per share, after which any additional cash dividends in the year will be paid on an equal per share basis on the outstanding participating
preferred stock and the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, (b) if Lennar is liquidated, none of its assets may be distributed to the Lennar
Class A or Class B common stockholders until the Lennar participating preferred stockholders have received distributions totaling $10.00 per share, and
after those liquidating distributions are made, then no further assets may be distributed to the Lennar participating preferred stockholders until the
Lennar Class A stockholders and Lennar Class B stockholders have received distributions totaling $10.00 per share, after which any liquidating
distributions in excess of $10.00 per share will be made to the participating preferred stockholders and the Lennar Class A stockholders and Lennar
Class B stockholders on an equal per share basis without regard to class, and (c) Lennar participating preferred stockholders will vote together with
Lennar Class A stockholders and Lennar Class B stockholders, except that the Lennar participating preferred stockholders will vote separately on
corporate actions which would change the participating preferred stock or would cause the Lennar participating preferred stockholders to receive per
share consideration in a merger or similar transaction which is different from the per share consideration received by the Lennar Class  A stockholders.
Currently there is no participating preferred stock outstanding.

Anti-Takeover Effects of Lennar’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws

Lennar’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws have provisions, in addition to the multiple voting rights of the Class B common stock, that may
have the effect of making takeovers of Lennar more difficult. They include the following:

Advance Notice Requirements. Lennar’s bylaws contain a requirement that stockholders give advance notice of their intention to nominate
candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual or special meeting of stockholders. These bylaw provisions may prevent
some matters from being voted upon at a meeting. They may prevent or deter a potential acquiror from soliciting proxies to elect a slate of directors
selected by the potential acquiror or otherwise attempting to obtain control of Lennar.

Lennar’s bylaws also provide that its stockholders must meet requirements set forth in the bylaws to be able to request that the Lennar board set a
record date for action to be taken by written consent of stockholders. This provision may discourage or limit the ability of a potential acquiror to cause
the stockholders to act by written consent in order to make it easier for the potential acquiror to advance a takeover proposal.

Calling of Special Meetings of Stockholders. Lennar’s bylaws provide that special meetings of its stockholders may be called by stockholders only
by notice given by Lennar’s president or secretary upon the written request of the holders of at least a majority of all the outstanding shares of any class
entitled to vote on the action proposed to be taken. These provisions may impede a stockholder’s ability to bring matters before a special meeting of
stockholders.

Undesignated Preferred Stock. The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for the Lennar board to issue preferred
stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire Lennar. These and other provisions may have the
effect of deterring or preventing hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of Lennar.

Board Authority to Amend Bylaws. Under Lennar’s bylaws, the Lennar board has the authority to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws without the
approval of its stockholders.

Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute

Lennar is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held Delaware
corporation from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an interested stockholder of the corporation for a period of three
years following the time the person became an interested stockholder unless:
 

 
•  prior to the time that the person became an interested stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business

combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;
 

 

•  upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the stockholder owned at least 85%
of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number
of shares outstanding (1) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and (2) shares owned by employee stock plans in
which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in
response to a tender or exchange offer; or

 

 
•  on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or

special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 % of the outstanding voting stock
which is not owned by the interested stockholder.

For the purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a
financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who owns 15% or more of a corporation’s outstanding voting
securities or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, owned 15%
or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting securities, as well as affiliates and associates of such a person. The existence of this provision may have
an antitakeover effect with respect to transactions the Lennar board does not approve in advance. Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might
result in a premium over the market price of shares of Lennar’s capital stock.

Transfer Agent and Registrar

The transfer agent and registrar for the Class A common stock and Class B common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. of Canton,
Massachusetts.

COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS OF CALATLANTIC AND LENNAR

Both Lennar and CalAtlantic are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and, accordingly, the rights of the stockholders of each of
them are governed by the DGCL. The combined company will continue to be a Delaware corporation following completion of the Merger and will be
governed by the DGCL.

Upon completion of the Merger, CalAtlantic stockholders will become Lennar stockholders (except for CalAtlantic stockholders who elected and
receive only cash). The rights of the former CalAtlantic stockholders and the Lennar stockholders will therefore be governed by the DGCL and by the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Lennar, each as amended from time to time.

The following description summarizes the material differences that may affect the rights of the stockholders of Lennar and CalAtlantic, but is not
a complete statement of all those differences, or a complete description of the specific provisions referred to in this summary. CalAtlantic stockholders
should read carefully the relevant provisions of the DGCL, the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus titled “Description of Lennar Capital
Stock” beginning on page 119 and the respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Lennar and CalAtlantic. For more information on how to
obtain the documents that are not attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, see “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page
133.

Authorized
Capital Stock

  

The authorized capital stock of CalAtlantic consists of
600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per shares, of which 1,000,000 shares have been
designated Series A Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred
Stock.

  

The authorized capital stock of Lennar is 490,500,000
shares. Of these, 300,000,000 shares are classified as
Class A common stock, par value $0.10 per share,
90,000,000 shares are classified as Class B common
stock, par value $0.10 per share, 100,000,000 shares are
classified as participating preferred stock, par value $0.10
per share, and 500,000 shares are classified as preferred
stock, par value $10.00 per share.
 

If the Lennar Authorized Share Proposal is approved, the
total number of shares Lennar is authorized to issue will
be increased to 590,500,000 shares and the number of
authorized shares classified as Class A common stock
will be increased to 400,000,000 shares.

Outstanding
Capital Stock

  

CalAtlantic has outstanding only one class of common stock.
CalAtlantic stockholders are entitled to all of the respective
rights and obligations provided to common stockholders
under Delaware law and CalAtlantic’s certificate of
incorporation and bylaws.
 

As of January 4, 2018, 116,190,785 shares of common stock
were outstanding. No shares of CalAtlantic preferred stock
were outstanding and CalAtlantic has no present

  

Lennar has outstanding two classes of common stock:
Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The
two classes are substantially identical, except that the
Class A common stock entitles holders to one vote per
share and the Class B common stock entitles holders to
10 votes per share.
 

As of January 4, 2018, 203,952,285 shares of Class A
common stock and 36,007,774 shares of Class B
common stock were outstanding.

Special Meetings of
Stockholders   

Under the DGCL, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the board of directors or by any other person
authorized to do so in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

  

CalAtlantic’s certificate of incorporation provides that special
meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time by a
majority of the board of directors or by a committee of the
board of directors to which the board has granted authority to
call such meetings. In addition, CalAtlantic’s Secretary must
call a special meeting if holders of record of a majority of
outstanding CalAtlantic common stock request that a special
meeting be called and otherwise comply with the procedures
for calling a meeting set forth in CalAtlantic’s bylaws.

  

Lennar’s bylaws provide that a special meeting of
stockholders may be called by the Lennar board of
directors or by Lennar’s chief executive officer. Lennar’s
bylaws also provide that a special meeting of
stockholders must be called by the president or the
secretary upon the written request of a majority of the
Lennar board of directors or upon the written request of
the holders of a majority of all the outstanding shares of
any class entitled to vote on the action proposed to be
taken.

Stockholder Proposals
and Nominations of
Candidates for Election
to the Board of
Directors

  

CalAtlantic’s bylaws allow stockholders to propose business
to be brought before an annual meeting and allow
stockholders who are entitled to vote in the election of
directors to nominate candidates for election to the
CalAtlantic board.
 

Such proposals and nominations, however, may only be
brought by a stockholder who has given timely notice in
proper written form to CalAtlantic’s secretary prior to the
meeting.
 

In connection with an annual meeting, to be timely, notice of
such proposals and nominations must be received at
CalAtlantic’s principal executive offices not less than 90 days
nor more than 120 days prior to the one-year anniversary of
the preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that
if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before
or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice by
the stockholder must be received no earlier than the 120th day
prior to the annual meeting, and no later than the later of the
90th day before the meeting or the 7th day following the day
on which   

Lennar’s bylaws allow stockholders to propose business
to be brought before an annual meeting and allow
stockholders who are entitled to vote in the election of
directors to nominate candidates for election to the
Lennar board of directors.
 

Such proposals and nominations, however, may only be
made by a stockholder who has given timely notice in
proper written form to Lennar’s secretary prior to the
meeting and who, at the time of giving such notice and at
the time of the meeting, owns, and for at least one year
has owned, of record and beneficially (or is acting on
behalf of a beneficial owner who owns and for at least
one year has owned beneficially) at least $2,000 in
market value or 1% of the outstanding common stock of
Lennar of both classes combined.
 

In connection with an annual meeting, to be timely,
notice of nominations or proposals and nominations must

meeting, or the 10th day following the date of the first
public announcement of the date of the special meeting
and the nominees proposed by the Lennar board of
directors to be elected at the special meeting.

Stockholder Action by
Written Consent

  

The DGCL allows action by written consent to be taken by the holders of the minimum number of votes that would be
needed to approve such a matter at an annual or special meeting of stockholders if all shares entitled to vote thereat were
present and voted, unless this right to act by written consent is denied in the certificate of incorporation.

  

CalAtlantic’s certificate of incorporation provides that, subject
to any rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to
act by written consent as set forth in the applicable certificate
of designations, the stockholders may act by written consent if
the consent is unanimous and each stockholder that is entitled
to notice of the stockholders’ meeting but not entitled to vote
at it provides a written waiver of any right to dissent.   

Lennar’s bylaws provide that the stockholders may act by
written consent if the action is consented to by the
holders of shares on a record date fixed by the Lennar
board of directors having at least the minimum number of
votes that would be required to authorize the action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote were present
and voted.

Number of Directors
  

The DGCL provides that the board of directors of a Delaware corporation must consist of one or more directors as fixed
by the corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

  

CalAtlantic’s bylaws provide that the number of directors
constituting the entire CalAtlantic board of directors will not

the Specified Period (as defined in the bylaws), the board of
directors will be comprised of ten members, including five
Continuing Ryland Directors (as defined in the bylaws) and
five Continuing Standard Pacific Directors (as defined in the
bylaws). CalAtlantic’s certificate of incorporation provides
that during any period in which the holders of any one or
more series of preferred stock, voting as a class, shall be
entitled to elect a specified number of directors by reason of
dividend arrearages or other contingencies giving them the
right to do so, then the then authorized number of directors
shall be increased by such specified number of directors.
There are currently ten directors serving on the board.   

board of directors will be determined from time to time
by the directors but will be not less than three nor more
than fifteen directors. There are currently ten directors
serving on the board of directors.

Election of Directors
  

The DGCL provides that, unless the certificate of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, directors will be elected by
a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon.

  

CalAtlantic’s bylaws provide that a director nominee is
elected if the number of votes cast for the nominee’s election
exceeds the number of votes cast against the nominee’s
election; provided, however, that directors shall be elected by
a plurality of the votes cast (i) if the number of director
candidates exceeds the number of directors to be exceeded
and (ii) during the Specified Period, as defined in
CalAtlantic’s certificate of incorporation. Any vacancy on the
CalAtlantic board of directors (whether resulting from an
increase in the total number of directors or the departure of
one of the directors) may be filled by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though
less than a quorum; provided however that the bylaws and
certificate of incorporation of CalAtlantic provide that
whenever the holders of any class or series of shares are
entitled to elect one or more directors, any vacancy or newly
created directorship of such class or series may be filled by a
majority of the directors elected   

Lennar’s bylaws provide that a director nominee is
elected by a plurality of the votes cast. Any vacancy on
the Lennar board of directors (whether resulting from an
increase in the total number of directors or the departure
of one of the directors) may be filled by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in
office, even though less than a quorum. Directors are
elected annually and hold office until their successors are
duly elected and qualified.

Limitation on Liability

CalAtlantic’s certificate of incorporation provides that, to the
maximum extent permitted by the DGCL, no director of
CalAtlantic will be personally liable to CalAtlantic or any of
its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director of CalAtlantic.

  

Lennar’s certificate of incorporation provides that no
director of Lennar will be personally liable to Lennar or
any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty as a director of Lennar to the fullest
extent permitted by law; provided, however, that personal
liability of a director will not be eliminated or limited

or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good
faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the
DGCL or (iv) for any transactions from which such

Indemnification of
Directors and Officers

  

Under the DGCL, a Delaware corporation must indemnify its present or former directors and officers against expenses

on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding brought against him or her by reason of the fact
that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation.

  

The DGCL generally permits a Delaware corporation to indemnify directors and officers against expenses (including
attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of any action or suit for actions taken in good faith and
in a manner they reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to
any criminal action, which they had no reasonable cause to believe was unlawful; provided, that in an action by or in the
right of the corporation such indemnification is limited to expenses (including attorneys’ fees).

another entity. Lennar may indemnify any person made
party to a proceeding by reason of the fact that the person
is or was an employee or agent of Lennar.

    

The DGCL and Lennar’s certificate of incorporation and
bylaws permit Lennar to maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee or agent of Lennar or another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against
any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not Lennar
would have the power to indemnify such person against
such expense, liability or loss under applicable law.

DATES FOR SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2018 ANNUAL MEETINGS

Lennar

Lennar stockholder proposals should be sent to the Office of the General Counsel at Lennar Corporation, 700 Northwest 107th Avenue, Miami,
Florida 33172. To be considered for inclusion in Lennar’s proxy statement for the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, the deadline for submission of
stockholder proposals was November 7, 2017, pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as “Rule
14a-8.” Additionally, pursuant to Lennar’s bylaws, Lennar must receive notice of any stockholder proposal to be submitted at the 2018 annual meeting
of stockholders, but not required to be included in Lennar’s proxy statement, no earlier than December 19, 2017 and no later than January 18, 2018.
Lennar’s bylaws and the Charter of its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee describe the information that is required in a written notice of
a stockholder proposal.

CalAtlantic

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the CalAtlantic board of directors knows of no matters that will be presented for
consideration at the CalAtlantic special meeting other than as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Under CalAtlantic’s bylaws,
CalAtlantic stockholders are not permitted to propose business to be brought before a special meeting of the CalAtlantic stockholders.

If the Merger is completed, there will be no CalAtlantic annual meeting of stockholders for 2018. In that case, stockholder proposals must be
submitted to Lennar’s Corporate Secretary in accordance with procedures described above.

In case the Merger is not completed, any eligible stockholder of CalAtlantic wishing to have a proposal considered for inclusion in CalAtlantic’s
2018 proxy solicitation materials pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 must set forth such proposal in writing and submit it to CalAtlantic’s
Corporate Secretary on or before November 30, 2017. The CalAtlantic board of directors will review proposals from eligible stockholders if they are
received by such date and will determine whether such proposals will be included in CalAtlantic’s 2018 proxy solicitation materials. Under Rule 14a-8 a
stockholder is eligible to present proposals to the board of directors if he or she is the record or beneficial owner of at least one percent, or $2,000 in
market value, of company securities entitled to be voted at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders and has held such securities for at least one year,
and he or she continues to own such securities through the date on which the meeting is held. Proposals must be submitted in accordance with Rule
14a-8.

In case the Merger is not completed, if a CalAtlantic stockholder desires to have a proposal presented or nominate a director candidate at
CalAtlantic’s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders and the proposal is not intended to be included in CalAtlantic’s 2018 proxy solicitation materials, the
stockholder must give advance notice to CalAtlantic in accordance with CalAtlantic’s bylaws. According to the bylaws of CalAtlantic, in order for a
stockholder proposal to be properly brought before any meeting of CalAtlantic stockholders, the stockholder must give notice of the proposal in writing
to CalAtlantic’s Corporate Secretary at CalAtlantic’s principal executive offices by not later than February 9, 2018 nor earlier than January 10, 2018. All
stockholder proposals must include the information required by CalAtlantic’s bylaws. CalAtlantic stockholders may contact CalAtlantic’s Corporate
Secretary at the address set forth below for a copy of CalAtlantic’s bylaw provisions that set forth the requirements for making stockholder proposals
and nominating director candidates.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF LENNAR AND CALATLANTIC

Lennar and CalAtlantic entered into the merger agreement on October 29, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, CalAtlantic will
be merged with and into Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar. Upon completion of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
CalAtlantic will cease, and Merger Sub will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger.

The following presents the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheets of Lennar and CalAtlantic, giving effect to the Merger as if it
had been consummated on August 31, 2017. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended
August 31, 2017 and for the year ended November 30, 2016 present the historical consolidated statements of operations of Lennar and CalAtlantic,
giving effect to the Merger as if it had been consummated on December 1, 2015, the beginning of the earliest period presented.

The unaudited pro forma financial statements also give effect to the Senior Notes Offering as though it had occurred as of the same date as the
Merger.

Lennar’s fiscal year ends on November 30, and CalAtlantic’s fiscal year ends on December 31. As a consequence of Lennar’s and CalAtlantic’s
different fiscal years:
 

 
•  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of August 31, 2017 combines Lennar’s historical unaudited condensed

consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2017, which was the end of Lennar’s third fiscal quarter, and CalAtlantic’s historical unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2017, which was the end of CalAtlantic’s third fiscal quarter.

 

 

•  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended August 31, 2017 combines Lennar’s
historical unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended August 31, 2017, which were the first three
quarters of Lennar’s current fiscal year, and CalAtlantic’s historical unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2017, which were the first three quarters of CalAtlantic’s current fiscal year.

 

 

•  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2016 combines Lennar’s historical
audited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2016, which was Lennar’s most recently
completed fiscal year, and CalAtlantic’s historical audited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
2016, which was CalAtlantic’s most recently completed fiscal year.

The historical consolidated financial statements of CalAtlantic have been adjusted to reflect certain reclassifications in order to conform with
Lennar’s financial statement presentation. For a description of the reclassifications, see Note 4 to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with
Regulation S-X Article 11, which gives effect to the Merger under ASC 805, Business Combinations, with Lennar considered as the accounting acquiror
and CalAtlantic as the accounting acquiree. Accordingly, consideration paid by Lennar to complete the Merger will be allocated to identifiable assets
and liabilities of CalAtlantic based on their estimated fair values as of the closing date of the Merger.

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Lennar has not engaged a consultant to assist with the fair value measurements of the
acquired assets and liabilities; as such, the fair value measurements have not been completed as of the date of this filing, accordingly, the detailed
valuation studies necessary to arrive at the required estimates of the fair value of the CalAtlantic assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed
are

Table of Contents

preliminary and subject to completion. In addition, there may be additional adjustments necessary to conform CalAtlantic’s accounting policies to
Lennar’s accounting policies. A final determination of the fair value of CalAtlantic’s assets and liabilities will be based on the actual net tangible and
intangible assets and liabilities of CalAtlantic that exist as of the date of completion of the Merger and, therefore, cannot be made prior to the completion
of the transaction. Additionally, the value of the consideration to be given by Lennar to complete the Merger will be determined based on the trading
prices of Lennar’s Class A and Class B common stock at the time of the completion of the Merger. Accordingly, the pro forma purchase price
adjustments are preliminary and are subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed.
The preliminary pro forma purchase price adjustments have been made solely for the purpose of providing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements presented below. Lennar has estimated the fair value of CalAtlantic’s assets and liabilities based on discussions with CalAtlantic’s
management, preliminary analyses, due diligence and information presented in public filings. Until the Merger is completed, Lennar and CalAtlantic are
limited in their ability to share information; thus, there currently is not sufficient information for a definitive measurement and the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements presented herein are preliminary. Upon completion of the Merger, final valuations will be performed.
Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final valuations and acquisition accounting will occur and these differences could have a
material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the combined future results of operations and
financial position.

These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been developed from and should be read in conjunction with (1) the
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Lennar and CalAtlantic contained in their respective Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended August 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and (2) the audited consolidated financial statements of Lennar and
CalAtlantic contained in their respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, respectively, all
of which are incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are
provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial
position of Lennar would have been had the Merger occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of
operations or consolidated financial position.

Lennar expects to incur significant costs associated with integrating the operations of Lennar and CalAtlantic. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of future cost savings from
operating efficiencies or revenue synergies expected to result from the Merger. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements exclude non-recurring items that are directly attributable to the Merger, employee retention costs or professional fees incurred by Lennar or
CalAtlantic pursuant to provisions contained in the merger agreement, as those costs are not considered part of the purchase price.

Lennar Corporation
Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

1. Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X Article 11 which gives
effect to the Merger under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”) using the acquisition method of
accounting giving effect to the Merger involving Lennar and CalAtlantic, with Lennar as the acquirer. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position had the Merger been
consummated at August 31, 2017 or the results of operations had the Merger been consummated at December 1, 2015, nor is it necessarily indicative of
the results of operations in future periods or the future financial position of the combined entities.

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of CalAtlantic will be recorded at the respective fair values on the Merger
date. The fair value on the Merger date represents management’s best estimates based on available information and facts and circumstances in existence
on the Merger date. The pro forma allocation of purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is
preliminary and subject to adjustment. Adjustments may include, but not be limited to, changes in (i) the underlying values of assets and liabilities if
market conditions differ from current assumptions; or (ii) if information unknown as of the completion of the Merger becomes known.

The accounting policies of both Lennar and CalAtlantic are in the process of being reviewed in detail. Upon completion of such review,
conforming adjustments or financial statement reclassification may be determined.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect the preliminary valuation of the net assets acquired
including goodwill. The valuation of the assets and liabilities in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements is based upon a
purchase price of approximately $6.2 billion. This amount was derived as described below, based on the outstanding shares of CalAtlantic common
stock at September 30, 2017, and in accordance with the merger agreement, pursuant to which CalAtlantic’s stockholders will receive 0.885 shares of
Lennar’s Class A common stock for each share of CalAtlantic’s common stock, and as discussed below, shares of Lennar’s Class B common stock.
Based on a Lennar Class A common stock close price of $62.36 on December 18, 2017, each CalAtlantic common share would have a value of $55.19
based on the exchange ratio. CalAtlantic’s stockholders will also receive one share of Class B common stock for every 50 shares of Class A common
stock issued as merger consideration. The actual number of shares of Lennar’s Class A and Class B common stock to be issued in the Merger will be
based upon the actual number of CalAtlantic shares outstanding when the Merger becomes effective, and the valuation of those shares will be based on
the trading prices of Lennar’s Class A and Class B common stock, as applicable, when the Merger becomes effective. The purchase price also includes
the estimated fair value of outstanding equity awards held by employees of CalAtlantic, some of which will become fully vested as of the date of the
Merger and will entitle the holders to receive Lennar Class A common stock, adjusted for the 0.885 exchange ratio, and Lennar Class B common stock
based on the 0.0177 exchange ratio. Accordingly, the purchase price includes an estimated fair value of equity awards to be issued by Lennar of
approximately $77 million. Per share information takes account of the fact that, as a result of elections, or a deemed election, CalAtlantic stockholders
will receive cash of $48.26 per share, instead of Lennar stock, with regard to 24,083,091 shares of CalAtlantic common stock.

Lennar’s fiscal year ends on November 30, and CalAtlantic’s fiscal year ends on December 31. As a consequence of Lennar’s and CalAtlantic’s
different fiscal years:
 

 
•  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of August 31, 2017 combines Lennar’s historical unaudited condensed

consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2017, which was the end of

2016, which was CalAtlantic’s most recently completed fiscal year.

2. Estimated Merger and Integration Costs

In connection with the Merger, the plan to integrate Lennar’s and CalAtlantic’s operations is still being developed. Lennar expects to incur
significant costs associated with integrating the operations of Lennar and CalAtlantic. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of future cost savings from expected operating
efficiencies or synergies. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements exclude non-recurring items that are directly
attributable to the Merger, employee retention costs or professional fees incurred by Lennar or CalAtlantic in connection with the Merger. Over the next
several months, the specific details of these plans will continue to be refined. Lennar and CalAtlantic are currently in the process of assessing their
respective businesses to determine where they may eliminate potential redundancies. Lennar expects to incur Merger-related expenses including system
conversion costs, employee retention and severance agreements, communications to customers, and others. To the extent there are costs associated with
these actions, the costs will be recorded based on the nature and timing of these integration actions. Most acquisition and restructuring costs are
recognized separately from a business combination and generally will be expensed as incurred. We currently estimate that the Merger-related costs will
be approximately $170 million and expect they will be incurred primarily in fiscal year 2018: these estimated costs are not reflected in the
accompanying pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2017, but are reflected in
the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of August 31, 2017.

3. Pro Forma Merger Adjustments

The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. All taxable
adjustments were calculated using a 39% tax rate to arrive at deferred tax asset or liability adjustments. All adjustments are based on current
assumptions and valuations, which are subject to change.

Table of Contents

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect the following adjustments:

Balance Sheet
 
(Dollars in thousands)     
A. Adjustments to Cash and Cash Equivalents   
Lennar estimates that its expenses for the Merger will be approximately $70 million, which will be reflected as an expense of Lennar

in the period the expense is incurred. These costs include fees for investment banking services, legal, accounting, due diligence, tax,
valuation, printing and other various services necessary to complete the transaction. These estimated expenses of Lennar are
reflected in the pro forma balance sheet as of August 31, 2017 as a reduction to cash and a decrease to retained earnings. These
estimated expenses are not reflected in the pro forma statement of operations as they are non-recurring charges which result directly
from the Merger. The pro forma financial statements do not reflect any potential termination fees that could be required if the
Merger was not completed   $ (70,000) 

Each of CalAtlantic’s executive officers is a party to an executive severance agreement, under which the executive will have the right
to receive a lump sum cash payment (and other benefits) if the executive’s employment is terminated without “cause” or the
executive resigns for “good reason.” Lennar expects to incur change of control costs of approximately $100 million relating to
certain executive officers of CalAtlantic and severance payments. These estimated expenses of Lennar are reflected in the pro
forma balance sheet as of August 31, 2017 as a reduction to cash and a decrease to retained earnings. These cash payments are not
reflected in the pro forma statement of operations as they are non-recurring charges which result directly from the Merger    (100,000) 

To reflect portion of purchase price assumed to be paid in cash    (1,162,229) 
    

 

  $(1,332,229) 
    

 

Change in Control Payments:

Under the merger agreement, CalAtlantic options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock appreciation rights will entitle holders to
acquire upon exercise shares of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock equal to (i) the number of shares of CalAtlantic common stock as to which
they are exercised times the number of shares of Lennar Class A and Class B common stock issuable as merger consideration with regard to a share of
CalAtlantic common stock, with appropriate adjustments to exercise prices of options and stock appreciation rights, unless particular options, RSUs,
PSUs or stock appreciation rights provide for different treatment. When the Merger takes place, all performance based vesting requirements with regard
to RSUs will be deemed to be satisfied at the target level. Also, change of control agreements with some CalAtlantic employees will cause all options
and other incentives to vest at the time of the Merger.
 
B. Adjustments to Inventories   
To reflect fair value adjustments of inventories owned. Inventories owned (excluding homes in backlog) were adjusted to their

estimated fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. This evaluation and the
assumptions used by Lennar’s management to determine fair value required a substantial degree of judgment, especially with
respect to real estate projects that have a substantial amount of development to be completed, have not started selling or are in the
early stages of sales, or are longer-term in duration. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and the time required
to properly evaluate the fair value of the assets acquired, significant volatility in the demand for new housing, and the availability of
mortgage financing for potential homebuyers, the fair value of the inventory to be acquired in the Merger may fluctuate
significantly between August 31, 2017 and the final completion of the Merger   $ (304,805)

5. Pro Forma Senior Notes Offering Adjustments

The following pro forma Senior Notes Offering adjustments have been reflected in a separate column in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information. All taxable adjustments were calculated using the estimated combined pro forma tax rate of 35.3%. The pro forma
financial statements take into account Lennar’s issuance of $1.2 billion principal amount of senior notes that were closed on November 29, 2017 to fund
a portion of the Cash Election Option payable by us in connection with the Merger and a portion of the related transaction costs and expenses and
general corporate purposes. For purposes of the preliminary pro forma condensed combined statement of operations, Lennar has assumed such
indebtedness is outstanding throughout all periods presented. All adjustments are based on current assumptions and valuations, which are subject to
change.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect the following adjustments:

Assuming capitalization of interest at the beginning of the period and the
Company’s current cycle time of approximately five months, $30.1 million and

Table of Contents

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and their respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

AGREEMENT

ARTICLE 1
THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time described in Section 2.3, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub, the separate existence of
the Company will terminate, and Merger Sub will continue as the corporation that survives the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”). The Merger will
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, when the
Merger becomes effective, (i) the real and personal property, other assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and franchises of Merger Sub
will continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger and will be the property, other assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and
franchises of the Surviving Corporation, (ii) the separate existence of the Company will terminate, and the Company’s real and personal property, other
assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and franchises will be merged into the Surviving Corporation, and (iii) the Merger will have the
other effects specified in Section 259 of the DGCL.

1.2 Certificate of Incorporation. From the Effective Time until it is subsequently amended, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation will be the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time, except that it will provide that the
name of the Surviving Corporation will be “CalAtlantic Group, Inc.” That Certificate of Incorporation, separate and apart from this Agreement, may be
certified as the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

1.3 By-Laws. From the Effective Time until they are subsequently amended or repealed, the bylaws of Merger Sub immediately before the
Effective Time will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4 Directors. The directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time and will hold office in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

1.5 Officers. The officers of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time and will hold office until they resign or are removed or replaced by the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation.

1.6 Stock of the Company.

(a) Subject to Sections 1.6(c), 1.14 and 1.15, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder
of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, each share of common stock of the Company (“Company Common Stock”), par
value $0.01 per share, which is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will be converted into and become the right to receive either (i)
0.885 duly authorized and issued and fully paid and non-assessable shares (the “Merger Consideration”) of Class A common stock of Parent
(“Parent Class A Stock”), par value $0.10 per share (the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock to be issued with regard to a share of
Company Common Stock being the “Exchange Ratio”) or (ii) the Cash Payment Amount pursuant to Section 1.15.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company, and each share of Company Common Stock held by

Table of Contents

Parent or Merger Sub, immediately before the Effective Time (collectively, “Excluded Shares”) will, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and
cease to exist and no Merger Consideration will be issued with respect to any of those shares.

(c) No fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock will be issued as a result of the Merger. Any holder of Company Common Stock who, but
for this Section 1.6(c), would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Class A Stock will receive, instead of that fraction of a share,
cash equal to the Closing Date Market Value of a share of Parent Class A Stock times that fraction (which fraction shall be rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form). The “Closing Date Market Value” of a share of Parent Class A stock will be the last sale price
reported on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) on the last NYSE trading day before the Closing Date.

1.7 Shares of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, all the common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Merger Sub (“Merger Sub Stock”) which is
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation (“Surviving Corporation Stock”). At the Effective Time, any certificate or other document which evidenced shares of Merger Sub Stock
will automatically become and be a certificate or other document evidencing the same number of shares of Surviving Corporation Stock.

1.8 Preferred Share Purchase Rights. At the Effective Time, all the Preferred Share Purchase Rights (“Preferred Share Rights”) that have been
issued under the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2011, between the Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC,
as Rights Agent, as amended (including to substitute Computershare Inc., as successor Rights Agent) (the “Rights Agreement”), will be cancelled and
will cease to exist, and no additional Merger Consideration or any other consideration will be issued or paid with regard to the Preferred Share Rights.

1.9 Company Convertible Debt. At the Effective Time, all outstanding debt of the Company which, by its terms, is convertible into Company
Common Stock will remain outstanding and unaffected by the Merger, except that the holder of such debt will receive, on conversion of the convertible
debt held by it, the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock equal to (a) the number of shares of Company Common Stock the holder would have
received if the Merger had not taken place multiplied by (b) the Exchange Ratio; unless the indenture relating to a particular issue of convertible debt
provides otherwise, in which case the holder of convertible debt of that issue will receive what is provided in the indenture.

1.10 Warrants. At the Effective Time, each warrant issued by the Company which is outstanding at that time, will remain outstanding, and will be
exercisable and will expire in accordance with its terms, except that when it is exercised with respect to a specified number of shares of Company
Common Stock, the holder will receive, instead of that number of shares of Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration for that number of
shares of Company Common Stock and the exercise price per share thereof will be correspondingly adjusted.

1.11 Options. At the Effective Time, each option (each, a “Company Option”) to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be automatically
converted into an option to acquire shares of Parent Class A Stock (a “Parent Merger Option”), on the same terms and conditions (including any
vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration thereof pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant equity
plans of the Company or applicable award agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby) as were applicable under such Company
Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 1.11. The number of shares of Parent Class A
Stock subject to the Parent Merger Option into which a Company Option is converted shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the
nearest whole share of Parent Class A Stock, and such Parent Merger Option shall have an exercise price per full share of Parent Class A Stock

Table of Contents

equal to (A) the exercise price of the Company Option per share of Company Common Stock divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up, if
necessary, to the nearest whole cent; provided, that (1) in the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the Effective
Time by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock subject to such
option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code; and (2) the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock subject to, and the terms and conditions of exercise of each Parent Merger
Option shall also be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance sufficient shares of Parent Class A Stock for delivery upon exercise of Parent Merger
Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), with respect to the shares of Parent Class A Stock subject to such options and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such
options remain outstanding.

1.12 Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units. At the Effective Time, each time-based or performance-based restricted stock unit
award granted under the equity plans of the Company (each, a “Company RSU”) representing the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be
converted into a right to receive shares of Parent Class A Stock (a “Parent Merger RSU”), on the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or
forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration or other deemed satisfaction thereof pursuant to the existing terms of
the relevant equity plans of the Company or applicable award agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby) as were applicable under
such Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The number of shares of Parent Class A Stock subject to the Parent Merger RSU into
which a Company RSU is converted shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Class A Stock. At the
Effective Time all performance-based vesting criteria to which any outstanding Company RSUs are subject for which the performance period has not
yet been completed as of the Effective Time shall be deemed achieved at the target performance level. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance sufficient shares of Parent Class A Stock for delivery upon the vesting and settlement of Parent
Merger RSUs. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Parent Class A Stock subject to such restricted stock units and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein)
for so long as such restricted stock units remain outstanding.

1.13 Stock Appreciation Rights. At the Effective Time, each stock appreciation right of the Company (each, a “Company SAR”) based on shares
of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent a right based on
the shares of Company Common Stock and shall be automatically converted into a right based on the shares of Parent Class A Stock (a “Parent Merger
SAR”), on the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration
thereof pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant equity plans of the Company or applicable award agreement by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby) as were applicable under such Company SAR as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to adjustment as provided in
this Section 1.13. The number of shares of Parent Class A Stock to which the Parent Merger SAR into which a Company SAR is converted relates shall
be equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock to which the Company SAR related immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied
by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Parent Class A Stock, and such Parent Merger SAR shall have an
exercise price per full share of Parent Class A Stock equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of the Company SAR divided
by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest whole cent; provided, that the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Class A

Stock to which the Parent Merger SAR relates, and the terms and conditions of exercise of the Parent Merger SAR shall also be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. If the holders of Parent Merger SARs are entitled to receive shares of Parent Class A
Stock on exercise of the Parent Merger SARs, at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
sufficient shares of Parent Class A Stock for delivery upon exercise of Parent Merger SARs, and as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Parent Class A Stock that may
be issuable on exercise of Parent Merger SARs and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such stock appreciation rights remain
outstanding.

1.14 Adjustments.

(a) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or any or all classes of
Parent Stock are changed into a different number of shares or a different type of securities by reason of a reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares, conversion or similar event, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities is declared with regard to the
Company Common Stock or the Parent Stock with a record date between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio
will be adjusted so that the Merger will have the same economic effect on the holders of Company Common Stock as that contemplated by this
Agreement if there had been no such reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange, conversion, similar event or dividend, and as
so adjusted will, from and after the date of such event, be the Exchange Ratio, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this
Section 1.14(a). For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent Class B Dividend completed in accordance with Section 1.14(b) shall be governed by such
section and shall not result in an adjustment to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this Section 1.14(a).

(b) Without limiting the generality of what is said in Section 1.14(a), if Parent issues shares of its Class B common stock (“Parent Class B
Stock” and, together with the Parent Class A Stock, the “Parent Stock”), par value $0.10 per share, as a dividend with regard to the Parent Stock,
that is payable to holders of record thereof on a date between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (the “Parent Class B Dividend”),
(i) the Merger Consideration will include, in addition to the Parent Class A Stock described in Section 1.6, the number of shares of Parent Class B
Stock that would have been issued as a dividend on the Parent Class A Stock included in the Merger Consideration if that Parent Class A Stock
had been outstanding on the record date for the dividend, (ii) each reference in this Article 1 to Parent Class A Stock will be deemed to include the
shares of Parent Class B Stock that are issuable as part of the Merger Consideration with regard to that Parent Class A Stock, and (iii) each
reference in this Article 1 to the Exchange Ratio will be deemed to include the shares of Parent Class B Stock that are issuable as part of the
Merger Consideration with regard to that Parent Class A Stock (except where such deemed substitution would not be practical, such as in
adjustments to the exercise price of Company Options, and in such case, with equitable and proportionate adjustments in such exercise price or
other adjustment, taking into account the Parent Class B Dividend).

1.15 Cash Election.

(a) Each person who is a record holder of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) during the period beginning on the day the
Registration Statement becomes effective, and ending on the fifth business day, before the day on which the Company Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled to be held (the “Election Period”) (provided, that if the Company Stockholder Meeting is postponed or adjourned such that there is a
new record date for the postponed or adjourned Company Stockholder Meeting, the Election Period shall end on the fifth business day before the
day on which such postponed or adjourned Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to be held), will have the option to elect (a “Cash
Election”) to receive with regard to any or all of the shares of Company Common Stock held of record by that person, in lieu of the Merger
Consideration described in Section 1.6(a), $48.26 in cash, without interest, per share of

Table of Contents

Company Common Stock (the “Cash Payment Amount”), subject to possible proration as provided in Section 1.15(c).    The option to make a
Cash Election will expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the fifth business day before the day on which the Company Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled to be held (the “Election Deadline”), whether or not the Company Stockholder Meeting is actually held on that day.

(b) At least 20 business days before the Election Deadline, Parent will cause the Distribution Agent to transmit to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock at the close of business on the day for determining the holders of record of Company Common Stock who are entitled to
vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting (or to each holder of record of Company Common Stock at the close of business on another day that is
not more than 60 days before the day on which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held) a notice of the Cash Election (which
may be the Registration Statement) and a form of election with respect to the Cash Election (the “Cash Election Form”), in each case which is
reasonably acceptable to the Company, which will enable a record holder to specify the number of shares of Company Common Stock, if any, as
to which the record holder elects to exercise the Cash Election. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Distribution Agent to
make the notice of the Cash Election and the Cash Election Form available to all persons who become record holders of shares of Company
Common Stock during the period between the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Election Deadline. In order to properly
exercise the Cash Election, a record holder of Company Common Stock must return to the Distribution Agent, and the Distribution Agent must
have received by the Election Deadline, a completed and signed Cash Election Form, together with the Certificate evidencing the shares of
Company Common Stock as to which the Cash Election is being exercised or an Agent’s Notice stating that such shares of Company Common
Stock have been transferred by book entry transfer to an account established by the Distribution Agent for the purpose of receiving Company
Common Stock. A holder of shares of Company Common Stock who submits a Cash Election Form will have the right to change or withdraw
such holder’s Cash Election at any time before the Election Deadline, but not after the Election Deadline, in accordance with procedures set forth
in the Cash Election Form. After a Cash Election is validly made and not withdrawn with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, the
holder thereof may not revoke such Cash Election after the Cash Election Deadline. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
all Cash Elections shall automatically be deemed revoked upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 6. Holders of shares of
Company Common Stock will receive the Merger Consideration described in Section 1.6(a) with regard to all the shares of Company Common
Stock as to which such holders do not validly make, or withdraw, a Cash Election, or to the extent provided in Section 1.15(c).The Distribution
Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine if any Cash Election is not properly made or withdrawn with respect to any share of Company
Common Stock (none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Distribution Agent being under any duty to notify any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock of any such defect). In the event the Distribution Agent makes such a determination, such Cash Election shall be
deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Cash Election shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless a valid Cash Election Form is thereafter timely delivered and received with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock.

(c) The aggregate amount the Surviving Corporation will pay as a result of Cash Elections will be limited to $1,162,250,000 (the
“Maximum Cash Amount”). If the total amount the Surviving Corporation would be required to pay if it paid the Cash Payment Amount with
regard to all the shares of Company Common Stock as to which valid Cash Elections are made and not withdrawn would exceed the Maximum
Cash Amount, each holder of Company Common Stock who makes a valid Cash Election that is not withdrawn will receive (i) the Cash Payment
Amount with regard to the number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the number of shares as to which the Cash Election was made
by such holder, multiplied by a fraction, of which (x) the numerator is the Maximum Cash Amount, and (y) the denominator is (A) the Cash
Payment Amount, multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock as to which valid Cash Elections are made and not
withdrawn, and (ii) the Merger Consideration with regard to the remaining shares of Company Common Stock as to which such holder of
Company Common Stock made a Cash Election. Parent and the Company, in their reasonable discretion, shall have the joint right to

make all determinations, not inconsistent with this Agreement and the DGCL, with respect to the manner and extent to which Cash Elections are
to be taken into account in making the determinations pursuant to this Section 1.15(c).

(d) Not more than two business days after the day on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will deliver to the Distribution Agent cash in
the amount equal to the Maximum Cash Amount (or such lesser amount as is necessary to enable the Distribution Agent to distribute the Cash
Payment Amount with regard to all the shares of Company Common Stock as to which the Cash Election is validly exercised and not withdrawn).
Promptly after the Distribution Agent receives cash as provided in this Section 1.15(d), the Distribution Agent will distribute the cash to the
holders of shares Company Common Stock who are entitled to receive it hereunder.

(e) The provisions of the first sentence of Section 1.16(b) and Sections 1.16(d) through (h) will apply to cash and Merger Consideration to
which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled under this Section 1.15.

1.16 Delivery of Merger Consideration.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub will designate a bank or trust company, with the Company’s prior approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to act as Distribution Agent in connection with the Merger (the “Distribution Agent”). At, or
immediately before, the Effective Time, Parent will (i) provide to the Distribution Agent, or instruct the transfer agent for the Parent Class A Stock
to deliver to the Distribution Agent upon request, the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock required to be distributed to the holders of
Company Common Stock, and (ii) cash in an amount reasonably estimated to be sufficient to enable the Distribution Agent to make all required
payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares (and additional cash at later dates to the extent it is required for payments in lieu of fractional shares),
in each case in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock. Until the Distribution Agent uses funds provided to it to pay cash
in lieu of fractional shares, the funds will be invested by the Distribution Agent, as directed by the Surviving Corporation, in short-term
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Services
Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit or banker’s acceptances issued by commercial banks, each of
which has capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating more than $500 million (based on the most recent financial statements of the banks
which are then publicly available). No such investment (or losses thereon) shall affect the amount of the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Class A Stock, or cash pursuant to Section 1.15, payable by Parent to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement. If, after
Parent has delivered shares of Parent Class A Stock to the Distribution Agent, it is reasonably determined that holders of Company Common
Stock will be entitled to fewer shares of Parent Class A Stock, less cash in lieu of fractional shares or less cash pursuant to Section 1.15, than the
number of shares or amount of cash the Distribution Agent is holding, the Distribution Agent will promptly return the excess shares or cash to
Parent. In the event that the number of shares of Parent Class A stock delivered to the Distribution Agent will not be sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration and any dividends and distributions payable under Section 1.16(b), or that the amount of cash distributed to the Distribution Agent
and held by the Distribution Agent will not be sufficient to pay for fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock or will not be sufficient to pay for all
validly made and not withdrawn Cash Elections (in any case whether because of losses on the funds invested by the Distribution Agent pursuant
to this Section 1.16(a) or otherwise), Parent shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) additional shares of Parent Class A Stock and/or additional
funds to the Distribution Agent in an amount equal to the deficiency.

(b) The Distribution Agent will be deemed to be the agent for the holders of the Company Common Stock for the purpose of receiving the
Merger Consideration, and delivery of shares of Parent Class A Stock to the Distribution Agent will be deemed to be delivery to the holders of the
Company Common Stock (except that delivery to the Distribution Agent before the Effective Time will be deemed to be delivery to

the holders of the Company Common Stock at the Effective Time). Until they are distributed, the shares of Parent Class A Stock held by the
Distribution Agent will be deemed to be outstanding from and after the Effective Time (except that excess shares returned to Parent as provided in
Section 1.16(a) will be deemed never to have been outstanding), but the Distribution Agent will not vote those shares or exercise any rights of a
stockholder with regard to them. If any dividends or distributions are paid with regard to shares of Parent Class A Stock while they are held by the
Distribution Agent, the Distribution Agent will hold the dividends or distributions, uninvested, until shares of Parent Class A Stock are distributed
to particular former holders of Company Common Stock, at which time the Distribution Agent will distribute the dividends or distributions that
have been paid with regard to those shares of Parent Class A Stock to the former holders of Company Common Stock who are entitled to receive
the shares.

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after the date on which the Effective Time occurs), the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Distribution Agent to mail to each person who was a record holder of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time, a form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of stock certificates representing Company Common Stock
(“Certificates”) in order to receive the Merger Consideration, such letter of transmittal to be in customary form and to have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree. When the Distribution Agent receives either (i) a Certificate, together with a properly
completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other documents required thereunder, or (ii) an Agent’s Notice from The Depositary Trust
Company (an “Agent’s Notice”) stating that shares of Company Common Stock have been transferred by book entry transfer into an account
established by the Distribution Agent for the purpose of receiving Company Common Stock, the Distribution Agent will promptly arrange for the
delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration (or a cash payment if required under Section 1.15) to the holder of the shares formerly
represented by the Certificate or transferred by book entry to the Distribution Agent’s account or as otherwise directed in the letter of transmittal
or the Agent’s Notice.

(d) No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration issuable upon the surrender of Certificates or book entry transfer of
shares. If Merger Consideration is to be distributed to a person other than the person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, the
surrendered Certificate must be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person who surrenders the Certificate must
provide funds for payment of any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that the tax has been paid. After the
Effective Time, a Certificate which has not been surrendered will no longer represent, and uncertificated shares reflected on the records of the
Company’s transfer agent will no longer constitute, stock of the Company, and instead will represent or constitute only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration with regard to what had been shares of Company Common Stock (and any dividends paid to holders of record after the
Effective Time with regard to the Parent Class A Stock that constitutes the Merger Consideration).

(e) If the Distribution Agent believes, or Parent notifies the Distribution Agent that it believes, that the Distribution Agent is required to
withhold any portion of the Merger Consideration (or any cash amount) payable to any person under the Code, or any provision of any state, local
or foreign tax law, the Distribution Agent will withhold Merger Consideration with a Closing Date Market Value equal to the sum the Distribution
Agent is required (or that the Distribution Agent or Parent believes the Distribution Agent is required) to withhold and Parent will provide the
Distribution Agent, in exchange for the withheld Merger Consideration, cash with which to pay the required withholding taxes to the applicable
Taxing authorities. Any Merger Consideration that constitutes a compensatory payment to the recipient may, at the direction of the Distribution
Agent, be processed through the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system. Any Merger Consideration that is withheld as permitted by this
Section 1.16(e) will be deemed to have been distributed to the person from whom it is withheld.

(f) If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation will accept, and will instruct the Distribution Agent to
accept, an affidavit and indemnification reasonably satisfactory to it instead of the Certificate.

(g) At any time which is more than six months after the Effective Time, Parent may require the Distribution Agent to return to Parent any
funds and any shares of Parent Class A Stock which have been provided to the Distribution Agent but have not been disbursed to former holders
of Company Common Stock (including, without limitation, dividends received by the Distribution Agent in respect of those shares of Parent
Class A Stock), and after the funds and shares have been returned to Parent, former stockholders of the Company must look to Parent for issuance
of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates that formerly represented, or book entry transfer of, shares of Company Common
Stock.

(h) Neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Distribution Agent will be liable to any former stockholder of the Company for any Merger
Consideration or cash payment amount which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(i) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will not record any transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock
transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and the stock ledger of the Company will be closed. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or uncertificated shares are presented for transfer, they will be cancelled and treated as having been surrendered for the Merger
Consideration (which will be paid upon receipt of a properly completed letter of transmittal or an Agent’s Notice and any other documents
required thereby).

1.17 Governance Matters. Unless otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time, Scott D. Stowell will be elected to the
Parent Board as of immediately following the Effective Time; provided, however, that if Scott D. Stowell is unable or unwilling to serve as a director on
the Parent Board immediately following the Effective Time, the Company Board may select another individual to serve on the Parent’s Board as of
immediately following the Effective Time, such person to be reasonably acceptable to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Parent’s
Board.

ARTICLE 2

CLOSING DATE AND EFFECTIVE TIME OF MERGER

2.1 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the day (the “Closing Date”) that is the first

day on which all the conditions in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, other than conditions which are expected to be fulfilled on the Closing Date, have been fulfilled
or waived (to the extent permitted by law, and subject to such fulfillment or waiver at the Closing). The Closing will take place by an electronic
exchange of documents (unless either the Company or Parent requests a physical Closing, in which case the Closing will take place at the offices of
Goodwin Procter, LLP, 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY or another place agreed to by the Company and Parent). The Closing Date and the time and
place of the Closing (if there is a physical Closing) may be changed with the written consent of the Company and Parent.

and all the documents required to be delivered at the Closing are delivered as contemplated by this Agreement, on the Closing Date Merger Sub will
cause the Certificate of Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware.

2.3 Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger will become effective at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the day on which the Certificate of Merger is

ARTICLE 3

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

3.1 Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as disclosed or reflected in (a) documents filed by the Company with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) at least two business days before the date of this Agreement (other than disclosures regarding future risks made
under the caption “Risk Factors” or disclosures constituting forward looking statements that were the subject of disclaimers) or (b) a section of the
disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent in connection with the execution of this Agreement (the “Company Disclosure Letter”) (it being
understood that the disclosure of any information in a particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

(b) The Company has all corporate power and authority necessary to enable it to enter into this Agreement and carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. All corporate actions necessary to authorize the
Company to enter into this Agreement and carry out the transactions contemplated by it, other than obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
and the filing of appropriate Merger documentation as required by the DGCL, have been taken. This Agreement has been duly executed by the
Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as
enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.

(c) Without limiting what is said in Section 3.1(b), the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Company Board”) has unanimously
(i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
(ii) adopted this Agreement and approved the transactions contemplated by it, including the Merger, and declared that this Agreement and the
Merger are advisable, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Company’s stockholders vote all the shares of Company Common Stock they own,
or as to which they for any other reason have voting power, in favor of adopting this Agreement and approving the Merger; provided, that such
recommendation was made subject to the understanding that the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if one
is permitted by Section 4.8 hereof. The determinations and recommendations of the Company Board described in the first sentence of this
Section 3.1(c) were made after the Company Board received and considered an opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan”), as
financial adviser to the Company, to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions
set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to the Company’s stockholders.

(d) Assuming that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the consents described in Section 3.1(e) and in Section 3.1-D of the
Company Disclosure Letter are obtained, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or of any document to be
delivered by the Company in accordance with this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by
any document to be delivered in accordance with this Agreement will violate, result in a breach of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company, any agreement or
instrument to which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which any of them is bound, any law, or any order, rule or
regulation of any court or other governmental agency or any other regulatory or quasi-regulatory organization having jurisdiction over the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, except violations, breaches or defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect upon the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term “Material Adverse Effect”
upon a company means a material adverse effect upon (i) the consolidated financial position, results of operations, assets, business or operations
of the applicable company and its

subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the applicable company to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without material delay or impairment; provided, however, that the following shall not constitute, either alone or in combination, a
“Material Adverse Effect” or be taken into account when determining whether a “Material Adverse Effect” has occurred or would reasonably be
expected to occur: (A) changes in the economy or financial, credit or capital markets of the United States of America (the “United States”) in
general, including changes in interest rates and availability and cost of borrowings or other costs of financing, (B) changes generally affecting the
industry or industries in which that company or its subsidiaries conduct their businesses, (C) changes in applicable law, (D) changes in generally
accepted accounting principles or interpretations of them, (E) changes in global or national political conditions (including the outbreak or
escalation of war or acts of terrorism) or any natural disaster, (F) changes attributable to the execution, public disclosure or performance of this
Agreement or the announcement, pendency or consummation of the transactions contemplated by it, including the institution of litigation relating
to or arising from the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, and the impact of the execution, disclosure or performance of this
Agreement on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with suppliers, customers, employees, Governmental Authorities, business partners or
similar relationships, (G) the performance by the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries of its obligations under this Agreement, (H) any
action taken with the written consent of the other party or that is required by the terms of this Agreement, (I) any failure to meet any internal or
third party estimates, projections or forecasts of revenue, earnings or other financial performance (but not the facts or circumstances underlying or
giving rise to such failure), (J) with respect to the Company, (x) any items set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, or (y) any change, in and of
itself, in the trading price or trading volume of Company Common Stock on the NYSE, or (K) with respect to Parent, (x) any items set forth in the
Parent Disclosure Letter or (y) any change, in and of itself, in the trading price of either class of Parent Stock on the NYSE; except to the extent
that the effect of a change described in one or more of clauses (A) through (E) materially disproportionately adversely affects the applicable
company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies engaged in similar businesses, and then only to the extent of such
disproportionality.

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.1-E of the Company Disclosure Letter, no governmental filings, authorizations, approvals, or consents, or
other governmental action, other than (i) the termination or expiration of waiting periods under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), if any, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
(iii) the filing with the SEC of the Joint Proxy Statement and any reports relating to the Merger required to be filed under the Exchange Act and
the rules under it or and any other applicable state or federal securities, takeover and “blue sky” laws, and (iv) such other filings, authorizations,
approvals consents or other action, the failure of which to be obtained or made, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect upon the Company, are required to permit the Company to fulfill all its obligations
under this Agreement.

(f) The Company and each of its subsidiaries is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in each state in which it is required to be
qualified, except states in which the failure to qualify, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(g) The only authorized stock of the Company is 600,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.01 per share. At the close of business on October 23, 2017 (the “Measurement Time”), the only outstanding stock of the Company
was not more than 111,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock. All those shares have been duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and

4.4 Parent Stockholders Meeting. Parent will take all action that is necessary in accordance with applicable law and its Certificate of Incorporation
and bylaws to convene a special meeting of its stockholders (the “Parent Stockholders Meeting” and together with the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the “Stockholders Meetings”) as soon as practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective for the purpose of obtaining the
Parent Stockholder Approval (and shall, subject to the other provisions herein relating to the timing of such meeting, use its reasonable best efforts to
convene the Parent Stockholders Meeting within 45 days after the Registration Statement becomes effective). Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent may, without the consent of the Company, adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting for up to 30 days (or
for such longer period as is required by law) (i) if as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the

expected to be a violation of applicable law, (iii) for the distribution of any legally required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement, or

Approval. The proxy statement distributed by Parent with respect to the Parent Stockholders Meeting will be the Joint Proxy Statement and will include
the recommendation of Parent’s Board of Directors that its stockholders vote to authorize and approve the Parent Stockholder Matters (the “Parent
Recommendation”), unless Parent effects a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 4.9. Subject to the preceding sentence, Parent
will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies or votes sufficient to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent shall file
a Certificate of Amendment relating to the Parent Certificate Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware promptly after receipt of
the Parent Stockholder Approval.

4.5 Registration Statement/Proxy Statement.

(a) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company will prepare a joint proxy statement for use in
connection with each of the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the “Joint Proxy Statement”). Parent will prepare and file with the SEC as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement (and in any event within 10 days after (A) the pro forma financial information that is required to be included in the Registration
Statement is approved by Parent’s and the Company’s respective auditors for inclusion in the Registration Statement, and (B) Parent receives all
information to be provided by the Company for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement), a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the shares
of Parent Stock to be issued as a result of the Merger (such registration statement, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
“Registration Statement”). The Registration Statement will include the Joint Proxy Statement. Parent and the Company will cooperate to provide
all information which is required to be included in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement in a timely manner so the Registration
Statement can be filed with the SEC as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event within 10 days after the pro forma
financial information that is required to be included in the Registration Statement is approved by Parent’s and the Company’s respective auditors
for inclusion in the Registration Statement). Parent will cause the portions of the Registration Statement other than the Joint Proxy Statement, and
Parent and the Company will cause the Joint Proxy Statement, to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and forms under them. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts, and the Company will
cooperate with Parent, to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective as promptly as practicable after it is filed (including without
limitation, promptly responding to any comments from the SEC staff with respect to the Registration Statement) and to keep it effective as long as

each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the staff of the SEC and of any requests by the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for additional information and each party will promptly supply the other
party with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) all
orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement; provided that no response to any oral or written request by the staff of the SEC with
respect to the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without providing the
other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (and good faith consideration by Parent or the Company, as applicable, of all
such comments).

(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing
of, or amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by the Company or Parent, without providing the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (and good faith consideration by Parent or the Company, as applicable, of all such
comments); provided, however, that the Company may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement without the review or comment of Parent
in the event of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and Parent may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement without review or
comment by the Company in the event of a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. If at any time after the Registration Statement becomes
effective and prior to the Closing, an event occurs with respect to Parent and its subsidiaries or with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries
that Parent or the Company reasonably determines is required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that
either such document would include in all material respects all the information required to be included in it and would at the time of the
Stockholders Meetings not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that determines such information is required will promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement containing such information will be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law or requested by the staff of the SEC, Parent and the Company will each distribute the amendment or supplement to the
Joint Proxy Statement to the holders of its common stock as promptly as practicable. Except as set forth in this Section 4.5(b), neither Parent nor
the Company will make any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or to the Joint Proxy Statement without the approval of the
other of them, which approval will not be withheld or delayed unless the party withholding the approval reasonably determines that the
amendment or supplement would be inaccurate or misleading in a material respect or would violate this Agreement.

(c) Parent will notify the Company promptly after it receives notice that the Registration Statement has become effective or that a stop order
has been issued with regard to the Registration Statement.

(d) The Company will not take any action, other than terminating this Agreement if it is entitled to do so under Article 6, which prevents the
holders of the Company Common Stock from voting on a proposal to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to Section 4.8; provided that such Company Adverse Recommendation Change will not be a basis for the Company to cancel the
Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise attempt to prevent the holders of the Company Common Stock from having an opportunity to vote
on a proposal to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger, unless such Company Adverse Recommendation Change results in termination of
this Agreement under Article 6.

(e) Parent will not take any action, other than terminating this Agreement if it is entitled to do so under Article 6, which prevents the holders
of the Parent Stock from voting on the Parent Stockholder Matters. Without limiting what is said in the preceding sentence, a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change will not be a basis for Parent to cancel the Parent Stockholders Meeting or otherwise attempt to prevent the holders of
Parent Stock from having an opportunity to vote on the Parent Stockholder Matters.

4.6 HSR Act Filings. The Company and Parent will each make as promptly as practicable the filing, if any, it is required to make under the HSR
Act with regard to the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement and each of them will take all reasonable steps within its control (including
providing information to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice) to cause any waiting periods required by the HSR Act to be
terminated or to expire as promptly as practicable. If a filing under the HSR Act is required, the Company and Parent will each provide information and
cooperate in all other respects to assist the other of them in making its filing under the HSR Act.

4.7 No Solicitation of Offers; Notice of Proposals from Others.

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 4.7 and Section 4.8, (i) the Company will terminate all ongoing discussions regarding Company
Acquisition Proposals or otherwise regarding possible Company Acquisition Transactions, and (ii) except as provided in Section 4.7(b), the Company
will not, and will not authorize or approve and will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent, any of its or its subsidiaries’ officers, directors, employees,
agents or representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant acting on its behalf), directly or indirectly to initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate (by making available non-public information or otherwise) any inquiry or the making of any
proposal or offer with respect to (A) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company, or (B) any
purchase of or tender or exchange offer for all or any significant portion of the Company’s equity securities, or (C) any purchase of all or, except in the
ordinary course of business, a significant portion of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (each of these being a
“Company Acquisition Transaction,” and a proposal to enter into a Company Acquisition Transaction, whether made to the Company or its
stockholders, being a “Company Acquisition Proposal”); provided, however, nothing contained herein shall prohibit an interaction with a Potential
Acquiror solely to clarify the terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal the Potential Acquiror has made.

(b) Section 4.7(a) will not prevent the Company from, in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal which the Company receives despite
complying with Section 4.7(a) in all material respects, and which the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent
financial advisor, constitutes or would be reasonably expected to result in, a transaction which would be more favorable to the Company’s stockholders
than the Merger, furnishing non-public information (after receipt of an Appropriate Confidentiality Agreement) to the person, entity or group (the
“Potential Acquiror”) which makes the Company Acquisition Proposal and entering into discussions and negotiations with that Potential Acquiror.

(c) If at any time, the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal or a request for non-public information in connection with a
Company Acquisition Proposal, or an indication that a Potential Acquiror intends to make a Company Acquisition Proposal, as promptly as practicable,
and in any event within two business days after the Company receives the Company Acquisition Proposal, request for non-public information or
indication of intent to make a Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company will inform Parent about such Company Acquisition Proposal, request or
indication, including the identity of the Potential Acquiror from which the Company Acquisition Proposal, request or indication was received, and a
reasonably detailed description of its material terms, and the Company will promptly, from time to time, provide Parent with any additional information
the Company obtains regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal, request or notification from the Potential Acquiror, and otherwise keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status of such possible Company Acquisition Proposal.

(a) Subject to the permitted actions contemplated by Section 6.1(f)(iv), neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(1)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub or to the Merger, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub or the Merger, the Company Recommendation, or (2) publicly propose to approve or recommend any Company Acquisition

(ii) authorize the Company to enter into a binding agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal prior to the termination of this Agreement
(an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.8, if, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s
exercise of its fiduciary duties, the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or
a Company Intervening Event, or (B) authorize the entry into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, and cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1(f)(iv) and concurrently enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company may not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(f)(iv) unless:

(i) the Company gives Parent written notice of its intention to give a Company Adverse Recommendation Change because of a
Company Intervening Event at least five business days before effecting the Company Adverse Recommendation Change or gives Parent a
Superior Proposal Notice in accordance with Section 6.1(f)(iv);

(ii) if the proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change is because of a Company Intervening Event, and, if Parent asks the
Company to do so, the Company engages in good faith discussions with Parent during the five business day period about possible changes
to the terms of this Agreement that would cause the Company Board not to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and

(iii) if the proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in order to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(f)(iv),
(A) if Parent asks the Company to do so, the Company shall engage in good faith discussions with Parent during the three NYSE trading
day period set forth in Section 6.1(f)(iv) (or such shorter period provided by Section 6.1(f)(v)) about possible changes to the terms of this
Agreement that would cause the Company Board to determine that the Superior Proposal that is the subject of the notice under
Section 6.1(f)(iv) is no longer a Superior Proposal, and (B) Parent fails to give the Company a Consideration Increase Notice by the time
provided in Section 6.1(f)(iv) and (v), or if such notice is delivered, the Company Board in good faith determines after consultation with its

4.9 Parent Board Recommendation.

(a) Subject to the permitted actions contemplated by Section 4.9(b), neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to the Company or the Merger, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company or the
Merger, the Parent Recommendation (any of such actions, a “Parent Adverse Recommendation Change”).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.9, if, prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Parent Board’s exercise of
its fiduciary duties, the Parent Board may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change because of a Parent Intervening Event; provided, however,
that the Parent Board may not make a Parent Adverse Recommendation unless Parent gives the Company written notice at least five business days
before effecting the Company Adverse Recommendation Change and, if the Company requests that it do so, Parent engages in good faith discussions
with the Company during the five business day period about possible changes to the terms of this Agreement that would cause the Parent Board not to
make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

(c) As used in this Agreement, a “Parent Intervening Event” means an event or circumstance that was not known to, or reasonably
foreseeable by, the Parent Board prior to the execution of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable), of which the Parent Board becomes aware before the Parent Stockholder Approval, which event or circumstance or its consequences
materially increases the value of Parent and its subsidiaries, and that does not relate to (A) the Company or its subsidiaries (including any Material
Adverse Effect as it relates to the Company), (B) any actions taken pursuant to this Agreement, (C) any changes in the price of Company Common
Stock or Parent Stock (but not the facts or circumstances underlying or giving rise to such changes in the price of Parent Stock), (D) changes in
applicable law, (E) changes in GAAP or other applicable accounting rules, (F) changes generally affecting an industry or industries in which the
Company or Parent or their respective subsidiaries conduct business, (G) changes in global or national political conditions (including the outbreak or
escalation of war or acts of terrorism), or (H) changes in economic conditions in the United States or regions in which the Company or Parent or their
subsidiaries do business.

4.10 Company’s Cooperation with Regard to Financing. The Company will, and will cause its and its subsidiaries’ officers and employees to,
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the efforts of Parent to arrange any financing that it expects to use in connection with the Merger or after the
Effective Time, provided that the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to carry out the Merger are not conditioned on any such financing being
arranged.

4.11 Return of Materials Subject to Confidentiality Agreements. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, to the extent
permitted by applicable confidentiality agreements, the Company will request that any person (other than Parent) that holds confidential materials
provided by or on behalf of the Company during the two years prior to the date of this Agreement under a confidentiality agreement entered into in
connection with a possible Company Acquisition Transaction promptly return such materials or destroy such confidential material.

4.12 Communications to Company Employees. The Company shall provide Parent reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the form of
any written statements to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries informing them about the Merger prior to any distribution of such statements.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4.12 does not apply to matters contemplated by Section 9.3.

4.13 Defense Against Litigation. If litigation is instituted against any of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates
seeking to prevent the Merger or to obtain damages if the Merger takes place, (i) whichever of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub is a defendant in the
litigation will promptly notify the other

(or others) of them of the commencement of the litigation and will keep the other (or others) of them informed of all material developments in the
litigation or efforts to resolve it, and (ii) each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, whether or not it is a defendant in the litigation, will, at its own
cost, cooperate in all reasonable ways with the efforts by the other or others of them to cause the litigation to be dismissed or otherwise resolved on a
basis that does not interfere with the ability of the Merger to timely take place when and as contemplated by this Agreement or result in an award of
damages against any of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective affiliates. The Company will not settle any such litigation on a
basis that requires the payment of money (including payment of fees or other sums to the plaintiffs’ counsel) without Parent’s consent, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

4.14 Efforts of Parent and Merger Sub to Fulfill Conditions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section 4.9), Parent
and Merger Sub each will use its reasonable best efforts to cause all the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 to be fulfilled as promptly as practicable and
to consummate the Merger.

consummate the Merger.

ARTICLE 6

TERMINATION

6.1 Right to Terminate. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time (whether or not the Company’s stockholders,
Parent’s stockholders or both of them have given the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval):

(a) By written mutual written consent of the Company and Parent.

(b) By either the Company or Parent if the Closing Date does not occur on or before May 31, 2018 (the “Outside Date”); provided,
however, that if the Closing Date does not occur by the third business day before the Outside Date because the condition set forth in Section 5.1(c)
or Section 5.2(c) has not have been satisfied or waived, either the Company or Parent may, by a notice given to the other of them by the third
business day prior to May 31, 2018, extend the Outside Date by up to an additional three months to a date not later than August 31, 2018, which
date shall thereafter be considered the Outside Date; provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 6.1(b) shall
not be available to any party whose breach of a provision of this Agreement has been a material cause of, or a material factor that resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur prior to the Outside Date.

(c) By either the Company or Parent if (i) any applicable law is in effect that would make the Merger unlawful, or (ii) any order of any court
or other Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction is entered permanently enjoining the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from
consummating the Merger and such order has become final and non-appealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement was a material cause of, or a
material factor that resulted in, the imposition of any such order or the failure of such order to be resisted, resolved or lifted, as applicable.

(d) By either the Company or Parent if the Company Stockholders Meeting is held, but at the Company Stockholders Meeting or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the Company’s stockholders do not give the Company Stockholder Approval.

(e) By either the Company or Parent if the Parent Stockholders Meeting is held, but at the Parent Stockholders Meeting or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof, Parent’s stockholders do not give the Parent Stockholder Approval.

(f) By the Company if:

(i) There exists a breach or failure to perform of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.1 if
occurring or continuing at the Effective Time, and (B) is incapable of being cured, or if capable of being cured, is not cured by the earlier of
(1) one business day prior to the Outside Date, and (2) 30 days after Parent receives written notice of such breach from the Company (which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such breach and the Company’s intention to terminate this Agreement if such breach is
not cured); provided that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.1(f)(i) at a time when

(iii) Prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board effects a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

(iv) The Company has complied in all material respects with Section 4.7, and despite that, before the Company’s stockholders have
given the Company Stockholder Approval,

(A) the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal, including a Potential Acquiror commencing a cash tender offer or
an exchange offer for all or a majority of the outstanding Company Common Stock (other than any Company Common Stock
already owned by the Potential Acquiror), that the Company Board determines in good faith to be a Superior Proposal;

(B) the Company gives Parent a notice (a “Superior Proposal Notice”) (x) describing the terms of the Superior Proposal
(including the consideration per share of Company Common Stock the Company’s stockholders would receive as a result of the
Superior Proposal), and (y) stating that unless Parent agrees to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
Company Acquisition Proposal that had been determined to be a Superior Proposal is no longer a Superior Proposal, the Company
intends to terminate this Agreement in order to enter into the transaction that is the subject of the Superior Proposal;

(C) either (x) Parent does not, by 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the third NYSE trading day after the day on which the Superior
Proposal Notice is given, give the Company a notice (a “Consideration Increase Notice”) that Parent will amend the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as set forth in such Consideration Increase Notice, or (y) if a Consideration Increase Notice is
provided, the Company Board in good faith determines after consultation with its financial advisor and consideration of the changes
proposed by Parent in the Consideration Increase Notice, that the Company Acquisition Proposal it had determined to be a Superior
Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal; and

(D) the Company provides written notice of termination of this Agreement and pays Parent the Company Termination Fee
(defined below).

(v) For the purposes of Section 6.1(f)(iv):

(A) A “Superior Proposal” is a Company Acquisition Proposal, which (v) is not subject to the outcome of due diligence or
any other form of investigation, (w) is not subject to a financing contingency, (x) is from a Potential Acquiror which the Company
Board reasonably determines in good faith after consultation with its independent financial advisor has the financial resources
necessary to carry out the transaction, (y) is not reasonably likely to be the subject of regulatory concerns that could prevent or
materially delay completion of the transaction that is the subject of the Acquisition Proposal or acceptance of Company Common
Stock that is tendered in response to the tender or exchange offer, and (z) the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its independent financial advisor, and taking account of, among other things, the value to the holders of Company
Common Stock of the ability, if the Merger takes place, to participate in the synergy benefits resulting from the Merger, to be more
favorable to the holders of the Company Common Stock than the Merger.

(B) If the Company delivers a Superior Proposal Notice or the notice described in Section 4.8(b)(i) before the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the delivery of the Superior Proposal Notice or such other notice will automatically postpone the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting (and, if it has not already taken place, the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting) until the third
NYSE trading day after the last day of the period during which Parent can deliver a Consideration Increase Notice, or the Company
is required to enter into discussions regarding the Company Intervening Event under Section 4.8(b)(ii), unless the Company and
Parent agree that it should be held on an earlier date. When the Company delivers a Superior Proposal Notice, (i) the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub under Article 1 and Sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 and 4.14 will be suspended and (ii) the obligations of the Company
under Sections 4.3, 4.5, 4.6 and 4.15 will be suspended, in each case, until the date the Company withdraws such Superior Proposal
Notice.

(C) If, after Parent has given a Consideration Increase Notice, the Potential Acquiror modifies its Company Acquisition
Proposal so the Company Board determines the modified Company Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the Company will
be required on up to two further occasions to deliver a new Superior Proposal Notice, and the provisions of Section 6.1(f)(iv) and
this Section 6.1(f)(v) will apply to the modified Company Acquisition Proposal in the same manner they applied to the original
Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board had previously determined to be a Superior Proposal, except that the period
in which Parent can deliver a Consideration Increase Notice and the period in which the Company is required to negotiate with
Parent need not be later than one NYSE trading day after the day on which the related Superior Proposal Notice is given.

(g) By Parent if:

(i) There exists a breach or failure to perform of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 5.1 if occurring or
continuing at the Effective Time, and (B) is incapable of being cured, or if capable of being cured, is not cured by the earlier of (1) one
business day prior to the Outside Date, and (2) 30 days after the Company receives written notice of such breach from Parent (which notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such breach and Parent’s intention to terminate this Agreement if such breach is not cured);
provided that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.1(g)(i) at a time when Parent or Merger
Sub is in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that would result in a failure of any condition set forth in
Section 5.1(b).

(ii) All of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 have been satisfied or waived, but the Company has failed to consummate the Merger
by the time the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.1, which failure is a breach of the Company’s obligations under this
Agreement.

(iii) Prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board effects a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change.

(iv) Prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (x) the Company fails to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of the
Merger within ten business days after the date a Company Acquisition Proposal or any material modification thereto is first publicly
announced, following a written request by Parent to make such public affirmation (which Parent may only request one time with respect to
each such proposal or modification), or (y) any person other than Parent or its affiliates commences a tender offer or exchange offer for 50%
or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock and either (A) the Company Board or a committee of the Company Board
recommends that the Company’s stockholders tender all or a portion of their Company Common Stock in response to the tender offer or
exchange offer, or (B) the Company does not within ten business days after the tender or exchange offer is commenced file with the SEC a
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 which contains a recommendation of the Company Board that the Company’s stockholders not tender their
Company Common Stock in response to the tender or exchange offer.

6.2 Manner of Terminating Agreement. If at any time the Company or Parent has the right under Section 6.1 to terminate this Agreement, except
as specifically provided in Section 6.1, such party may terminate this Agreement by a notice to the other party that it is terminating this Agreement,
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and describing the basis therefor in reasonable detail; provided that no such
notice shall be required for a termination under Section 6.1(a).

6.3 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1 or Section 6.2, following such termination, this Agreement shall
immediately become null, void and have no further effect and no party will have any further rights or obligations hereunder; provided that the provisions
of this Article 6, Article 7 and Article 9 (other than Section 9.3), and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in

OTHER AGREEMENTS

8.1 Indemnification for Prior Acts.

(a) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) honor, and not to amend or modify, and to indemnify and hold harmless and advance
costs and expenses pursuant to, and to the same extent as, any obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries under any agreement or arrangement
(including any provision of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws or the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws and similar
organizational documents of any of the Company’s subsidiaries) in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify persons who at the Effective
Time are current or former directors, officers, agents or employees of the Company or its subsidiaries (each an “Indemnified Party”) with respect
to matters which occur at or prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) cause the Certificate of Incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advances of expenses of Indemnified Parties
for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws of the Company as of the date of
this Agreement. Parent hereby guaranties the indemnification and expense advancement obligations of the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries under such agreements and arrangements. Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect for not less than
six years after the Effective Time, with respect to occurrences on or prior to the Effective Time, the Company’s policies of directors’ and officers’
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”) which are in effect on the date of this Agreement and are listed on
Schedule 8.1 (notwithstanding any provisions of those policies that they will terminate as a result of the Merger), or substantially similar
insurance, which in each case will cover each person covered by the Company’s current D&O Insurance, to the extent that insurance is available
at an annual cost not exceeding 200% of the annual cost of the D&O Insurance that is in effect at the date of this Agreement, and to the extent that
insurance is not available at an annual cost that will not exceed such amount, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in
effect for that period the maximum amount of such insurance coverage that can be obtained for such maximum annual cost. The insurance
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 8.1 will provide and contain benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage that are substantially equivalent to, and in any event no less favorable to the insureds, than that provided in the Company’s
existing D&O Insurance as of the date of this Agreement.

(b) The provisions of this Section 8.1 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives. The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder will be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such
Indemnified Party may have under the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, or similar organizational documents of the Company’s
subsidiaries, the Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, the DGCL or otherwise. From and after the Effective
Time, the provisions of this Section 8.1 may not be terminated or amended in any manner adverse to any Indemnified Party without such
Indemnified Party’s prior written consent.

any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, set forth in this Section 8.1.

8.2 Company Employee Matters.

(a) For a period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on November 30, 2018, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or its subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or a subsidiary of either of them (each a “Continuing Employee”) either, at Parent’s election, (x) compensation (including, without
limitation, base salary or wage rate, bonus or commission opportunity, cash incentive compensation opportunity and if the Continuing Employee
received equity compensation from the Company, equity-based compensation opportunity) that is not less favorable in aggregate to the Continuing
Employee than the compensation the Continuing Employee was receiving as an employee of the Company immediately before the Effective Time
or (y) the same compensation as that provided by Parent and its subsidiaries to their similarly-situated employees (taking account of duties,
geographical location and any other relevant factors) during such period.

(b) Parent will provide each Continuing Employee with credit for all service with the Company or its subsidiaries (including for purposes of
this Section 8.2, any predecessor companies) as if such service were with Parent and its subsidiaries for purposes of determining eligibility,
vesting, levels of benefits and benefit accrual under the employee benefit and compensation plans in which such Continuing Employee
participates after the Effective Time to the same extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or its subsidiaries.
Unused vacation days accrued by Continuing Employees under the plans and policies of the Company and its subsidiaries shall carry over to
Parent. This Section 8.2(b) shall not operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any Continuing Employee or require Parent to continue in effect
any specific plan of the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) or any Parent employee benefit plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, and without limiting the generality of Sections 8.2(a) and (b), with respect to any health plan (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, includes medical, dental, vision and prescription drug) of Parent or its subsidiaries in which such Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate, for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate in the plan Parent shall, or
shall cause its applicable subsidiary to, cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Parent or subsidiary
plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company
plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, any Continuing Employees who participated in 401(k), health and welfare plans (which, for
avoidance of doubt, include medical, dental, vision, prescription drug, life insurance, AD&D, disability insurance and flex spending), will be
given the opportunity to participate in the most nearly comparable plans maintained by Parent through the end of the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs.

(e) Parent shall honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each change in control agreement and severance agreement that is in effect as of the
date hereof between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and current or former employees or directors of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, and (ii) the parameters related to severance set forth on Section 8.2-E of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(f) With regard to the annual cash bonuses relating to calendar year 2017: (i) if the Effective Time occurs after February 28, 2018, the
Company will pay such bonuses no later than February 28, 2018, and (ii) if the Effective Time occurs on or before February 28, 2018, the
Company will pay such bonuses

Company Disclosure Letter.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other subsidiary of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to terminate the employment of any Continuing
Employee at any time, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or any subsidiary of any of them and the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other applicable
plan or program of Parent covering such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 8.2 shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan,
or (ii) create any third party rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or its subsidiaries (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof).

(h) Except to the extent expressly set forth in Sections 8.2(d) and (e), nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to
establish any compensation policy, or to amend or modify any existing benefit plan, program, agreement, policy or arrangement established,
sponsored or maintained by Parent or a subsidiary, or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement, policy or arrangement at any time.

(i) Except to the extent expressly set forth in Section 8.2(d), this Section 8.2 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of
the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 8.2, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever.

ARTICLE 9

GENERAL

9.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will each pay its own fees, costs
and expenses in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including legal fees and
disbursements, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

9.2 Access to Properties, Books and Records. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the time this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Article 6, the Company will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, upon reasonable notice, give Representatives of
Parent and Merger Sub (at Parent’s sole cost and expense), or of any potential sources of financing to Parent or Merger Sub for financing to be used in
connection with the Merger or after the Merger, reasonable access during normal business hours to all of their respective properties, books and records
and to personnel who are knowledgeable about the various aspects of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company will not be required by this Section 9.2 to, or be required to cause any of its subsidiaries to, permit any inspection, provide any access, or
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would be reasonably likely to (a) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or
other privilege held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (b) violate any applicable laws (and the Company shall be permitted to implement
customary “clean-room” or other similar arrangements if the Company reasonably determines, upon advice of outside counsel, that such arrangements
are necessary to comply with applicable law), (c) unreasonably disrupt the businesses and operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
(d) breach any agreement of the Company or any of its subsidiaries with any third party, or (e) otherwise result in the disclosure of trade secrets of a
third party or violate its or its subsidiaries’ respective obligations to a third party with respect to confidentiality, provided that the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the third parties to the inspection or disclosure. Until the Effective Time, Parent and Merger
Sub each will, and will cause its

subsidiaries in confidence on the terms provided in the confidentiality agreement dated as of October 2, 2017, between the Company and Parent (the
“Confidentiality Agreement”), and until the Effective Time, the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to that information to the same extent it applies
to information provided by the Company before this Agreement was executed. If this Agreement is terminated before the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub will have the same obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement with regard to handling and disposition of confidential information
received after the date of this Agreement that they have with regard to confidential information received before the date of this Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

9.3 Publicity and Notification.

until (i) with respect to the Company, the Company Board effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) with respect to Parent,
the Parent Board effects a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company and Parent will consult with each other before (x) issuing any
press releases or otherwise making any public statements or announcements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or (y) making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Authority with respect thereto, provided
that nothing in this Section 9.3(a) will prevent any party or any affiliate of any party (A) from making any statement or announcement when and
as required by applicable law or by the rules of any securities exchange (including the NYSE) or securities quotation or trading system on which
securities of that party or an affiliate are listed, quoted or traded, or (B) from making any press release or public statement without such
consultation that is consistent with any press release or public statement as to which the parties previously agreed.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will promptly notify the other after receiving or becoming aware of any notice or other communication
from any person alleging that the consent of such person (or another person) is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

9.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the schedules and exhibits hereto (which are incorporated herein by this reference), the documents to be
delivered in accordance with this Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, and the Confidentiality
Agreement (collectively, the “Transaction Documents”), contain the entire agreement among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub relating to the
transactions which are the subject of this Agreement, and all other documents, all prior negotiations, understandings and agreements (oral and written)
between the Company and either Parent or Merger Sub with respect to those matters are superseded by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, and each party acknowledges and agrees that it has not relied upon any statements, representations, warranties, understandings or
agreements concerning or relating to the other party, or to the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents,
other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

9.5 Benefit of Agreement.

(a) This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to it, their respective successors and any permitted assigns. Each party hereto agrees

parties hereto, except, if the Merger takes place (i) as provided in Sections 8.1 and 8.2(d), and (ii) the rights of stockholders of the Company and
holders of options, warrants (if any), restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights to receive the Merger Consideration or other consideration

express rights granted to each such person in this Agreement. Except as set forth in this subsection (a), this Agreement is not intended to be for the
benefit of, or to give any rights to, any person other than the parties hereto.

(b) The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters rather than assurances of existence of facts or conditions. Consequently, no persons other than the parties to this Agreement may
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date or for any other purpose.

9.6 Effect of Disclosures. Any information disclosed by a party in connection with any representation and warranty contained in this Agreement
(including any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement) will be treated as having been disclosed in connection with each representation and warranty made
by that party in this Agreement. The parties are aware that a party may include in Sections of its Disclosure Letter items as to which it is not certain
whether they are required to be included in those Sections of the Disclosure Letter. The fact that an item is included in a Section of a Disclosure Letter
that requires disclosures of items above a specified level of materiality does not constitute an acknowledgment that the item is above that level of
materiality, and the fact that an item is included in a Section of a Disclosure Letter that requires disclosures of violations of particular types of legal or
governmental requirements does not constitute an acknowledgment that the item in fact violates the applicable legal or governmental requirements.

9.7 Captions and Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a section, article, exhibit or schedule such reference shall be to a
section, article, exhibit or schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and the captions and headings of the Articles and
Sections of this Agreement or in any exhibit or schedule are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or

circumstances require. Any capitalized terms used in any exhibit or schedule but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning as defined in this

specified. The words “hereof,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall, unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision in this Agreement. The term “or” is not exclusive. The word
“shall” shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word “will.” References to days mean calendar days unless otherwise specified.

9.8 Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

(a) “affiliate” means for any person, any other person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled
by, or is under common control with, the first-mentioned person, where “control” (including the terms “controlled by” and “under common

courts in the State of Delaware, other than proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any
such Delaware court, (ii) submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of each of such courts in any such proceeding, (iii) agrees not to seek, and to
waive as a defense in any such proceeding, the transfer of any such proceeding to any other court, whether because of inconvenience of the forum or for
any other reason, and (iv) agrees that process in any such proceeding may be served by registered mail or in any other manner permitted by the rules of
the court in which the proceeding is brought.

9.13 Remedies; Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge that money damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy if the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub failed to perform in any material respect

any of its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and accordingly they agree that, in addition to any other remedy to which a
party may be entitled at law or in equity, any party will be entitled to obtain an order granting an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or compelling specific performance of another party’s obligations under this Agreement, without proof of actual damages and without any
requirement that it post a bond, and the parties agree that if any proceeding is brought in equity to compel performance of any provision of this
Agreement, no party will raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no remedy will be
exclusive of any other remedy to which a party may be entitled, and the remedies available to a party will be cumulative.

9.14 Attorney Conflicts and Attorney Client Privilege. Parent, the Company and Merger Sub each agrees that, although Gibson Dunn & Crutcher
LLP (“Gibson Dunn”) has rendered, and may continue to render, legal services to the Company prior to the Effective Time, including legal services
relating to this Agreement and the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, Gibson Dunn will have the right, after the Effective Time, to
render legal services to any stockholder, director or employee of the Company, including with regard to any disputes relating to this Agreement or the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, and Parent, the Company and Merger Sub each waives any right it might have to seek to disqualify
Gibson Dunn from rendering legal services to any stockholder, director or employee of the Company on the basis of any conflict of interest, because of
information of which Gibson Dunn may have become aware while rendering legal services to the Company, or for any other reason.

9.15 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER
OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY
WAY OF COUNTERCLAIM AND ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THE NEGOTIATION, PERFORMANCE OR
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT IS AWARE THAT THIS
WAIVER OF RIGHTS TO JURY TRIAL WAS A FACTOR IN THE OTHER PARTY’S OR PARTIES’ DECISION TO AGREE TO THE TERMS OF
THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT NO PERSON PROMISED THAT THIS WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WOULD NOT BE
ENFORCED.

9.16 Amendments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, by an instrument signed by the Company and Parent. This Agreement may not be amended or modified after the Effective Time.

9.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which may be signed by fewer than all the parties or
may contain facsimile copies of pages signed by some of the parties. This Agreement shall become effective when at least one counterpart has been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. Each of those counterparts will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement, but
all of them together will constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
or other electronic transmission, including by .PDF e-mail attachment, shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

9.18 Tax Matters. The parties to this Agreement intend that (i) the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, (ii) each of Parent and the Company will be a “party to a reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under it, and (iii) this Agreement will constitute a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.368-2(g). Each party will do all things that are commercially reasonable to cause the Merger to qualify for that treatment, and will fulfill its
obligations under the applicable one of Section 4.1(q) and Section 4.2(f). Unless otherwise required by law, the parties will in all Tax Returns report the
Merger in a manner consistent with the intention described in the first sentence and no party will take a position inconsistent

with that treatment (whether in audits, in court proceedings or otherwise), unless required to do otherwise as a result of a final “determination” as
defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code (or pursuant to any similar provision of applicable law).

9.19 Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties The representations and warranties in this Agreement will terminate at the Effective Time,
and after the Effective Time, nobody will be able to bring a claim based on any inaccuracy in, or anything else regarding, any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement.

9.20 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid, void or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction or as a
result of future legislative action, so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party or its stockholders, such holding or action shall be strictly construed and shall not affect the validity or effect of
any other provision hereof, as long as the remaining provisions, taken together, are sufficient to carry out the overall intentions of the parties as
evidenced hereby. The parties further agree to negotiate in good faith to replace any such invalid, void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement
with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, void or
unenforceable provision.

9.21 Parent Guarantee. Parent agrees to take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all
of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement. Parent unconditionally guarantees to the Company the full and complete
performance by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be liable to the
same extent as Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this Agreement. This is a guarantee of performance and not of collectability. Parent hereby waives
diligence, presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any proceeding first against Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in connection with the performance of its obligations set forth in this Section 9.21.

9.22 Extension of Time; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or covenants of the other parties contained herein; provided, that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained or the Parent
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, as the case may be, no waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable law or stock exchange rules requires
further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent, as the case may be, without such further approval or
adoption. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed and delivered on behalf
of such party. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial waiver of any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce any right or power, or any similar course of conduct,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.

ANNEX C
 

October 29th, 2017

The Board of Directors
CalAtlantic Group, Inc.
15260 Barranca Parkway
Irvine, California 92618

Members of the Board of Directors:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
“Company Common Stock”), of CalAtlantic Group, Inc. (the “Company”) of the Consideration (as defined below) in the proposed merger (the
“Transaction”) of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lennar Corporation (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of October 29th, 2017 (the “Agreement”), among the Company, the Acquiror and its subsidiary, Cheetah Cub Group Corp. (“Merger
Sub”), the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than
shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury or owned by the Company, the Acquiror or Merger Sub and other Excluded Shares (as defined in
the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive 0.885 shares (the “Stock Consideration”) of the Acquiror’s common stock, par value $0.10
per share (the “Acquiror Common Stock”), unless an election is made by the holder thereof to receive $48.26 in cash (the “Cash Consideration”, with
the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration referred to in this letter as the “Consideration”). The Consideration will be subject to certain
proration procedures based on the number of shares for which Cash Consideration is elected as set forth in the Agreement. We express no view or
opinion as to such proration procedures.

In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial
information concerning the Company and the Acquiror and the industries in which they operate; (iii) compared the financial and operating
performance of the Company and the Acquiror with publicly available information concerning certain other companies we deemed relevant and
reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock and the Acquiror Common Stock and certain publicly traded
securities of such other companies; (iv) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company and the
management of the Acquiror relating to their respective businesses, as well as respective adjustments and extrapolations made by the management of
the Company to such projections of both businesses; (v) reviewed estimates of amounts and timing of the cost savings and related expenses and
synergies expected to result from the Transaction (the “Synergies”), as provided by the management of the Company based on their discussions with
the management of the Acquiror; and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as we deemed
appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.

In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company and the Acquiror with respect to certain aspects of the
Transaction, and the past and current business operations of the Company and the Acquiror, the financial condition and future prospects and operations
of the Company and the Acquiror, the effects of the Transaction on the financial condition and future prospects of the Company and the Acquiror, and
certain other matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.

In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished
to or discussed with us by the Company and the Acquiror or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any such information
or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such
independent verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/878560/000119312518003465/d479768ddefm14a.htm 234/239

Table of Contents

assets or liabilities, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived therefrom, including the Synergies, we have
assumed that they have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management
as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company and the Acquiror to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We
express no view as to such analyses or forecasts (including the Synergies) or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also assumed that the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax
purposes, and will be consummated as described in the Agreement. We have also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the
Company and the Acquiror in the Agreement and the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are
not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. We have further
assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained
without any adverse effect on the Company or the Acquiror or on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date
hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or
reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the
Consideration to be received by such holders in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid
in connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the
underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any
compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be
received by the holders of the Company Common Stock in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. We are expressing
no opinion herein as to the price at which the Company Common Stock or the Acquiror Common Stock will trade at any future time.

We note that we were not authorized to and did not solicit any expressions of interest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of
the Company or any other alternative transaction.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee from the Company for our services,
a substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed Transaction is consummated. A portion of our fee will become payable upon
delivery of this opinion. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two
years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company and the
Acquiror, for which we and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead
arranger and joint lead bookrunner on the Company’s credit facility in October 2015, as lead-left bookrunner on an offering of debt securities by the
Company in May 2016, as active bookrunner on an sale of equity securities of the Company in June 2017, and as joint bookrunner on an offering of
debt securities by the Company in June 2017; as joint bookrunner on offerings of debt securities by the Acquiror in October 2015, February 2016 and
April 2017, as lead left bookrunner on an offering of debt securities by the Acquiror in January 2017, and as sole bookrunner and joint lead arranger on
the Acquiror’s credit facility in June 2016 and May 2017. In addition, during such period, we and our affiliates have provided loan syndication, and
debt and equity underwriting services to portfolio companies of MatlinPatterson Global Advisers LLC, which portfolio companies are unrelated to the
proposed Transaction. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of the Company,
the Acquiror and such portfolio companies as are referred to in the preceding sentence, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial
benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of the Company and the
Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and

equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or the Acquiror for our own account
or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of the Company Common Stock.

The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This letter is provided to the Board of
Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not
constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of the Company as to how such shareholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other
matter. This opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with
our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any joint proxy statement/prospectus or information statement mailed to
