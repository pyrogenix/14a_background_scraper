Tender Offer

        This Schedule 14D-9 relates to the tender offer (the "Offer") by Galileo Acquisition Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser"),
which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Open Text Corporation, a corporation incorporated under the federal laws of Canada ("Parent"), to
purchase any and all Company Shares that are issued and outstanding, at a purchase price of $7.10 per Company Share (the "Offer Price")
net to the seller thereof in cash, without interest, and less any required withholding taxes, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated August 8, 2017 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Offer to Purchase"),
and the related Letter of Transmittal (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Letter of Transmittal"). The Offer to
Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal are filed as Exhibits (a)(1) and (a)(2), respectively, hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.
The Offer is described in a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed by Purchaser and Parent with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") on August 8, 2017 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Schedule TO"). Any
Company Shares tendered by notice of guaranteed delivery but not actually delivered to the depositary of the Offer prior to the Expiration
Date (as defined below) will not be considered validly tendered until so delivered.

        The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 25, 2017, by and among the Company, Parent
and Purchaser (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"). The Merger Agreement provides, among other things,
that as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions and in accordance

Company will be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger will be effected under Section 251(h) of the
DGCL, which provides that following consummation of a tender offer for a corporation that has a class or series of

stock that is listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders immediately prior to the execution of the
agreement of merger, and subject to certain statutory provisions, if the acquiror holds at least the amount of shares of each class of stock of
the corporation that is being acquired would otherwise be required to adopt the agreement of merger, and the stockholders that did not
tender their shares in the tender offer receive the same consideration for their stock in the merger as was payable in the tender offer, the
acquiror can effect a merger without the vote or written consent of the stockholders of the acquired corporation. Accordingly, if Purchaser
consummates the Offer, the Merger Agreement contemplates that the parties will effect the closing of the Merger without a vote of the
stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

        Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the obligation of Purchaser to purchase the Company Shares validly tendered in the Offer
is subject to the following conditions: (a) that immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (the "Expiration Date") there shall have
been validly tendered in the Offer (in the aggregate), and not withdrawn (and excluding any Company Shares tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been received (as defined in Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL)), that number of
Company Shares that, together with the number of Company Shares (if any) then owned by Purchaser, Parent and their respective
controlled affiliates, equal at least a majority of the Company Shares then issued and outstanding (the "Minimum Condition"), (b) that, at
the Expiration Date, the following conditions shall have been satisfied (or have been waived): (i) the applicable waiting period, together
with any extensions thereof, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (the "HSR Act") shall have
expired or been terminated (the "HSR Condition"), (ii) the agreement by the Defense Security Service ("DSS") in the form of a
commitment letter reflecting acceptance by DSS of a plan to mitigate foreign ownership, control and influence over the Company (the
"DSS Consent") shall have been obtained (the "DSS Condition"), (iii) no law or order of any governmental authority with competent
jurisdiction shall be in effect which (y) restrains, prohibits or otherwise makes illegal the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or
(z) except as contemplated by Section 5.5(f) of the Merger Agreement, imposes any limitations on the ownership or operation by Parent
(or any of its subsidiaries) of all or any portion of the businesses or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, or
compels Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any portion of the businesses or assets
of Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries (the condition described in this sub-paragraph (iii), together with the HSR
Condition and DSS Condition, the "Regulatory Conditions"), (iv) that no legal proceeding shall have been commenced and be pending
by any United States federal or state or foreign governmental authority of competent jurisdiction seeking an order that would have any of
the effects referred to in subparagraph (iii) above, (v) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Merger
Agreement must be true and correct as of the Expiration Date (except that those representations and warranties which address matters only
as of a particular date need only be true and correct as of such date), subject to applicable materiality thresholds, (vi) the Company must
have complied with or performed in all material respects all covenants and obligations that the Company is required to comply with or to
perform at or prior to the Expiration Date; (vii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate signed by an executive officer of
the Company and dated as of the Expiration Date to the effect that the conditions described in the foregoing sub-paragraphs (v) and
(vi) have been satisfied, (vii) that the Merger Agreement shall not have been validly terminated in accordance with its terms and (viii) that
since the date of the Merger Agreement, no Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) shall have occurred.

        As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any Company Shares, each Company Share outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), other than each Company Share (a) owned by the Company
or Parent or a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or Parent, which will be cancelled and cease to exist without any

exercised and validly perfected appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Company Shares) will be converted
into the right to receive an amount of cash per Company Share equal to the Offer Price (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest
thereon and less any required withholding taxes, payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing, or
book-entry transfer of, such Company Shares.

        In addition, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (a) each outstanding, unexpired and unexercised option (a "Company Option")
to purchase Company Shares granted pursuant to the Guidance Software, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 2004 Equity Incentive Plan
(as amended from time to time) or the Guidance Software, Inc. 2017 Incentive Award Plan (as amended from time to time) (the
"Company Stock Plans"), that is vested and exercisable or that, by the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan or award agreement,
would automatically become vested and exercisable as a result of the occurrence of the Transactions (as defined below) (each, a "Vested
Option"), shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a payment in cash (net of
applicable withholding taxes and without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Company Shares subject to
such Vested Option immediately prior to such cancellation and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price
per Company Share subject to such Vested Option immediately prior to such cancellation, and (b) each award of restricted Company
Shares ("Company Restricted Shares") granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding and vested or that, by the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plan or award agreement, would automatically become vested as a result of the Transactions (the "Vested
Restricted Shares") shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a payment in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding taxes and without interest) equal to the product of (i) the total number of Vested Restricted Shares
immediately prior to such cancellation (which, in the case of awards of performance-vesting Company Restricted Shares, shall be
calculated at "Target Level" performance) and (ii) the Merger Consideration, in each case as set forth in Item 3 under the heading
"Agreements or Arrangements with Executive Officers and Directors of the Company". No Company Options or Company Restricted
Shares shall be continued, converted, assumed or replaced by the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger.

        From and after the date of the Merger Agreement until the Acceptance Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or, if earlier, the
termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company (or the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") or any committee
thereof, as applicable) must, and must cause its affiliates and direct their respective representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions and negotiations with third parties regarding any Competing Proposal (as defined in the Merger
Agreement); terminate access by any third party to any data room relating to a potential Competing Transaction (as defined in the Merger
Agreement); in accordance with the applicable confidentiality agreements with third parties, request the prompt return or destruction of
any confidential information provided to any third party in the 12 months immediately preceding the date of the Merger Agreement in
connection with a Competing Proposal; and enforce the provisions of any existing confidentiality agreements entered into with respect to
any potential Competing Transaction (provided, that the Company shall be permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce, any standstill
provision to the extent necessary to permit the counterparty thereto to make a confidential Competing Proposal directly to the Company
Board in accordance with the terms of the non-solicitation provisions in the Merger Agreement). Further, the Company must not, must
cause its affiliates not to, and shall direct its and their representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate
or encourage the submission of any Competing Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for information regarding or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, a Competing Proposal, (b) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with,
furnish any information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the offices, books and records of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to, any person with respect to inquiries,

proposals or requests for information regarding, or that would reasonably, be expected to lead to, or the making of a Competing Proposal,
(c) make an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or (d) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of
intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement)) relating to a Competing Proposal or potential Competing Transaction
(as defined in the Merger Agreement) or requiring or reasonably expected to cause the Company to abandon, terminate, materially delay,
fail to consummate, or that would otherwise materially impede or interfere with, the Merger or any of the other Transactions. The violation
of the restrictions set forth in the non-solicitation covenant by any affiliate of the Company or any representative of the Company or any of
its affiliates shall constitute a breach of the non-solicitation covenant by the Company, including for the purposes of certain termination
rights of Parent under the Merger Agreement. For the purposes of the restrictions described in this paragraph, none of Shawn McCreight,
Jennifer McCreight, PRIMECAP Management Company, RGM Capital, LLC or any of their respective affiliates that beneficially own any
Company Shares (other than any subsidiary of the Company) shall be deemed an affiliate of the Company.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, if at any time following the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company or any of its representatives receives a bona fide unsolicited written Competing Proposal from a third party (which
Competing Proposal was initially made after the date of the Merger Agreement and did not result from a breach of Section 5.3 of the
Merger Agreement), and the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal and financial
advisors, based on the information then available, that such Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), subject to the restrictions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company may
engage in discussions or negotiations with such third party and provide such third party with information so long as the Company complies
with procedural requirements contained in the Merger Agreement.

        If (a)(i) the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited written Competing Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by
the Company Board to the Company and the stockholders of the Company under applicable law, then the Company Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal or (b) the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to material events, changes or
developments in circumstances that were not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of or prior to the Acceptance
Time if the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owned by the Company Board to the Company and
the stockholders of the Company under applicable law, in the case of each of clause (a) and (b), so long as the Company complies with
applicable procedural requirements contained in the Merger Agreement.

        The Merger Agreement is summarized in the Offer to Purchase in Section 11 under the heading "Purpose of the Offer and Plans for
Guidance; Merger Agreement and Other Agreements." The summary of the Merger Agreement set forth in the Offer to Purchase and any
summary of provisions of the Merger Agreement set forth herein do not purport to be complete and each is qualified in its entirety by

Table of Contents

        Holders of Company Shares and other interested parties should read the Merger Agreement for a more complete description of the
provisions summarized in the Offer to Purchase. The Merger Agreement has been provided solely to inform holders of Company Shares of
its terms. It is not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, a source of financial, business or operational information about the
Company, Parent, Purchaser or their respective affiliates.

        The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors and stockholders with information regarding the terms of the
Transactions. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Parent, Purchaser, the Company, or their respective
affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only as of specified dates for the
purposes of such agreement, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement and may be subject to qualifications and
limitations agreed upon by such parties. In particular, in reviewing the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger
Agreement, it is important to bear in mind that such representations, warranties and covenants were negotiated with the principal purpose
of allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts. Such representations, warranties and covenants may also be
subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed
with the SEC, and in some cases were qualified by disclosures set forth in a confidential disclosure letter that was provided by the
Company to Parent and Purchaser but is not filed with the SEC as part of the Merger Agreement. Investors and stockholders should not
rely on such representations, warranties and covenants as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances described therein
without consideration of the entirety of the factual disclosures about the Company, Parent and Purchaser made in this Schedule 14D-9, the
Schedule TO or reports filed with the SEC. Information concerning the subject matter of such representations, warranties and covenants,
which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this Schedule 14D-9, may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement,
which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the parties' public disclosures.

Tender and Voting Agreement

        Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, on July 25, 2017, Parent and Purchaser entered into a tender
and voting agreement with each of the Company's directors, as well as Patrick Dennis, the Company's President and Chief Executive
Officer, Barry J. Plaga, its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, Alfredo Gomez, its General Counsel, Ken Basore, its
Senior Vice President of Product Engineering, Michael Harris, its Chief Marketing Officer, Stephanie Urbach, its Senior Vice President for
Human Resources, and Rasmus Van Der Colff, its Vice President for Finance and Chief Accounting Officer (the "Tender Agreement")
pursuant to which each such person agreed, among other things, to (a) accept the Offer and tender their Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer, and (b) to vote against (i) any Competing Proposal or any proposal related to a Competing Proposal, (ii) any merger (other than the
Merger), consolidation or other combination involving the Company or the subsidiaries of the Company or a reorganization,
recapitalization, extraordinary dividend, dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any of the subsidiaries of the Company, (iii) to the
extent submitted to a stockholder vote, any change in the business, management or Company Board (other than as directed by Parent or
Purchaser) or (iv) any other action, proposal or agreement that would (x) reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, materially
delay or postpone the Merger and the Transactions, (y) result in any of the conditions to the Offer or conditions to the Merger not being
fulfilled or satisfied or (z) change in any manner the dividend policy or capitalization of, including the voting rights of any class of equity
interests in, the Company.

exceptions, to keep confidential certain non-public information about the Company and to use it only for specified purposes. This

and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and in reaching its decision to approve the
Merger Agreement and the Transactions.

Director and Officer Indemnification, Advancement of Expenses and Insurance

        Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL allows a corporation, by provision of its certificate of incorporation, to eliminate the personal liability
of its directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for a breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except where the
director breached his duty of loyalty, failed to act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct or knowingly violated a law, authorized
the payment of a dividend or approved a stock repurchase in violation of the DGCL, or engaged in a transaction from which the director
derived an improper personal benefit. The Company has included in its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the
"Charter") a provision to limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as it now
exists or may in the future be amended.

        Section 145 of the DGCL provides that a corporation has the power to indemnify a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation and certain other persons serving at the request of the corporation in related capacities with other entities against amounts paid
and expenses incurred in connection with an action or proceeding to which he is or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact
that he holds such position, if such person shall have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the corporation, and, in (i) any criminal proceeding, if such person had no reasonable cause to believe his or her
conduct was unlawful or (ii) any action or suit by or in the right of the Company, only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred and,
unless otherwise provided by an appropriate court, only as to claims, issues or matters as to which such person is not ultimately adjudged
to be liable to the Company. The Company has included in the Charter and its Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws")
provisions that require the Company to provide the indemnification to current and former directors and officers to the fullest extent
authorized by the DGCL, as it presently exists or may in the future be amended,. The Company has also included in its Charter and the
Bylaws a provision that permits the Company, at the discretion of the Company Board, to provide the foregoing indemnification to
employees and agents of the Company to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as it presently exists or may in the future be amended.
In addition, pursuant to the Bylaws, the Company is required to advance expenses incurred by any director or officer in connection with
any such proceeding upon receipt of a written request and, if required by the DGCL, an undertaking by such director or officer to repay the
amount so advanced

if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company for such expenses.

        Prior to entering into the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into indemnification agreements with Reynolds Bish, Scipio M.
Carnecchia, John Colbert, Patrick Dennis, Wade Loo, Michael McConnell, Barry Plaga, Rasmus van der Colff and Robert van
Schoonenberg. The indemnification agreements require the Company, among other things, to indemnify such directors and executive
officers for certain expenses, and, except in an action brought by or in the right of the Company, judgments, fines and settlement amounts
actually and reasonably incurred by such director or executive officer, in any action or proceeding, arising out of his service as one of the
Company's directors or executive officers or any other company or enterprise to which he provides services at the Company's request, and
require the Company to provide coverage to such director or executive officer under any directors' and officers' insurance policies
maintained by the Company during the term of each agreement.

        The Merger Agreement provides that the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time must (and, Parent must
cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its subsidiaries under the indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any of their
respective current or former directors, officers and employees, and any person who becomes a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Persons") and indemnification, expense advancement
and exculpation provisions in the Charter and Bylaws or comparable organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
in effect on the date of this Agreement. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries must cause the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are no less favorable than the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions contained in the organizational documents of the Company and its subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such
six year period, such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the Indemnified Persons
except as required by law.

        Further, under the Merger Agreement, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must, and must
cause its subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the current or former directors or officers of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, in
respect of acts or omissions by such persons in their capacity as directors or officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by law.

        Prior to the Effective Time, the Company must or, if the Company is unable to, the Surviving Corporation must as of the Effective
Time, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's
existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claim
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time
at or prior to the Effective Time. However, Parent and the Surviving Corporation are not required to pay annual premiums in excess of
250% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the Effective Time.

        If following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of

its properties and assets to any entity, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in the insurance and indemnification provisions
of the Merger Agreement described above.

Employee Matters

        The Merger Agreement provides that for a period of twelve months following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or an
applicable subsidiary shall provide to each employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries who, as of the closing of the Merger,
continues his or her employment with the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their affiliates (each, a "Continuing
Employee") base compensation, bonus or incentive opportunities (excluding any equity or equity-based plan, program or arrangement),
and employee and fringe benefits (including severance benefits and group health, life and disability plans, but excluding benefits provided
pursuant to any defined benefit pension plan) that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, taken as a whole, to the base compensation,
bonus or incentive opportunities and employee and fringe benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

        The Merger Agreement further provides that, from and after the Effective Time, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant under any benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective affiliates (each, a "Parent Benefit Plan"), Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each Continuing Employee to receive service credit for service with the Company and its subsidiaries to the same extent such service
credit was granted under the Company's benefit plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall also use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions, actively at work requirements, waiting periods and
insurability requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees (and any
dependents or beneficiaries thereof) under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not been
satisfied as of the Effective Time and (ii) cause any co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by a Continuing
Employee during the plan year that includes the Effective Time to be credited for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payment and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year of each comparable Parent Benefit Plan. Parent shall also use commercially reasonable efforts to honor all vacation, personal and sick
days accrued by Continuing Employees under the plans, policies, programs and arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

stockholders, (b) approved, adopted and declared advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders the

Table of Contents

        Accordingly, and for the other reasons described in more detail below, the Company Board hereby recommends that the
Company's stockholders accept the Offer and tender all of their Company Shares pursuant to the Offer.

        A copy of the press release issued by the Company on July 26, 2017, announcing the Merger Agreement, the Offer and the Merger, is
filed as Exhibit (a)(3) to the Schedule 14D-9 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Background and Reasons for the Recommendation

Background of the Offer

        The Company Board and management of the Company have continually evaluated the Company's business and financial plans and
prospects. As part of this evaluation, the Company Board has periodically considered various strategic alternatives in an effort to enhance
value for the Company's stockholders.

        In August 2015, the Company evaluated the status of the Company's CaseCentral business (the "CaseCentral Business"). The
CaseCentral Business had not performed to expectations since the Company acquired it in February 2012, and the Company determined it
likely would need to make significant investments in the CaseCentral Business for it to perform to expectations. On August 20, 2015,
representatives of management met with Piper Jaffray & Co. ("Piper Jaffray") to discuss potential strategic alternatives for the
CaseCentral Business. At the meeting, Piper Jaffray also discussed a list of strategic parties and financial sponsors that could be potentially
interested in pursuing a transaction with the CaseCentral Business.

        On September 8, 2015, the Company entered into an engagement letter with Piper Jaffray as the Company's exclusive financial
advisor to assess potential strategic alternatives for the CaseCentral Business.

        From September 2015 through January 2016, Piper Jaffray contacted 15 potentially interested parties, one of which was Parent, and
executed confidentiality agreements with eight parties. Of these parties, two submitted proposals to acquire the CaseCentral Business, as
described below (such parties are referred to as "Party A" and "Party B" below).

        On December 1, 2015, following a request by Party A for a meeting, members of management and representatives of Party A met at
the Company's headquarters in Pasadena, California, for an introductory meeting. At the meeting, Party A indicated that it could be
interested in a transaction with the Company, but did not make any proposals and management did not share any material non-public
information with Party A.

        On January 6, 2016, the Company received a non-binding term sheet from Party B to purchase the Company's eDiscovery business,
including the CaseCentral Business, for up to $10 million.

        On January 13, 2016, Shawn McCreight, the Company's founder, Chief Technology Officer and trustee of the largest stockholder of
the Company, The McCreight Living Trust, ceased to be an employee of the Company.

        On January 15, 2016, following the termination of Mr. McCreight's employment with the Company, the Company Board held a
meeting attended by a member of management and a representative of Latham & Watkins LLP, counsel to the Company ("Latham &
Watkins"). During the meeting, the Company Board voted to replace Mr. McCreight as Chairman of the Company Board, and formed a
committee of the Company Board comprised solely of independent directors (the "Independent Committee") with the purpose of
providing the members of the Company Board a separate forum to discuss matters related to the operation of the business of the Company
and to make recommendations for approval by the Company Board with respect to measures aimed at safeguarding

the interests of both the Company and its stockholders. The initial members of the Independent Committee were Robert Van
Schoonenberg, Christopher Poole, and Max Carnecchia. Subsequently, on February 26, 2016, the Company Board added Reynolds C. Bish
and Wade Loo to the Independent Committee.

        On February 9, 2016, the Company Board held a meeting attended by members of management and a representative of Latham &
Watkins. At the meeting, the Company Board determined to form an M&A Committee of the Company Board (the "M&A Committee")
with the purpose of evaluating potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, corporate development opportunities, divestitures and other
key strategic transactions outside the ordinary course of the Company's business, including the potential sale of the CaseCentral Business.
The initial members of the M&A Committee were Mr. Patrick Dennis, Mr. Poole and Mr. Carnecchia.

        On February 10, 2016, Mr. McCreight delivered a stockholder nomination letter to the Company seeking to replace all members of
the Company Board that were serving at that time.

        On February 11, 2016, the Company received notice from Mr. McCreight of his intention to nominate five directors for election to the
Company Board at the Company's 2016 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2016 Annual Meeting").

        On February 16, 2016, the Company received a non-binding letter of intent and term sheet from Party C, a privately held company, to
purchase the CaseCentral Business for $14 million. The letter of intent contemplated an exclusivity period of at least 30 days to negotiate
the definitive purchase agreement with respect to the proposed transaction.

        On February 19, 2016, the M&A Committee held a meeting attended by members of management and a representative of Latham &
Watkins. At the meeting, the M&A Committee discussed the letter of intent that Party C sent to the Company, noting that the offered price
of $14 million was higher than any other offers the Company had received for the CaseCentral Business. The M&A Committee authorized
management of the Company to continue negotiations with Party C with respect to its proposed offer for the purchase of the CaseCentral
Business.

        On February 22, 2016, the Company received a revised non-binding letter of intent from Party C to purchase the Company's
CaseCentral Business for $15 million. The revised letter of intent also contemplated a 30 day exclusivity period to negotiate the definitive
purchase agreement with respect to the proposed transaction. The M&A Committee unanimously approved the Company's entry into the
revised non-binding letter of intent, including the granting of exclusivity as requested by Party C, by written consent on February 22, 2016,
and the Company entered into the letter of intent on the same day.

        On March 11, 2016, Messrs. Dennis and Plaga met with representatives of Party D, at the Company's headquarters in Pasadena,
California, following a request by Party D to a significant stockholder of the Company for an introduction to the Company's management.
Messrs. Dennis and Plaga did not share any material non-public information with Party D at the meeting.

        On March 30, 2016, the Company filed its definitive proxy statement for the 2016 Annual Meeting pursuant to which it nominated
each of its incumbent directors to the Company Board. From early February 2016 through late April 2016, each of the Company and
Mr. McCreight made a number of filings with the SEC in connection with the proxy contest initiated by Mr. McCreight.

        On April 4, 2016, the Independent Committee held a meeting attended by members of management. At the meeting, the Independent
Committee discussed Mr. Dennis' meeting with Party D. The Independent Committee determined that it would be premature to discuss a
strategic transaction involving the sale of the Company with Party D while the proxy contest with Mr. McCreight was ongoing. During the
meeting, the Independent Committee also noted that, during its due diligence on

the CaseCentral Business, Party C had indicated that it believed it would need to make significant investments in the CaseCentral Business
if Party C were to acquire it. The Independent Committee noted that, in light of these concerns, Party C had stated that it would
significantly reduce its proposed purchase price for the CaseCentral Business and, as a result, the transaction would not proceed.

        On April 9, 2016, the Company received an unsolicited and non-binding indication of interest from Party D to purchase the Company
for $6 per share.

        On April 11, 2016, the M&A Committee held a meeting attended by other members of the Company Board, members of
management, a representative of Latham & Watkins and a representative of Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A., Delaware counsel to the
Company ("Richards Layton"). At the meeting, Mr. Dennis discussed the meeting he had with Party D at its headquarters, and the
unsolicited non-binding indication of interest Party D had delivered to the Company. The M&A Committee discussed the indication of
interest from Party D, and the merits of retaining a financial advisor to advise the Company in evaluating the indication of interest from
Party D. Following the discussion, the M&A Committee authorized management to seek proposals from a list of identified financial
advisors to serve in connection with evaluating the indication of interest from Party D. The M&A Committee also authorized Mr. Dennis
to respond to Party D that the Board would require additional time to consider the indication of interest.

        On April 13, 2016, the Independent Committee held a meeting attended by members of management, a representative of Latham &
Watkins and representatives of a significant stockholder of the Company. At the meeting, a representative of the significant stockholder
discussed the proxy contest with Mr. McCreight and the negative impact it was having on the Company and the trading price of its
common stock. At the meeting, no material nonpublic information was shared with the representatives of the significant stockholder.

        On April 18, 2016, the M&A Committee held a meeting attended by other members of the Company Board, members of
management, a representative of Latham & Watkins and a representative of Richards Layton. At the meeting, Mr. Carnecchia discussed
the indication of interest Party D had sent to the Company. The M&A Committee discussed whether to initiate a potential strategic sale
process for the Company, and whether to retain a financial advisor in connection with such process. Following the discussion, the M&A
Committee reaffirmed its authorization for management to interview potential financial advisors as no financial advisor had been retained
since the April 11, 2016 meeting of the M&A Committee.

        Between April 18 and April 22, 2016, the M&A Committee met with four potential financial advisors, including Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley") and Atlas Technology Group, LLC ("Atlas").

        On April 22, 2016, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") with Mr. McCreight and his
affiliated entities that were stockholders of the Company. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, among other things, (a) Messrs. Poole
and McCreight resigned from the Company Board, (b) Messrs. Colbert and McConnell were appointed to the Company Board following
their approval by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Company Board, (c) Mr. McCreight and his affiliated entities agreed
to comply with customary standstill provisions and (d) the Company agreed that, upon retaining a financial advisor, the Company Board
would consider strategic alternatives for the Company, including the potential sale of the Company. Following the Company's entry into
the Settlement Agreement, Mr. Poole was removed as a member of the M&A Committee in connection with his resignation from the
Company Board and Messrs. Bish and McConnell were appointed as members of the M&A Committee.

        On April 22, 2016, the M&A Committee held a meeting attended by other members of the Company Board, members of management
and a representative of Latham & Watkins. During the

meeting, the M&A Committee discussed the meetings it had held with the four potential financial advisors. After discussion, the M&A
Committee determined that management should contact two of the potential financial advisors, one of which would be Atlas, to request
proposals for their respective proposed engagement by the Company in connection with the potential sale of the Company.

        On April 26, 2016, the Company Board dissolved the Independent Committee.

        On May 11, 2016, the M&A Committee held a meeting attended by other members of the Company Board, members of management
and a representative of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, the M&A Committee discussed the proposals provided by the two potential
financial advisors, including their respective proposed fee arrangements. The M&A Committee determined to recommend to the Company
Board to retain Atlas as the financial advisor to the Company in connection with the review of the Company's strategic alternatives,
including the potential sale of the Company. The M&A Committee also discussed the status of the potential sale of the CaseCentral
Business. The M&A Committee noted that, after Party C had signaled to the Company that Party C would significantly reduce its
proposed purchase price for the CaseCentral Business, the sale process had ended without any willing buyers on acceptable terms and the
Company would instead look for ways to strengthen the CaseCentral Business' relationship with its largest customer. Additionally, the
M&A Committee discussed the indication of interest it had received from Party D. The M&A Committee noted that the trading price of
the Company's common stock had been depressed as a result of the proxy contest with Mr. McCreight, and that it believed that Party D's
proposed purchase price was insufficient. On May 10, 2016, the closing price of the Company's common stock on Nasdaq was $5.19 per
share. After discussion, the M&A Committee determined to recommend to the Board not to pursue a transaction with Party D at that time
and that Mr. Carnecchia would relay that message to Party D. Finally, the M&A Committee noted that Party E reportedly was interested in
a sale of its business, but was facing issues that could make a combination of Party E and the Company inadvisable. The M&A Committee
noted that Atlas would be willing to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding the Company's strategic alternatives at no cost
to the Company, unless the Company consummated a sale transaction with a third party (in which case the Company would be required to
pay a fee to Atlas). Following the discussion, the M&A Committee recommended to the Company Board to retain Atlas as the Company's
non-exclusive financial advisor, and to continue to consider other potential advisors to assist the Company Board in its review of strategic
alternatives.

        On May 11, 2016, the Company Board held a meeting attended by members of management and a representative of Latham &
Watkins. At the meeting, among other things, the Company Board discussed the matters discussed at the M&A Committee's May 11, 2016
meeting, including the M&A Committee's recommendations with respect to the Company's response to Party D's indication of interest and
the approval of Atlas as the non-exclusive financial advisor of the Company. The Company Board determined to retain Atlas as its non-
exclusive financial advisor and authorized the M&A Committee and Mr. Carnecchia to deliver a letter informing Party C that the
Company would not be pursuing its proposal at that time.

        On May 16, 2016, the Company sent a letter to Party D, indicating that Party D's proposal understated the value of the Company and
that it would not be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders to pursue a transaction with Party D on such terms at that time.

        On May 17, 2016, the Company entered into an engagement letter with Atlas on the terms approved by the M&A Committee and the
Company Board to assist the Company in a review of its strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company.

        On July 19, 2016, the M&A Committee held a meeting attended by other members of the Company Board, members of management,
a representative of Latham & Watkins and representatives of Atlas. At the meeting, the M&A Committee discussed the Company's three-
year financial model that had been prepared by management and provided to the M&A Committee in advance of the

meeting. Also, at the meeting, representatives of Atlas made a presentation to the M&A Committee regarding the strategic alternatives
available to the Company, including, without limitation, (a) remaining as a stand-alone company, (b) raising additional capital, (c) selling
the Company's CaseCentral and/or Tableau businesses or (d) selling the entire Company. During the meeting, the M&A Committee
discussed the identities of other parties that could be possible acquirers of the Company.

        On July 29, 2016, the Company received a revised indication of interest from Party D proposing to purchase the Company at or above
$7 per share in cash.

        On July 29, 2016, the Company Board held a meeting attended by members of management and a representative of Latham &
Watkins. At the meeting, the Company Board discussed Party D's revised indication of interest and determined that it would not be in the
best interests of the Company to engage solely with Party D at that time. The Company Board instead determined that it should consider
all of its strategic alternatives and, if the Company Board were to pursue a sale, it should conduct a sale process in which Party D could
participate. The Company Board directed management of the Company to respond to Party D that the Company was not interested in
pursuing a sale to Party D at that time but that the Company would be in contact with Party D if it determined to pursue a sale process.

        On August 12, 2016, by email, a mutual contact introduced Mark Barrenechea, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer
of Parent, and Douglas Parker, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Parent, to Mr. Dennis to broach interest in a strategic
discussion. During this conversation, Mr. Dennis stated that he was not in a position to discuss a potential sale of the Company, but would
communicate Mr. Barrenechea's interest to the Company Board.

        On August 21, 2016, Mr. Barrenechea called Mr. Dennis and expressed interest in further discussions.

        On August 25, 2016, the M&A Committee held a meeting attended by another member of the Company Board, members of
management and a representative of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, the M&A Committee discussed proposals from four potential
financial advisors to the Company. The M&A Committee discussed the relative industry knowledge and breadth of experience and other
characteristics of each of the potential financial advisors, and considered which financial advisor it believed would be best suited to assist
the Company in its review of its strategic alternatives. After discussion, the M&A Committee determined to recommend to the Company
Board that the Company retain Morgan Stanley, on the terms presented to the M&A Committee, to be the Company's financial advisor
because of Morgan Stanley's familiarity with the Company, experience in the cyber security industry, investment banking experience and
general industry knowledge. Additionally, at the meeting, Mr. Dennis discussed the call he had held with Mr. Barrenechea on August 21,
2016.

        On August 31, 2016, the Company Board held a meeting attended by members of management and representatives of Latham &
Watkins. At the meeting, the Company Board discussed the M&A Committee's recommendation that the Company Board should retain
Morgan Stanley as an additional financial advisor to the Company. The Company Board also discussed a proposed engagement letter with
Morgan Stanley, as well as the process and timing for outreach to potentially interested parties in connection with the possible sale of the
Company. At the meeting, the Company Board determined to engage Morgan Stanley as the Company's financial advisor and approved the
terms of the engagement letter. The Company Board determined to retain Morgan Stanley because of its familiarity with the Company,
experience in the cyber security industry, investment banking experience and general industry knowledge. On August 31, 2016, the
Company entered into the engagement letter with Morgan Stanley (as amended or supplemented, the "Morgan Stanley Engagement
Letter").

        During September and early October 2016, Morgan Stanley conducted a review of strategic alternatives available to the Company,
including a possible sale of the Company. During this time, Morgan Stanley met with management and the Company Board to discuss a
list of strategic parties and financial sponsors that could be potentially interested in pursuing a transaction involving the sale of the
Company.

        On October 17, 2016, the Company Board held a meeting attended by members of management, representatives of Latham &
Watkins and representatives from Morgan Stanley. At the meeting, the Company Board reviewed a management presentation that would
be provided to parties interested in the possible acquisition of the Company, which included the October 2016 Management Projections (as
defined in "—Management Projections"). Morgan Stanley also discussed with the Company Board a list of potential strategic parties and
financial sponsors that could be contacted in connection with a sale process, which were selected based on their expected interest and
ability to complete a transaction with the Company. Morgan Stanley did not include Party A on the list of potential interested parties
because based on Party A's relatively low market capitalization and other factors, Party A was not expected to have the financial capability
or credibility to complete a transaction with the Company. Morgan Stanley also discussed a sale process timeline with the Company
Board. After discussion, the Board approved the management presentation and authorized Morgan Stanley to contact, on behalf of the
Company, the parties on the list discussed with the Company Board.

        On October 25, 2016, a representative of Parent and Mr. Dennis discussed on the phone the sale process being administered by
Morgan Stanley. Mr. Dennis and the representative of Parent agreed that Parent should be included among potential bidders in the
Company's sale process.

        From the period of late October 2016 to November 2, 2016, Morgan Stanley contacted 30 potentially interested parties concerning the
sale process.

        On October 26, 2016, the M&A Committee held a meeting attended by other members of the Company Board, members of
management, representatives of Latham & Watkins and representatives of Morgan Stanley. At the meeting, Morgan Stanley provided the
M&A Committee with an update concerning Morgan Stanley's outreach to potentially interested parties, including strategic parties and
financial sponsors, and the expected timing for completion of the outreach process. At the meeting, Mr. Dennis noted that a representative
of Parent had called him and expressed interest in being involved in any sale process conducted by the Company. At the meeting, the
M&A Committee also discussed the possibility that the Company would need to contact Mr. McCreight regarding a sale transaction as a
potential buyer could request a voting or similar agreement with Mr. McCreight in connection with a sale transaction. The M&A
Committee noted that no material nonpublic information would be shared with Mr. McCreight unless he entered into a confidentiality
agreement with the Company. The M&A Committee requested two members of the Company Board to contact Mr. McCreight to confirm
whether he would be willing to enter into such a confidentiality agreement (without sharing any confidential information with him,
including regarding the existence and status of the strategic alternatives review process).

        On October 27, 2016, members of the Company's management and representatives of Morgan Stanley met with representatives of
Party D to discuss its interest in the possible acquisition of the Company.

        On October 28, 2016, a representative of Morgan Stanley provided Parent with information regarding a potential acquisition of the
Company, including a draft of the Confidentiality Agreement, sell-side research and a company overview.

        Between October 28 and November 9, 2016, representatives of Parent and the Company negotiated the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which Parent and the Company entered into on November 11, 2016.

        On November 1, 2016, Party A, on an unsolicited basis, contacted Morgan Stanley about its interest in pursuing a combination with
the Company in a transaction in which the stockholders of the Company would receive common stock of Party A and cash. On the same
day, Party A also submitted an indication of interest which, based on Party A's preliminary view of public information, valued the
Company Shares at a range from $7.70 to $8.70 per share. Party A also included in its indication of interest a request for exclusivity for a
period that would extend until January 31, 2017.

        As of November 2, 2016, Morgan Stanley had completed its initial outreach to potentially interested parties. As of such date, Morgan
Stanley had contacted 30 potentially interested parties (12 of which were strategic parties and 18 of which were financial sponsors). Of
these parties, 13 had entered into confidentiality agreements (two of which were strategic parties and 10 of which were financial sponsors)
with the Company. Each of the confidentiality agreements included a standstill provision that permitted the counterparty to make private
acquisition proposals to the Company Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. As of such date, of the 30 parties that were
contacted, seven parties (three of which were strategic parties and four of which were financial sponsors) had opted to pass on a potential
transaction with the Company. In addition, Morgan Stanley had received the indication of interest from Party A as described above.

        On November 2, 2016, the M&A Committee held a meeting attended by members of management, a representative of Latham &
Watkins and a representative of Morgan Stanley. At the meeting, a representative of Morgan Stanley provided an update on the status of
Morgan Stanley's initial outreach efforts to parties potentially interested in a possible acquisition of the Company. Among other things, the
representative of Morgan Stanley noted that Morgan Stanley had completed its initial outreach to the identified parties, that Party D had
met with the management of the Company and that Parent had scheduled an in-person meeting with the management of the Company in
November 2016. The M&A Committee noted that Party A had contacted Morgan Stanley regarding its interest in pursuing a transaction
with the Company. Following a discussion of the process to date and the proposals received, the Company Board authorized Morgan
Stanley to expand the scope of potentially interested strategic parties to include four additional parties identified as parties that would
potentially be interested in an acquisition of the Company.

        On November 11, 2016, Morgan Stanley provided a management presentation to Parent. Between November 11, 2016 and
November 30, 2016, Parent requested certain due diligence items, and Morgan Stanley provided information on behalf of the Company in
response to Parent's requests.

        On November 17 and 18, 2016, representatives of Parent, the Company and Morgan Stanley met in Pasadena, California to discuss
the companies' respective businesses.

        As of November 22, 2016, Morgan Stanley had contacted 33 potentially interested parties (15 of which were strategic parties and 18
of which were financial sponsors). As of such date, 12 potentially interested parties remained in the process (two of which were strategic
parties and 10 of which were financial sponsors), and 13 parties had entered into confidentiality agreements. Morgan Stanley
communicated a deadline of December 5, 2016, for the delivery of preliminary indications of interest to the potentially interested parties it
had contacted in connection with the sale process.

        On November 22, 2016, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by members of management, representatives of
Morgan Stanley and a representative of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, a representative of Morgan Stanley provided an update on the
status of the sale process, noting that Party D had requested consent to speak to debt financing sources pursuant to its confidentiality
agreement with the Company. After discussing the matter, the Company Board authorized the Company and Morgan Stanley to provide
the consent. A representative of Morgan Stanley discussed the proposal the Company had received from Party A to acquire the Company
for a combination of stock and cash. The Company Board discussed the proposal and noted that the valuation metrics in the proposal did
not appear to be valid, as it appeared to overstate the value of

Party A's common stock and, therefore, the Company Board did not yet have sufficient information to evaluate whether the proposal was
credible. The Company Board instructed Morgan Stanley to discuss Party A's proposal further with Party A to better understand its terms,
including how Party A arrived at its valuation of the two companies. The Company Board and Morgan Stanley discussed the potential
timing and process for a potential transaction.

        On November 29, 2016, representatives for Parent were granted access to an online data room for purposes of Parent's due diligence
review of the Company.

        During the period from November 11, 2016 to December 5, 2016, representatives of Parent engaged with the Company and its
financial advisors for the purposes of Parent's due diligence.

        On November 29, 2016, Party F entered into a confidentiality agreement in connection with the sale process. As of December 5,
2016, in addition to the indication of interest from Party A described above, Morgan Stanley had received the following indications of
interest:

• Party D proposed to acquire the Company for a purchase price at or above $7 per share of the Company's common stock.
Party D had indicated that it would be able to enter into a potential acquisition with the Company on an expedited basis. 

• Party G proposed to acquire the Company for a purchase price of $7.10 per share. Party G had indicated that it would be
able to enter into a potential acquisition with the Company on an expedited basis.

        On December 5, 2016, Parent informed Morgan Stanley that Parent would not meet the specified deadline to submit an indication of
interest in the Company's sale process, as Parent was continuing internal discussions regarding the potential transaction. At the time,
Parent was also in the process of completing the acquisition of another company.

        On December 6, 2016, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by members of management, representatives of Morgan
Stanley and representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, a representative of Morgan Stanley provided an update on the status of
the sale process, noting that it had received the indications of interest described above, as well as the proposal from Party A. The
representative of Morgan Stanley also noted that Morgan Stanley had held discussions with Party A regarding its proposal, and that its
proposal had not changed since it was submitted on November 1, 2016. The representative of Morgan Stanley noted that some of the
potentially interested parties had indicated potential interest at lower prices than those provided by Party D and Party G, but had not
submitted indications of interest. The representative of Morgan Stanley then discussed with the Company Board the conference calls that
Morgan Stanley and management of the Company had held with management of Party A noting that Morgan Stanley and management had
sought to obtain a better understanding of the valuation analysis that Party A had conducted to arrive at its proposed purchase price and the
value of its common stock, but that Party A management was unable to answer the questions posed to them. The representative of Morgan
Stanley also noted that Party A had indicated that it would need at least a couple of months before it could enter into a transaction with the
Company, while Party D and Party G had indicated that they could proceed on an expedited basis, so as a result Morgan Stanley could not
confirm that Party A's proposal was credible. A representative of Latham & Watkins then provided an overview of the form merger
agreement to be provided to potentially interested parties, including the structure of the transaction (a two-step acquisition of the Company
through a tender offer, followed by a merger) and the deal protection provisions (including the no solicitation covenant, the "fiduciary out"
provisions and the termination provisions). After discussion with, and input, from representatives of each of Morgan Stanley and
Latham & Watkins, the Company Board determined to include a "go shop" provision in the form merger agreement to be provided to the
potentially interested parties. The Company Board also instructed Morgan Stanley (a) to continue discussions with Party D and Party G to
encourage them to improve their respective

indications of interest, (b) to continue its analysis of Party A's proposal and present its conclusions to the Company Board, (c) to continue
discussions with all other interested parties that had expressed an interest in a potential acquisition of the Company to confirm whether
they would submit an indication of interest and (d) to provide each of the interested parties that submitted a proposal with the form merger
agreement. The Company Board also noted that some of the potentially interested parties could require management to continue
employment with the Company after closing, and Party D's indication of interest expressly stated so. The Company Board requested
management to confirm that they would not discuss compensation arrangements with any potentially interested party until later in the sale
process after such discussions had been consented to by the Company Board. Management confirmed that they would comply with this
request.

        On December 12, 2016, Party A requested the Company's consent to enter into discussions with Party F for it to serve as a potential
financing source for Party A's proposal to acquire the Company. Morgan Stanley previously had contacted Party F as a potential interested
party in connection with the sale process, but Party F had indicated that it was not interested in an acquisition of the Company.

        On December 12, 2016, members of management and representatives of Party G held a due diligence session.

        On December 19, 2016, members of management and representatives of Party D held a due diligence session.

        On December 19, 2016, representatives of Party G met with and had dinner with Mr. Dennis and a representative of Morgan Stanley.

        On December 20, 2016, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by members of management, representatives of
Morgan Stanley and representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, a representative of Morgan Stanley provided an update on the
status of the sale process, including that, only Party D and Party G were still pursuing discussions with the Company concerning the
possible acquisition of the Company, that all other parties declined to pursue such discussions and that both Party D and Party G were
actively engaged in due diligence with the Company. He also discussed the status of Morgan Stanley's continued discussions with Party A
regarding its indication of interest, noted that the Company had provided Party A with additional information regarding the Company's
forecasts and noted that Party A had requested the Company's consent to enter into discussions with Party F, as a possible financing
source. Party F had previously signed a confidentiality agreement with the Company as a potential bidder, but had subsequently indicated
to Morgan Stanley that Party F would not submit a proposal to the Company and terminated discussions with the Company and Morgan
Stanley regarding the potential acquisition of the Company. The representative of Morgan Stanley noted that, with the M&A Committee's
approval, the Company had provided the requested consent to allow Party A to improve its proposal to acquire the Company. At the
meeting, the Company Board also discussed the timing for reaching out to Mr. McCreight with respect to a voting agreement in the event
that a potential acquirer requested one.

        On January 4, 2017, Party D communicated to Morgan Stanley that it was reducing its proposed purchase price from up to and above
$7.10 per share, to below $7 per share, citing Party D's belief that additional product investment in the Company would be required
following consummation of the potential acquisition.

        On January 7, 2017, Party A communicated to Morgan Stanley that it would not be able to meet the Company's timeline for
completing the potential transaction and that Party A would not provide further information regarding Party A's valuation, the proposed
purchase price or any other terms.

        On January 11, 2017, members of management of the Company and representatives of Party G held a due diligence session.

        On January 17, 2017, Morgan Stanley sent a second round bid letter to Party G with a bid deadline of January 24, 2017.

        On January 20, 2017, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by members of management, representatives of Morgan
Stanley and representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, a representative of Morgan Stanley provided an update on the status of
the sale process, including that Party G was the only remaining actively engaged party in the sale process. The representative of Morgan
Stanley noted further that Party D had lowered its proposed purchase price for the Company to below $7 per share, primarily due to Party
D's belief that additional product investment in the Company would be needed, and that Party A would not meet the Company's timeline
or provide further information regarding Party A's proposal. At the meeting, a representative of Latham & Watkins discussed a proposed
management neutrality policy, which, among other things, included provisions regarding confidentiality, neutrality and the avoidance of
employment discussions with potentially interested parties until authorized by the Company Board. A representative of Morgan Stanley
noted that Party G had shared its post-closing business model for the Company and had asked Mr. Dennis to provide his feedback on the
model. The Company Board discussed the request, and Mr. Dennis provided his feedback on the model noting that it contemplated lower
revenue growth and higher cost reductions than the financial model prepared by management. Following discussion, the Company Board
authorized Mr. Dennis to provide feedback to Party G, provided that a representative of Morgan Stanley was present during these
discussions and Mr. Dennis complied with the management neutrality policy. At the meeting, Morgan Stanley provided the Company
Board with information regarding its relationship with Party G and the fees Party G had paid Morgan Stanley in the preceding two years.
A representative of Morgan Stanley confirmed that none of the team members at Morgan Stanley involved in the potential transaction for
the Company were involved in the work Morgan Stanley had done for Party G. After discussion, the Company Board confirmed that
because, among other things, the amount of the fees was not a material portion of Morgan Stanley's revenue, there was no conflict of
interest that prevented Morgan Stanley from acting as a financial advisor. A representative of Latham & Watkins noted that the firm had
represented Party G in matters unrelated to the Company, and neither he nor others at the firm involved in the potential transaction had
represented Party G. The Company Board confirmed that such representation did not present a conflict of interest.

        On January 24, 2017, Party G delivered a revised proposal to the Company, with a purchase price of $5.60 per share. Party G
indicated that its reduced purchase price was due to, among other things, (a) its perceived risk that the Company's e-discovery revenue
could decline in the future, (b) its belief that it would have to invest additional capital into the Company to grow the security business and
(c) its belief that it might not be able to secure financing for the Company on acceptable terms following consummation of the potential
acquisition.

        On January 25, 2017, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by members of management, representatives of Morgan
Stanley and representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, a representative of Morgan Stanley provided an update on the status of
the sale process, noting specifically Party G's reduced offer price. The Company Board discussed the revised proposal and determined that
the reduced offer price was unacceptable and not in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company. The Company Board concluded
that management should cease work on the strategic alternatives review with respect to the sale process, and should instead focus their
efforts on the Company's operations as a stand-alone company.

        On February 8, 2017, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by members of management. At the meeting, the
Company Board discussed the 2017 operating plan for the Company and strategies for the business of the Company, including the
potential acquisition of Party E to provide scale to the Company's forensics business. The Company Board determined that an acquisition
of Party E would not be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders as Party E was a

direct competitor of the Company and a combination of the two businesses was not expected to result in a significant economic benefit or
synergies for the Company.

        On February 8, 2017, a representative of Morgan Stanley sent an email to a representative of Parent to reconnect on the Company. On
February 9, 2017, the representative of Morgan Stanley had a telephone conversation with the representative of Parent in which they
provided an update on the sale process and the Company's price expectations.

        On February 9, 2017, the M&A Committee held a meeting that was attended by other members of the Company Board and members
of management of the Company to debrief on the status of the sale process that had been concluded as a result of the failure to obtain a
proposal at a price that was deemed to be sufficient.

        On February 21, 2017, the Company delivered written notice to Morgan Stanley terminating the Morgan Stanley Engagement Letter
pursuant to its terms.

        On March 21, 2017, Mr. Dennis and a representative of Parent held a phone discussion regarding the status of the Company's sale
process and the strategic alternatives to a sale being considered by the Company Board.

        On April 20, 2017, Parent submitted a non-binding preliminary indication of interest to the Company proposing the acquisition of the
Company through a cash tender offer at $6.79 per share. Among other things, the indication of interest contemplated that key stockholders
of the Company would be required to enter into support agreements with Parent in connection with the proposed transaction. The
indication of interest stated that Parent's proposed acquisition would not be subject to any financing contingency. The indication of interest
included provisions, proposed to be binding on the Company, providing for an exclusive period of due diligence and negotiation from the
date thereof until May 23, 2017, to be automatically extended to May 30, 2017 if Parent continued good faith efforts to enter into a
transaction.

        On April 21, 2017, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by a member of management, representatives of Morgan
Stanley and representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, the Company Board discussed the Parent's indication of interest with
the representatives of Morgan Stanley and Latham & Watkins. After the discussion, the Company Board instructed Morgan Stanley to
inform Parent that Parent's proposed purchase price was inadequate and that Parent's requests for support agreements from key
stockholders and exclusivity were unacceptable at that time. The Company Board further instructed Morgan Stanley to relay to Parent that
Parent would be permitted to conduct further focused due diligence on the Company and that, if Parent increased its purchase price to an
acceptable level, the Company Board would consider granting Parent limited exclusivity to pursue a potential transaction. On the same
day, the Company and Morgan Stanley entered into a letter agreement reinstating the Morgan Stanley Engagement Letter from August 31,
2016.

        On April 21, 2017, a member of the corporate development team of Parent contacted Mr. Dennis regarding its interest in a potential
acquisition of the Company. Following this initial discussion, on April 23, 2017, Mr. Barrenechea also contacted Mr. Dennis concerning
Parent's interest in pursuing the potential acquisition of the Company.

        On April 24, 2017, representatives of Morgan Stanley and Parent discussed the Company Board's response to the indication of
interest. During the discussion, Morgan Stanley explained that the Company was unwilling to agree to a period of exclusive negotiations at
the offered price but was willing to engage in further negotiations. Rather than making a new proposal, the representatives of Parent
requested that the Company make a counterproposal. Parent also indicated that it would wait to review the results for the Company's first
quarter and the outcome of its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, scheduled for May 3, 2017.

        On April 25, 2017, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by a member of management, a representative of Morgan
Stanley and a representative of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, the representative from Morgan Stanley summarized the discussions
Morgan Stanley held with Parent management in which Morgan Stanley relayed the Company Board's view that Parent's proposed
purchase price was inadequate and that the Company could not obtain support agreements from key stockholders, who were outside of the
Company's control. The representative of Morgan Stanley noted that Parent requested a counterproposal from the Company Board. The
Company Board discussed the timing of a transaction with Parent and whether to engage Mr. McCreight regarding a support agreement, if
and when, there was an offer from Parent which the Company Board deemed acceptable. The Company Board determined that it would be
premature to have any discussions with Mr. McCreight at that time.

        On May 3, 2017, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by members of management, representatives of Morgan
Stanley and a representative of Latham & Watkins. During the meeting, a representative of Morgan Stanley provided an update on its
discussions with Parent and discussed its valuation analyses with the Company. Following a discussion of the valuation of the Company,
the Company Board directed Morgan Stanley to propose an all cash purchase price of $7.50 per share to Parent. The Company Board also
directed Morgan Stanley to send a draft Merger Agreement to Parent.

        On May 4, 2017, a representative of Morgan Stanley communicated the Company Board's proposal to Parent.

        On May 5, 2017, during a telephone conversation between representatives of Parent and Morgan Stanley, Parent representatives
expressed Parent's expectation for a period of exclusive negotiations between Parent and the Company, and Morgan Stanley responded that
the Company would require a "go-shop" right and an offer price of $7.50 per share in return and requested that Parent provide a mark-up
of the draft Merger Agreement and a due diligence work plan.

        On May 10, 2017, Morgan Stanley sent Parent a draft Merger Agreement which contemplated, among other things, (x) a 45-day "go-
shop" period during which the Company would be permitted to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties, (y) a termination
fee of 1.25% of the purchase price upon termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company to accept an alternative acquisition
proposal received during the "go-shop" period and a termination fee of 2.5% upon the occurrence of certain other events, including
termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company to accept an alternative acquisition proposal received after the "go-shop" period,
and (z) an obligation of Parent to take all actions necessary to obtain antitrust approval, including any divestitures required to close the
proposed merger.

        On May 15, 2017, a representative of Parent confirmed to Morgan Stanley that Parent would conduct targeted due diligence on the
Company and review the draft Merger Agreement that Morgan Stanley had delivered to Parent. Parent indicated that, following these
actions, it would then readdress its proposed purchase price of the Company based on the feedback received from the Company Board.

        On May 25, 2017, Parent sent Morgan Stanley an indicative work plan, a due diligence request list and proposed revisions to the draft
of the Merger Agreement. The revised draft did not specify Parent's proposed offer price.

        On May 31, 2017, a representative of Parent communicated to Morgan Stanley that it would require a discussion between the Chief
Executive Officers of Parent and the Company before it would be willing to proceed.

        On June 5, 2017, representatives of Parent and Morgan Stanley had a telephone conversation, in which they discussed, among other
things, volatility in the trading price of the Company's common stock and the Company Board's view on the Company's overall business.

        On June 16, 2017, Messrs. Dennis and Barrenechea held a discussion regarding Parent's proposal. On the same day, Parent
communicated to Morgan Stanley a revised proposal, including (a) a purchase price of $7.05 per share, (b) no requirement for support
agreements from significant stockholders of the Company (as opposed to the directors and certain officers of the Company), (c) a
termination fee equal to 3.55% of the purchase price in the Merger Agreement, and (d) that no "go-shop" provision would be included in
the Merger Agreement.

        On June 21, 2017, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by members of management, representatives of Morgan
Stanley and representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, a representative of Morgan Stanley discussed the Parent offer, including
the purchase price of $7.05 per share, the proposed termination fee equal to 3.55% of the purchase price and the fact that the Merger
Agreement would not include a go-shop provision. A representative of Latham & Watkins also summarized certain key terms of Parent's
mark-up of the Merger Agreement. The Company Board discussed Parent's markup of the Merger Agreement, including the number of
times Parent would be required to extend the tender offer, the treatment of equity awards, the governmental approvals covenants, the
indemnification of directors and officers provisions, the non-solicitation provisions, the termination provisions and the termination fee
provisions. The Company Board noted that the price per share proposed by Parent represented a relatively low premium to the recent
trading price of the Company's common stock. On June 20, 2017, the closing price of the Company's common stock on Nasdaq was $6.65
per share. The Company Board also discussed the various risks that the Company faced in the future, including capital constraints,
competition from companies with greater resources and the possibility that the Company would not be able to implement its business plan
due to various factors (many of which were outside of its control). The Company Board also noted that Mr. McCreight had indicated that
he would continue to sell his shares of the Company's common stock, which could depress the trading price of the shares. The Company
Board weighed these risks against the certainty of value that could be attained through an acquisition of the Company by Parent.
Following this discussion, the Company Board authorized Morgan Stanley to make a counterproposal to Parent with a purchase price of
$7.15 per share and a termination fee of 2.5% of the purchase price. However, the Company Board determined that it would be willing to
grant Parent exclusivity, so long as Parent agreed to increase its non-binding proposed purchase price to $7.10 per share and to decrease its
proposed termination fee to 2.5% of the purchase price. During the meeting, the Company Board held an executive session in which the
Company Board discussed Mr. Bish's role as chief executive officer of Kofax Limited ("Kofax"), which is a competitor of Parent.
Mr. Bish noted that Kofax does not conduct business that is similar to the Company's business and has no aspirations to do so, and
confirmed that he did not believe Kofax's status as a competitor of Parent would prevent him from objectively and faithfully discharging
his duties to the Company or its stockholders. Without Mr. Bish present, a representative of Latham & Watkins discussed the relevant legal
standards for considering whether a conflict of interest existed. Following discussion, the Company Board concluded that Mr. Bish did not
have a conflict of interest that would prevent him from discharging his duties to the Company and its stockholders.

        On June 22, 2017, Mr. Dennis provided Mr. Barrenechea feedback from the Company Board regarding Parent's proposed acquisition
of the Company, including a request for an offer price of $7.15 per share and other terms the Company would require in order to agree to a
period of exclusivity.

        On June 23, 2017, the Company received a non-binding preliminary indication of interest from Parent, which contemplated a
purchase of the Company through a public tender offer at a purchase price of $7.10 per share in cash and a termination fee equal to 2.5%
of the purchase price. The non-binding preliminary indication of interest contemplated an exclusivity period ending on July 28, 2017
(subject to a potential seven-day extension).

        On June 25, 2017, at the direction of the Company Board, Morgan Stanley sent a draft Exclusivity Agreement to Parent, which
contemplated an exclusivity period ending on July 24, 2017 (subject to a potential seven-day extension).

        On June 26, 2017, Parent sent its comments on the Exclusivity Agreement and a revised draft of the non-binding preliminary
indication of interest, proposing the acquisition of the Company through a stock tender offer at $7.10 per share and a termination fee of
2.5% of the equity value of the Company in the transaction. The revised draft of the non-binding preliminary indication of interest deleted
the exclusivity provisions (which were now covered by the separate Exclusivity Agreement). The revised Exclusivity Agreement provided
for an exclusivity period ending on July 28, 2017 (subject to a potential seven-day extension).

        On June 27, 2017, at the direction of the Company Board, Morgan Stanley informed Parent that the Company had agreed to proceed
with the negotiation of definitive documents on the terms proposed in Parent's June 26 indication of interest. On the same date, Parent and
the Company entered into the June 26 indication of interest and the Exclusivity Agreement, providing for an exclusivity period ending on
August 1, 2017.

        During the period from June 29, 2017 to July 25, 2017, representatives of Parent engaged with the Company and its financial advisors
for the purposes of Parent's due diligence.

        On July 3, 2017, Latham & Watkins sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel
to Parent ("Cleary Gottlieb").

        On July 5, 2017, representatives of Parent and the Company attended an informal dinner in Pasadena, California.

        On July 6 and 7, 2017, representatives of Parent and the Company held due diligence sessions at the Company's headquarters.

        On July 7, 2017, the Company Board held a meeting attended by members of management, a representative of Morgan Stanley and
representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, Mr. Dennis discussed the due diligence sessions that had occurred during the
previous two days. A representative of Latham & Watkins discussed key terms of the draft Merger Agreement it had sent to Cleary
Gottlieb. Among other things, the Company Board discussed the potential requirements for Parent to seek CFIUS Approval and DSS
Consent for the proposed transaction, and the impact this could have on timing and certainty of closing.

        On July 12, 2017, Cleary Gottlieb sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Latham & Watkins.

        On July 13, 2017, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by members of management, representatives of Morgan
Stanley and representatives of Latham & Watkins. At the meeting, a representative of Morgan Stanley provided an update on Parent's due
diligence. A representative of Latham & Watkins discussed the key terms of the revised draft of the Merger Agreement Cleary Gottlieb
had sent the previous day. The Company Board discussed the recent trading price of the Company's common stock, which had been above
the purchase price for the Company proposed acquisition by Parent. A representative of Latham & Watkins led the Company Board in a
discussion of the duties of a board of directors in connection with a possible sale of a company.

        Between July 17 and July 23, 2017, representatives of Latham & Watkins and Cleary Gottlieb held various conference calls to discuss
the Merger Agreement, the tender and support agreement and other transaction documents, and exchanged drafts of the foregoing
documents.

        On July 23, 2017, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by members of management, representatives of Morgan
Stanley, representatives of Latham & Watkins, a representative of Richards Layton and representatives of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher & Flom LLP, regulatory counsel to the Company ("Skadden"). At the meeting, a representative of Richards Layton led the
Company Board in a discussion of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board in the context of a sale of the Company. Representatives of
Latham & Watkins led the Company Board in a discussion of the key provisions of the Merger Agreement and public company litigation
issues and trends. A representative of Morgan Stanley made a presentation regarding Morgan Stanley's financial analyses for the proposed
transaction between Parent and the Company based on a purchase price of $7.10 per share. During this presentation, the Company Board
and representatives of Morgan Stanley discussed the October 2016 Management Projections (which had been provided to potentially
interested parties in connection with the sale process), the April 2017 Management Projections (which had been updated to reflect the
expected business performance of the Company) and the July 2017 Management Projections (which had been updated to reflect the
expected business performance of the Company and which the Company Board had directed Morgan Stanley to use for the purposes of its
financial analysis). Representatives of Skadden discussed the regulatory approvals that would be needed for the transaction, and the
regulatory approval covenants in the Merger Agreement. A representative of Latham & Watkins discussed the draft board and
compensation committee resolutions that the Company Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board could adopt if
they approved the transaction.

        On July 24, 2017, Latham & Watkins received a revised draft of the Merger Agreement from Cleary Gottlieb. Latham & Watkins sent
a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Cleary Gottlieb on the same day.

        On July 25, 2017, representatives of Latham & Watkins and Cleary Gottlieb discussed the Merger Agreement. On the same day,
Cleary Gottlieb sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Latham & Watkins.

        Also on July 25, 2017, the Company Board held a meeting that was attended by representatives of Morgan Stanley, representatives of
Latham & Watkins and a representative of Richards Layton. A representative of Latham & Watkins led the Company Board in a
discussion regarding the changes to the Merger Agreement since the previous meeting. A representative of Morgan Stanley discussed
financial analyses and rendered to the Company Board the oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date that, as of the
date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and
limitations on the scope of review set forth therein, the consideration to be received by the holders of Company Shares pursuant to the
Merger Agreement (other than (i) Parent, Purchaser or the Company, or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent,
Purchaser or the Company or (ii) any stockholder of the Company who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for its
shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with Section 262 of the DGCL) was fair, from a financial point of view to such
holders. The foregoing summary of Morgan Stanley's opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion attached
as Annex A to this Schedule 14D-9. The Company Board discussed with management the Company's expected results for the second
quarter which, based on management's current estimates, would be lower than that contemplated by stock analyst expectations. Following
the discussion, the Company Board unanimously (a) determined that the Merger Agreement, the Tender Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby were fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (b) approved and declared advisable the
Merger Agreement, the Tender Agreement and such transactions, including the tender offer and the merger, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions contained therein, (c) resolved that the merger would be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, and
(d) determined, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein (including Section 5.3 thereof) to recommend that the

stockholders of the Company accept the offer and tender their shares of Company Shares pursuant to the offer. The meeting of the
Company Board then adjourned and a meeting of the Compensation Committee of the Company Board convened. At the meeting, after
discussion, the Compensation Committee approved the compensation arrangements between the Company and its directors, officers and
employees for purposes of establishing the non-exclusive safe harbor with respect to such compensation arrangements pursuant to
Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

        Late in the evening on July 25, 2017, Parent and the Company entered into the Merger Agreement, and early in the morning on
July 26, 2017, the parties issued press releases announcing the transaction.

Reasons for the Company Board's Recommendation

        In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, and recommending that the Company's
stockholders accept the Offer and tender all of their Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company Board consulted with the
Company's senior management, Latham & Watkins and Morgan Stanley, and considered and analyzed a wide and complex range of
factors. The Company Board also consulted with Latham & Watkins and Richards Layton regarding the Company Board's fiduciary
duties, legal due diligence matters and the terms of the Merger Agreement and related agreements. Based on these consultations,
considerations and analyses, and the factors discussed below, the Company Board concluded that entering into the Merger Agreement with
Parent and Purchaser would yield the best value reasonably attainable for the Company's stockholders and is fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company's stockholders.

        The Company Board considered the following material factors and benefits in arriving at its resolution to enter into the Merger
Agreement and its recommendation to the holders of Company Shares. The following factors are not intended to be exhaustive and are not
presented in any relative order of importance:

• The exploration by the Company Board of the potential sale of the Company for a considerable period of time: 

• the Company Board's designation, in February 2016, of the M&A Committee to evaluate potential mergers,
acquisitions, other business combinations, joint ventures, corporate development opportunities, divestitures and
other potential key strategic transactions outside the ordinary course of the Company's business; 

• the Company's disclosure, in April 2016 in connection with the Settlement Agreement, that it would search for an
appropriate financial advisor to provide advice to the Company Board related to strategic alternatives and that, upon
retention of such financial advisor, the Company Board would consider strategic alternatives; and 

• the Company's engagement, in August 2016, of Morgan Stanley as its financial advisor to provide advice in the
process and over the course of 2016 and in 2017, the Company, with the assistance of Morgan Stanley, engaged in
discussions with numerous financial and strategic buyers to explore a strategic transaction relating to the sale of the
Company; 

• the belief that the proposed transaction with Parent would yield the best value reasonably attainable to the Company's
stockholders and is therefore more favorable to the Company's stockholders than the other strategic alternatives available to
the Company, including continuing to operate as an independent company and growing its business through internal
growth, which belief was formed based on the Company Board's review of risks associated with those alternatives;

Table of Contents

• the Company Board's assessment of the strategic alternatives available to the Company, including an evaluation of the
prospective timeframe and operating and market risks associated with undertaking acquisitions or other capital investments
to create additional stockholder value; 

• the Company Board's and management's understanding of the business, operations, financial condition, earnings,
competitive position, strategic options and prospects of the Company, as well as of the current and prospective environment
in which the Company operates, including economic and market conditions, and the potential impact of those factors on the
Company's stock price; 

• the fact that the all-cash Offer Price allows the Company's stockholders to immediately realize a fair value that is liquid and
certain, while avoiding potential long-term business risk, including risks that could prevent the Company from achieving
its profitability and cost savings goals; 

• the proposed form of the Merger Agreement with Parent and Purchaser was arrived at after a rigorous auction and
negotiation process, during which 33 potential buyers were approached by Morgan Stanley, of which 13 executed
confidentiality agreements and two submitted formal bids, and during which Party A made an unsolicited proposal to the
Company before formal bids were submitted in the auction process; 

• the Company Board's consideration of several proposals other than the proposal from Parent, and its conclusion, after
considering the potential benefits and risks to the Company and its stockholders associated with each of those proposals,
that the best available alternative for Company stockholders is a sale of the Company to Parent; 

• the current and foreseeable market conditions, including the risks and uncertainties in the U.S. and global economy
generally, and the cyber-security industry specifically; 

• general stock market conditions and volatility, including the performance of broad-based stock market indices and
exchanges; 

• the fact that the fixed Offer Price will not fluctuate as a result of changes in the price of the Company Shares, which limits
the impact of external factors on the transaction; 

• the opinion of Morgan Stanley, to the Company Board, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and
subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope
of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders
of Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement (other than (i) Parent, Purchaser or the Company, or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, Purchaser or the Company or (ii) any stockholder of the Company who is
entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for its shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL) was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The foregoing summary of Morgan
Stanley's opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion attached as Annex A to this
Schedule 14D-9; 

• the careful review of the provisions of the Merger Agreement, and the preparation of the Company's disclosure schedules,
by the Company's management team and Latham & Watkins; 

• the fact that the structure of the transaction as a two-step transaction potentially enables the Company's stockholders to
receive the offer price pursuant to the Offer in a relatively short time frame (and potentially reduces the uncertainty during
the pendency of the transaction);

Table of Contents

• the commitment of both parties to complete the Offer and the Merger pursuant to their respective obligations under the
terms of the Merger Agreement, and the likelihood that Parent will complete the Offer and the Merger based on, among
other things: 

• the fact that there is no financing or due diligence condition to the completion of the Offer and the Merger; and 

• the fact that the number of extensions to the Offer required under the Merger Agreement and outside date under the
Merger Agreement are expected to allow for sufficient time to complete the Offer and the Merger; 

• the provisions of the proposed form of Merger Agreement that provide the Company with the necessary flexibility to
operate its business in the ordinary course and to address reasonably anticipated challenges that may arise during the
pendency of the Merger; 

• the provisions of the proposed form of Merger Agreement permitting the Company, under certain circumstances and
subject to procedural requirements, to furnish information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries to, a third party that
makes an bona fide unsolicited written Competing Proposal, to engage in discussions or negotiations with such third party
with respect to such Competing Proposal, provided that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and based on the information then available, that such Competing
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; 

• the fact that the termination fee of $6,014,095.55 (representing 2.5% of the aggregate purchase price) payable by the
Company in certain circumstances was viewed by the Company Board, after consultation with the Company's legal and
financial advisors, as reasonable and not likely to preclude any other party from making a Competing Proposal, and was
necessary as part of the deal protection provisions in light of the significant resources that Parent has committed to the
transaction; 

• the fact that the stockholders that do not tender their Company Shares in the Offer and who properly exercise their
appraisal rights under Delaware law will be entitled to such appraisal rights in connection with the Merger; and 

• the business reputation, management and financial resources of Parent which supported the Company Board's conclusion
that a transaction with Parent and Purchaser could be completed relatively quickly and in an orderly manner.

        The Company Board also considered the following potentially negative factors in its consideration of the Merger Agreement, the
Tender Agreement and the Transactions:

• the risk that certain conditions to the Offer may not be satisfied by the outside date under the Merger Agreement, including
as a result of the failure to satisfy the Regulatory Conditions and the Minimum Condition; 

• the risk that the public announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement could affect the Company's business,
operations, stock price, and employees and the Company's ability to retain key employees, the Company's ability to
effectively recruit replacement personnel if key personnel were to depart while the Merger is pending, and the potential
adverse effects on the Company's financial results as a result of any related disruption in its business (including, a potential
loss of customers, suppliers or business partners); 

• the fact that the Offer Price and Merger Consideration and cancellation of the Company Shares upon completion of the
Merger precludes Company stockholders from having the opportunity to participate in the future performance of the
Company's business and to realize any potential

Company's stockholders generally; 

• the risk that the Transactions could subject the Company to litigation; 

• the trading price of the Company Shares could be adversely affected;

• the substantial costs to be incurred in connection with the Transactions, including the transaction expenses arising from the
Offer and the Merger and payments to the external advisors of the Company; 

• the risk that failure to complete the Offer or the Merger could negatively affect the price of Company Shares, the operating
results of the Company, particularly in light of the costs incurred in connection with the Transactions, and the Company's
ability to attract and retain customers and personnel and finance its operations; and 

• the termination fee to be paid to Parent if the Merger Agreement is terminated under circumstances specified in the
proposed form of Merger Agreement, which may discourage other parties that would otherwise have an interest in
acquiring the Company.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Company Board is intended to be illustrative and not
exhaustive, but includes the material reasons and factors considered by the Company Board in reaching its conclusions and
recommendation in relation to the Merger Agreement, the Tender Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions. In view of
the wide variety of reasons and factors considered and the complexity of these matters, the Company Board did not find it practical to, and
did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specified factors considered in reaching their determinations or the reasons for
such determinations. Individual directors may have given differing weights to different factors or may have had different reasons for their
ultimate determination. In addition, the Company Board did not reach any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons
considered. Instead, the Company Board conducted an overall analysis of the factors and reasons described above and determined in its
business judgment that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits of the Offer and the Merger to the stockholders of the Company outweighed
the risks or potential negative consequences.

Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor

        Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley") was retained by the Company Board to act as its financial advisor in connection
with the possible sale of the Company. The Company Board selected Morgan Stanley to act as the Company's financial advisor based on
Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise, reputation, its knowledge of and involvement in recent transactions in the software industry,
and its knowledge and understanding of the Company's business and affairs. On July 25, 2017, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion,
which was subsequently confirmed in writing on the same date, to the Company Board to the effect that, as of such date, and based upon
and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written opinion, the consideration to be received by the holders of Company Shares
pursuant to the Merger Agreement (other than (i) Parent, Purchaser or the Company, or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, Purchaser or the Company or (ii) any stockholder of the Company who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal
for its shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL) was fair from a financial point of view
to such holders.

        The full text of Morgan Stanley's written opinion to the Company Board, dated July 25, 2017, which sets forth, among other
things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the
review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion, is attached as Annex A to this Schedule 14D-9 and is incorporated
by reference in this Schedule 14D-9 in its entirety. The following summary of Morgan Stanley's opinion is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of the opinion. You are encouraged to read Morgan Stanley's opinion, this section and the summary of
Morgan Stanley's opinion below carefully and in their entirety. Morgan Stanley's opinion is directed to the Company Board, in its
capacity as such, and addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration to be received by the holders of
Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement as of the date of the opinion and did not address any other aspects or
implications of the Offer or the Merger. Morgan Stanley's opinion was not intended to, and does not, constitute advice or a
recommendation to any holder of Company Shares as to whether any stockholder of the Company should tender its Company
Shares in the Offer or how such stockholder should vote or act at any stockholders' meeting that may be held in connection with
the Merger or with respect to any other matter.

        In connection with rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:

• reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company;

• participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Parent and their legal
advisors; 

• reviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents; and 

• performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley
deemed appropriate.

        In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness
of the information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to Morgan Stanley by the Company, and formed a
substantial basis for the opinion. With respect to the financial projections, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared
on bases reflecting the best then-currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company of the future financial
performance of the Company. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the Offer and the Merger will be consummated in accordance
with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including among
other things, that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to Morgan
Stanley. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and
consents required for the proposed Offer and Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a
material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Offer and Merger. Morgan Stanley noted that it
is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley noted that it is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters.
Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company's
officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be received by the holders of Company
Shares in the transaction. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company,
nor was Morgan Stanley furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion was necessarily based on financial,
economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, July 25, 2017. Events occurring after
such date may affect Morgan Stanley's opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any
obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

        In performing the financial analysis summarized below and arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley used and relied upon certain
financial projections provided by the Company's management and referred to in this Schedule 14D-9 (and defined in the following section
captioned "Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information of the Company") as the "July 2017 Management Projections," and
certain financial projections based on Wall Street research reports and referred to in this Schedule 14D-9 as the "Street Case." For more
information, please see the section of this Schedule 14D-9 captioned "Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information of the
Company."

Public Trading Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed a public trading comparables analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by
comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared publicly available consensus equity
analyst research estimates for the Company with comparable publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for certain
selected companies that are in the security software industry or are companies that share similar business characteristics such as those that
have certain comparable operating characteristics including, among other things, similarly sized revenue and/or revenue growth rates,
market capitalizations, profitability, scale and/or other similar operating characteristics that Morgan Stanley determined, upon the
application of its professional judgment and experience, to be similar to the Company (we refer to these companies as the comparable
companies). The companies used in this comparison included the following:

Security Companies:

• Absolute Software Corporation 

• Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. 

• F-Secure Corporation 

• FireEye, Inc. 

• Fortinet, Inc. 

• Imperva, Inc. 

• Qualys, Inc. 

• Symantec Corporation 

• VASCO Data Security International, Inc. 

• Zix Corporation

Small Capitalization Software Companies:

• Avid Technology, Inc. 

• Bazaarvoice, Inc. 

• Marin Software Incorporated 

• ServiceSource International, Inc.

        The above companies were chosen based on Morgan Stanley's knowledge of the industry and because they have businesses that may
be considered similar to the Company's. Although none of such companies are identical or directly comparable to the Company, these
companies are publicly traded companies with operations and/or other criteria, such as lines of business, markets, business risks,

growth prospects, maturity of business and size and scale of business, that Morgan Stanley considered similar to those of the Company for
purposes of its analysis.

        For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed:

• the ratio of aggregate value ("AV") (calculated as the market value of equity plus total debt, net of cash and cash
equivalents) to estimated revenue, which we refer to as AV / Revenue Ratio, for each of calendar year 2017 and calendar
year 2018; and 

• the ratio of AV to estimated EBITDA ("EBITDA") (calculated as net income excluding net interest expense, income tax
expense and certain other non-cash items, principally depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, and non-
recurring items), which we refer to as AV / EBITDA Ratio, for each of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018.

        Morgan Stanley also reviewed the historical AV / NTM Revenue Ratio for the Company over the twelve-month period ended July 25,
2017, where estimated revenue for purposes of calculating such ratio on any date in the period was estimated revenue for the four quarters
ending subsequent to such date, based on publicly available consensus equity analyst research estimates for the Company. The Company's
AV / NTM Revenue Ratio ranged from 1.3x to 2.1x during this period, and as of July 25, 2017 was 1.8x.

        Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the comparable companies and its review of relevant metrics for the
Company, including its review of the historical changes over the twelve-month period ended July 25, 2017 in the AV / NTM Revenue
Ratio for the Company described in the preceding paragraph, and upon the application of its professional judgment, Morgan Stanley
selected representative ranges of the AV / Revenue Ratio and the AV / EBITDA Ratio for each of the calendar years 2017 and 2018 and
applied these ranges of multiples to the relevant company financial statistics, utilizing publicly available estimates of revenue and
EBITDA prepared by equity research analysts, available as of July 25, 2017. Based on the outstanding Company Shares on a fully-diluted
basis as of June 30, 2017 provided by the Company's management, Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied value per Company
Share as of July 25, 2017 as follows:

        Morgan Stanley compared the foregoing range of implied present value per Company Share to (1) the closing price per share of
Company Shares of $6.90 on July 25, 2017, the last full trading day immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, and
(2) the cash consideration of $7.10 per share.

        No company included in the comparable public company analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating comparable companies,
Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial
conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of the Company. These include, among other things, the impact of competition
on the business of the Company and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the
financial condition and prospects of the Company and the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as
determining the mean or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable company data.

Discounted Equity Value Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed a discounted equity valuation analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the potential future equity
value of a company as a function of such company's estimated future financial performance. The resulting equity value is subsequently
discounted to arrive at an estimate of the implied present value of such company's equity value. In connection with this analysis, Morgan
Stanley calculated a range of implied present equity values per Company Share on a standalone basis. To calculate the discounted equity
value, Morgan Stanley used an estimate of net cash as of the end of the second quarter of calendar year 2019 and calendar year 2019
revenue and EBITDA estimates based on the July 2017 Management Projections. Morgan Stanley applied a range of forward multiples
(derived from the public trading analysis above and Morgan Stanley's application of its professional judgment and experience) to these
estimates and applied a discount rate of 9.9%, which rate was selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley's professional judgment
and experience, to reflect an estimate of the Company's cost of equity.

        Based on the outstanding Company Shares on a fully-diluted basis as of July 25, 2017 provided by the Company's management,
Morgan Stanley calculated the estimated implied present value per Company Share using the discounted equity valuation analysis as
follows:

        Morgan Stanley compared the foregoing ranges of implied present value per Company Share to (1) the closing price per Company
Share of $6.90 on July 25, 2017, the last full trading day immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, and (2) the cash
consideration of $7.10 per share.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of an asset using estimates
of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset, taking into consideration the time value of money with respect to those
future cash flows by calculating their "present value." The "unlevered free cash flows" refers to a calculation of the future cash flows
generated by an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. Specifically, "unlevered free cash flow" was defined
as EBITDA less (i) stock-based compensation, (ii) taxes, (iii) changes in net working capital and (iv) capital expenditures, as more fully
described in the following section captioned "Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information of the Company". "Present value"
refers to the current value of the future cash flows generated by the asset, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the
present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital and
other appropriate factors. "Terminal value" refers to the present value of all future cash flows generated by the asset for periods beyond the
projections period.

        Morgan Stanley used estimates from the July 2017 Management Projections and extrapolations from the July 2017 Management
Projections for purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, as more fully described below. Morgan Stanley calculated the present value
of estimated unlevered free cash flows for the Company for the period from the third quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2017
and each of the calendar years 2018 through 2024. Morgan Stanley also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company by applying
a perpetual growth rate ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% to the estimated unlevered free cash flows of the Company after the year 2024. Morgan
Stanley selected this perpetual growth rate range based on the application of Morgan Stanley's professional judgment and experience. The
estimated unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values at July 25, 2017 using a range
of discount rates from 8.9% to 10.9%, which range of discount rates were selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley's professional
judgment and experience, to reflect the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital.

        This analysis indicated the following range of implied present value per Company Share.

        Morgan Stanley compared the foregoing range of implied present value per Company Share to (1) the closing price per Company
Share of $6.90 on July 25, 2017, the last full trading day immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, and (2) the cash
consideration of $7.10 per share.

Precedent Transactions Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly
available financial terms and premia of selected transactions that share some characteristics with the merger.

between January 1, 2011 and July 25, 2017, with a publicly announced transaction value of between $250 million and $750 million based
on publicly available information. Morgan Stanley reviewed the premium paid in each transaction to the target company's (i) closing stock
price one trading day prior to the announcement of the transaction (or the last trading day prior to the share price being affected by
acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news), which is referred to below as the "One Day Spot Premium," (ii) average closing stock
price during the 30 trading days prior to the announcement of the transaction (or the last trading day prior to the share price being affected
by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news), which is referred to below as the "30 Day Average Premium," and (iii) high closing
stock price during the 52-week period prior to the announcement of the transaction (or the last trading day prior to the share price being
affected by acquisition rumors or similar merger-related news), which is referred to below as the "LTM High Premium."

        This analysis indicated the following:

        Based on the review of the premia paid in the transactions summarized above and the application of its professional judgment and
experience, Morgan Stanley applied the following premia ranges to the applicable price per Company Share for the specified time periods
(based on closing stock prices on and through July 25, 2017, the last full trading day immediately prior to the execution of the Merger
Agreement) to calculate a range of implied values per Company Share as follows:

        Morgan Stanley compared the foregoing range of implied present value per Company Share to (1) the closing price per Company
Share of $6.90 on July 25, 2017, the last full trading day immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, and (2) the cash
consideration of $7.10 per share.

        No company or transaction utilized in the precedent transaction multiples or premia paid analyses is identical to the Company or the
Offer and the Merger. In evaluating the precedent transactions, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, general business, market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of the Company. These
include, among other things, the impact of competition on the business of the Company and the industry generally, industry growth, and
the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company and the industry, and in the financial
markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as determining the mean or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using
comparable transaction data.

Other Information

Historical Trading Range

        For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley reviewed the low and high per share trading range
of Company Shares for the one year period ending on July 25, 2017, the last full trading day immediately prior to the execution of the
Merger Agreement, which was $4.93 to $7.60, and compared that to (1) the closing price per Company Share of $6.90 on July 25, 2017,
the last full trading day immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, and (2) the cash consideration of $7.10 per share.

Equity Research Analysts' Price Targets

        For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, Morgan Stanley also reviewed certain publicly available equity
research analyst share price targets for Company Shares and noted that (1) the undiscounted range of such price targets was $8.00 per
share to $10.00 per share and (2) the range of such price targets, discounted one year to present value using a 9.9% discount rate, which
rate was selected, upon the application of Morgan Stanley's professional judgment and experience, to reflect an estimate of the Company's
cost of equity, was $7.28 per share to $9.10 per share, and compared that to (1) the closing price per Company Share of $6.90 on July 25,
2017, the last full trading day immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, and (2) the cash consideration of $7.10 per
share.

General

        In connection with the review of the Offer and the Merger by the Company Board, Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial
and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all
of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that
selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole, would create an incomplete view of the process
underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than
other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the
ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual
value of the Company.

        In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business,
regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of the Company. These include,
among other things, the impact of competition on the business of the Company and the industry generally, industry growth, and the
absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition and prospects of the Company and

the industry, and in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's analyses are not necessarily indicative of
future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates.

        Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of
the consideration to be received by the holders of Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and in connection with the delivery
of its opinion to the Company Board. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which Company Shares
might actually trade.

        The consideration to be received by the holders of Company Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement was determined through
arm's-length negotiations between the Company and Parent and was approved by the Company Board. Morgan Stanley acted as financial
advisor to the Company Board during these negotiations but did not, however, recommend any specific consideration to the Company or
the Company Board, nor opine that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Offer and the Merger.
In addition, Morgan Stanley's opinion did not address the relative merits of the Offer and the Merger as compared to any other alternative
business transactions, or whether or not such alternative business transactions, and Morgan Stanley's opinion expressed no opinion or
recommendation as to whether the stockholders of the Company should tender their Company Shares into the Offer, or how to act or vote
at any stockholders' meeting that may be held in connection with the Merger or with respect to any other matter.

        Morgan Stanley's opinion and its presentation to the Company Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the
Company Board in deciding to approve the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement. Consequently,
the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Company Board with respect to the
consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement or of whether our Company Board would have been willing to agree to different
consideration. Morgan Stanley's opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in
accordance with its customary practice.

        The Company Board retained Morgan Stanley based on Morgan Stanley's qualifications, experience and expertise and its familiarity
with the Company. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual
wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign
exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial
advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that
invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account
or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the Parent, the Company, or any other company, or any currency or
commodity, that may be involved in the Offer and the Merger, or any related derivative instrument.

        Under the terms of the Morgan Stanley Engagement Letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Company financial advisory services and a
financial opinion, described in this section and attached to this Schedule 14D-9 as Annex A, in connection with the Offer and the Merger,
and the Company has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $5 million for its services, approximately $1 million of which
is contingent upon the closing of the Merger, and $4 million of which was due and payable upon the execution of the Merger Agreement.
The Company has also agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its reasonable expenses, including fees of outside counsel and other
professional advisors, incurred in connection with its engagement. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and
its affiliates, its and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each other person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or
any of its affiliates, against

certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, relating to, arising out of or in connection
with Morgan Stanley's engagement.

        In the two years prior to the date of its opinion, other than pursuant to the Morgan Stanley Engagement Letter, Morgan Stanley had
not provided financial advisory or financing services and had not received any fees for such services from the Company. In the two years
prior to the date of its opinion, Morgan Stanley had provided financing services for the Parent and received aggregate fees of
approximately $1 million in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may seek to provide financial advisory or financing services to
the Company, Parent and each of their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these
services.

Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information of the Company

Management Projections

        In connection with the commencement of the sale process involving the Company and in order to assist the Company Board in
evaluating potential strategic alternatives for the Company, the Company's management prepared, and the Company Board reviewed, a
forecast of the Company's financial information prepared in October 2016 (the "October 2016 Management Projections"). In April
2017, the Company's management updated the October 2016 Management Projections in order to provide the Company Board with its
current view of the future financial performance of the Company, which incorporated the most current market data and reflected changes
since October 2016 (the "April 2017 Management Projections"). In July 2017, the Company's management updated the April 2017
Projections in order to provide the Company Board with its current view of the future financial performance of the Company (the "July
2017 Management Projections", and together with the October 2016 Management Projections and the April 2017 Management
Projections, collectively, the "Management Projections"). The July 2017 Management Projections were made available to Parent in
connection with its due diligence review of the Company and the management of the Company directed Morgan Stanley to use the July
2017 Management Projections in connection with its financial analyses and in rendering its opinion.

        The Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts as to future financial performance, earnings or other results,
and is especially cautious of making forecasts for extended periods due to the inherent unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying
assumptions and estimates. As a result, the Company does not endorse the unaudited prospective financial information described herein as
a reliable indication of the results it may achieve on a stand-alone basis in the future.

        A summary of the Management Projections is not being included in this document to influence your decision whether to tender your
Company Shares in the Offer, but solely because these Management Projections were among the financial information made available to
Parent and to Morgan Stanley for use in connection with its financial analyses and opinion summarized above under "—Opinion of the
Company's Financial Advisor".

        The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. While presented with numerical specificity, the
Management Projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to matters such as industry performance and
competition, general business, economic and geopolitical conditions and additional matters specific to the Company's business, all of
which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company's control. The Management Projections reflect subjective
judgment in many respects and thus are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and
business developments. The Management Projections were, in general, prepared for internal use and are subjective in many respects. As a
result, there can be no assurance that the prospective results will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower
than estimated. Since the Management

Table of Contents

Projections cover multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. In addition, the
Management Projections will be affected by the Company's ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable
periods and reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. The Management Projections cannot, therefore,
be considered a guarantee of future operating results, and this information should not be relied on as such. The inclusion of the
Management Projections should not be regarded as an indication that the Company Board, the Company, Morgan Stanley or anyone who
received this information then considered, or now considers, them to be material information about the Company or a reliable prediction of
future events, and this information should not be relied upon as such. The Company's stockholders are urged to review the Company's
most recent SEC filings for a description of risk factors with respect to the Company's business. See Item 8 under the heading "Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

        The Management Projections were not prepared with a view toward complying with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the guidelines established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither the Company's independent
registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with
respect to the Management Projections contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such
information or its achievability. The report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm contained in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to the Company's historical financial information. It does not
extend to the Management Projections and should not be read to do so. Furthermore, the Management Projections do not take into account
any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared. Further, the Management Projections do not take into account the
effect of the Offer or the Merger, or any failure of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

        When viewed with the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and accompanying reconciliations, the
Company believes the non-GAAP measure of "Adjusted EBITDA" provides additional useful information to clarify and enhance the
understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's past performance and future prospects. Adjusted EBITDA as presented in
this Schedule 14D-9, is a supplemental measure of the Company's performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with,
GAAP. It is not a measurement of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net
income, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating
activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be interpreted to mean that the
Company's future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

        The Company Board's and executive management use Adjusted EBITDA internally as a complementary financial measure to
evaluate the performance and trends of the Company's business. Adjusted EBITDA is presented below because the Company believes that
measures such as these provide useful information with respect to the Company's ability to meet its future debt service, capital
expenditures, working capital requirements and overall operating performance.

Table of Contents

        Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tools, which should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of
the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's cash expenditures, future expenditures for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments; 

• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; 

• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on the Company's debt; 

• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to
be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 

• Adjusted EBITDA does not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Company's statement
of cash flows; 

• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact on earnings of charges resulting from matters unrelated to the Company's
ongoing operations; and 

• Other companies in the Company's industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting its usefulness as a
comparative measure.

        Such limitations should be compensated by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and Adjusted EBITDA should be used
only as a supplement to this information. See the Company's consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference into this Schedule 14D-9.

        However, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating the Company's results of operations
because this measure:

• is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items excluded from the
calculation of such terms, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods
and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors; 

• helps investors evaluate and compare the results of the Company's operations from period to period by removing the effect
of its capital structure from its operating performance; and 

• is used by the Company's management team for various other purposes in presentations to the Company Board as a basis
for strategic planning and forecasting.

Definition of Adjusted EBITDA

        Adjusted EBITDA, as used by the Company in this Schedule 14D-9, means net income, plus income tax expense, depreciation and
amortization, stock-based compensation and net interest expense.

Unlevered Free Cash Flow

        Morgan Stanley used financial estimates prepared by the Company's management from the July 2017 Management Projections to
derive estimates of unlevered free cash flow, which estimates were reviewed and approved by management. Unlevered free cash flow, as
used in this Schedule 14D-9, means Adjusted EBITDA less stock-based compensation, income tax expense, changes in net working
capital and capital expenditures.

        Set forth below is a summary of a reconciliation of unlevered free cash flow to Adjusted EBITDA based on financial information
available to, or projected by, the Company.

        Neither the Company, Morgan Stanley nor any other person to whom the Management Projections were provided or any of their
respective affiliates or representatives makes any representation to any person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company

in the Management Projections, the Company's stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the Management
Projections.

Item 5.    Persons/Assets Retained, Employed, Compensated Or Used 

        The Company's engagement and compensation of Morgan Stanley in connection with that firm's engagement to render an opinion to
the Company's Board regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the compensation to be received by the holders of Company
Shares in the Transactions, are described in Item 4, under the heading "Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor—Miscellaneous".
Additionally, the Company engaged Atlas Technology Group ("Atlas") as its non-exclusive financial advisor in connection with the
Company Board's evaluation of strategic alternatives. The Company has agreed to pay Atlas a fee of approximately $500,000 for its
services, which is contingent upon the closing of the Transactions, and to reimburse Atlas for its reasonable and documented fees,
expenses and disbursements.

        Except as otherwise described above, neither the Company nor any person acting on its behalf has employed, retained or
compensated any person to make solicitations or recommendations to its stockholders on its behalf concerning the Offer or the Merger,
except that such solicitations or recommendations may be made by directors, officers or employees of the Company, for which services no
additional compensation will be paid.

Item 6.    Interest In Securities Of The Subject Company 

        With the exception of the execution of the Merger Agreement and the Tender Agreement, no transactions with respect to Company
Shares have been effected by the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company after making reasonable inquiry, by any of its executive
officers, directors, affiliates or subsidiaries during the 60 days prior to the date of this Schedule 14D-9.

Item 7.    Purposes Of The Transaction And Plans Or Proposals 

        Except as set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 or as incorporated in this Schedule 14D-9 by reference, the Company is not undertaking or
engaged in any negotiations in response to the Offer that relate to:

• a tender offer or other acquisition of the Company's securities by the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any
other person; 

• any extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company; 

• any purchase, sale or transfer of a material amount of assets by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company; or 

• any material change in the present dividend rate or policy, or indebtedness or capitalization of the Company.

        Except as set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 or as incorporated in this Schedule 14D-9 by reference, there are no transactions,
resolutions of the Company Board, agreements in principle or signed contracts entered into in response to the Offer that relate to, or would
result in, one or more of the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph.

Item 8.    Additional Information 

Stockholder Approval Not Required.

        Section 251(h) of the DGCL provides that following consummation of a successful tender offer for a public corporation, and subject
to certain statutory provisions, if the acquiror holds at least the amount of shares of each class of stock of the acquired corporation that
would otherwise be required to approve a merger of the acquired corporation, and the stockholders that did not tender their shares in the
tender offer receive the same consideration for their stock in the merger as was payable in the

tender offer, the acquiror can effect a merger without the action of the stockholders of the acquired corporation. Accordingly, if Purchaser
consummates the Offer, the Merger Agreement contemplates that the parties will effect the closing of the Merger without a vote of the
stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If the Merger is effected, (a) Company stockholders who
do not tender their Company Shares in the Offer and who otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will be
entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law and (b) Company stockholders (other than Purchaser, Parent, the Company and each of
their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) who do not validly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law will receive the same cash
consideration for their Company Shares as was payable in the Offer following the consummation of the Merger.

Appraisal Rights

        Holders of Company Shares will not have appraisal rights in connection with the Offer. However, if Purchaser purchases Company
Shares in the Offer, and the Merger is consummated, holders of Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time will be entitled
to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, provided they comply with the applicable statutory procedures under Section 262.
Holders whose Company Shares are tendered pursuant to the Offer will not be entitled to appraisal rights.

        The following discussion summarizes appraisal rights of stockholders under the DGCL in connection with the Merger
assuming that the Merger is consummated pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text
of Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached to this Schedule 14D-9 as Annex B. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL and
in this summary to a "stockholder" or "holder" are to the record holder of Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective
Time as to which appraisal rights are demanded. A person having a beneficial interest in Company Shares held of record in the
name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps
summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. Stockholders should carefully review the full text
of Section 262 of the DGCL as well as the information discussed below.

        Under the DGCL, if the Merger is completed, holders of Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time and who (i) did not
tender their Company Shares in the Offer, (ii) follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and (iii) do not thereafter
withdraw their demand for appraisal of such Company Shares or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the
DGCL, will be entitled to have their Company Shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the
"fair value" of such shares, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
a rate of interest, if any, as determined by such court on the amount determined to be the fair value (or, in certain circumstances described
below, on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation to each
stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding). The "fair value" as so determined by the court
could be greater than, less than or the same as the Offer Price.

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger is approved under Section 251(h), either a constituent corporation before the
effective date of the merger, or the surviving corporation within 10 days thereafter, shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of
stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal
rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a
copy of Section 262. This Schedule 14D-9 constitutes the formal notice of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. Any holder of
Company Shares who wishes to exercise such appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so, should

review the following discussion and Annex B carefully because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures specified will
result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.

        Any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is urged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise such rights.

        If a stockholder elects to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and the Merger is consummated pursuant to
Section 251(h) of the DGCL, such stockholder must do all of the following:

• within the later of the consummation of the Offer and 20 days after the date of mailing of this Schedule 14D-9 (which date
of mailing is August 9, 2017), mail or otherwise transmit to the Company at the address indicated below a written demand
for appraisal of Company Shares held, which demand must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder is demanding appraisal; 

• not tender such stockholder's Company Shares in the Offer; 

• continuously hold of record such Company Shares from the date on which the written demand for appraisal is made
through the Effective Time; and 

• any stockholder (or beneficial owner of Company Shares) who has otherwise perfected his, her or its appraisal rights or the
Surviving Corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value
of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after the Effective Time.

        Notwithstanding a stockholder's compliance with foregoing requirements, the Court of Chancery shall dismiss the appraisal
proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, and such stockholders will effectively lose their appraisal
rights, unless (a) the total number of Company Shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding Company Shares eligible
for appraisal or (b) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of Company Shares entitled to appraisal
rights exceeds $1 million.

        If the Merger is consummated pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to deliver an
additional notice of the effective date of the Merger to all stockholders of the Company who delivered a written demand to the Company
(in accordance with the first bullet above) within 10 days after the closing of the Merger, as required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL.
However, only stockholders who have delivered a written demand in accordance with the first bullet above will receive such notice of the
effective date. If the Merger is consummated pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL, a failure to deliver a written demand for appraisal
in accordance with the time periods specified in the first bullet above (or to take any of the other steps specified in the above bullets or
summarized below) will be deemed to be a waiver or a termination of your appraisal rights.

Written Demand by the Record Holder

        All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Guidance Software Inc., 1055 E. Colorado Boulevard Pasadena, California
91106-237, Attention: Corporate Secretary. The written demand for appraisal must be executed by or for the record holder of Company
Shares and must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder of record and that such stockholder intends thereby to
demand appraisal of his, her or its Company Shares. If the Company Shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a
trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of the demand must be made in that capacity, and if the Company Shares are owned of record by
more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or for all joint owners. An
authorized agent, including one of two or more joint owners,

Table of Contents

may execute the demand for appraisal for a holder of record. However, the agent must identify the record owner(s) and expressly disclose
the fact that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner(s).

        A beneficial owner of Company Shares held in "street name" who wishes to exercise appraisal rights should take such actions as may
be necessary to ensure that a timely and proper demand for appraisal is made by the record holder of the Company Shares. If Company
Shares are held through a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee who in turn holds the Company Shares through a central securities
depository nominee, a demand for appraisal of such Company Shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee, and must
identify the depository nominee as the record holder. Any beneficial owner who wishes to exercise appraisal rights and holds Company
Shares through a nominee holder is responsible for ensuring that the demand for appraisal is timely made by the record holder. The
beneficial holder of the Company Shares should instruct the nominee holder that the demand for appraisal should be made by the record
holder of the Company Shares, which may be a central securities depository nominee if the Company Shares have been so deposited.

        A record holder, such as a broker, bank, fiduciary, depository or other nominee, who holds Company Shares as a nominee for several
beneficial owners may exercise appraisal rights with respect to the Company Shares held for one or more beneficial owners while not
exercising such rights with respect to the Company Shares held for other beneficial owners. In such case, the written demand must set
forth the number of Company Shares covered by the demand. Where the number of Company Shares is not expressly stated, the demand
will be presumed to cover all Company Shares held in the name of the record owner.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

        Within 120 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or any holder of Company Shares who has complied with
Section 262 of the DGCL and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262, or the beneficial owner of any such shares, may commence
an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the
Company Shares held by all holders who did not tender their shares in the Offer and who timely and properly demanded appraisal. If no
such petition is filed within that 120-day period, appraisal rights will be lost for all holders of Company Shares who had previously
demanded appraisal of their Company Shares. The Company is under no obligation to and has no present intention to file a petition, and
holders should not assume that the Company will file a petition or that it will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the
Company Shares. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the holders of Company Shares to initiate all necessary action to perfect their
appraisal rights in respect of the Company Shares within the period prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

        Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of Company Shares who has complied with the requirements for exercise of
appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate
number of Company Shares not voted in favor of the Merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate number of holders of such Company Shares. Such statement must be mailed within 10 days after a written request therefor has
been received by the Surviving Corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal,
whichever is later. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement that a demand for appraisal must be made by or on behalf of the record
owner of the Company Shares, a person who is the beneficial owner of Company Shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person, and as to which demand has been properly made and not effectively withdrawn, may, in such person's own name,
file a petition for appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.

Table of Contents

        Upon the filing of such petition by any such holder of Company Shares, service of a copy thereof must be made upon the Surviving
Corporation, which will then be obligated within 20 days to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list (the "Verified
List") containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their Company Shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their Company Shares have not been reached. Upon the filing of any such petition, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing on the petition be mailed to the Surviving Corporation and all of
the stockholders shown on the Verified List. Such notice will also be published at least one week before the day of the hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, or in another publication determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery. The costs of these notices are borne by the Surviving Corporation.

        After notice to the stockholders as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a
hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment for their Company Shares to
submit their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceeding and,
if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder.
Notwithstanding a stockholder's compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, the Court of Chancery shall dismiss the
proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of Company Shares entitled to
appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding Company Shares eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the
Merger for such total number of Company Shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds $1 million.

Determination of Fair Value

        After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which stockholders are entitled to appraisal, the appraisal proceeding will be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
Through such proceeding, the Court of Chancery will determine the fair value of the Company Shares, exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be
the fair value (or, in certain circumstances described below, on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the
amount paid by the Surviving Corporation to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal
proceeding). Unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the Effective Time
through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the
judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the Surviving Corporation may pay
to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the Company Shares
as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. The Company, Purchaser and Parent have made
no determination as to whether such a payment may be made if the Merger is consummated, and the Company reserves the right to make
such a payment upon the consummation of the Merger.

        In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that
"proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and

51

otherwise admissible in court" should be considered, and that "fair price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving
the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the Court of Chancery must
consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained
as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair
value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v.
Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion that does not encompass known elements
of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In
Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are
known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered."

        Stockholders considering appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their Company Shares as so determined could be more than,
the same as or less than the Offer Price and that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
consideration payable in a sale transaction, such as the Offer and the Merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, "fair
value" under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although the Company believes that the Offer Price is fair, no representation is made as to the
outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an
appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Offer Price. Neither Parent nor the Company
anticipates offering more than the Offer Price to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and they reserve the right to assert, in any
appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the fair value of a Company Share is less than the Offer Price.

        Upon application by the Surviving Corporation or by any holder of Company Shares entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of
the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any holder of Company Shares whose name appears on the Verified List and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Delaware Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings
until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights. The Court of Chancery will direct the payment of the
fair value of the Company Shares, together with interest, if any, on the amount determined to be the fair value (or, in certain circumstances
described herein on the difference between the amount determined to be the fair value and the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation
to each stockholder entitled to appraisal prior to the entry of judgment in the appraisal proceeding), by the Surviving Corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment will be so made to each such stockholder upon the surrender to the Surviving Corporation of such
stockholder's certificates. The Court of Chancery's decree may be enforced as other decrees in such Court may be enforced.

        If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if both (a) the total number of Company Shares entitled to appraisal rights does not
exceed 1% of the outstanding Company Shares eligible for appraisal and (b) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such
total number of Company Shares entitled to appraisal rights does not exceed $1 million, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs
of the action (which do not include attorneys' fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems equitable. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery
may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal proceeding, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the
Company Shares entitled to appraisal. In the absence of such determination or assessment, each party bears its own expenses.

Table of Contents

        Any stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after
the Effective Time, be entitled to vote his or her Company Shares for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or other
distributions thereon, except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of Company Shares as of a date prior to the
Effective Time.

        If any stockholder who demands appraisal of Company Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully
withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal, such stockholder's Company Shares will be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger (which is equal to the Offer Price, without
interest). A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, the stockholder's right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within
120 days after the Effective Time. Moreover, the Court of Chancery shall dismiss the proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights, and such stockholders will effectively lose their appraisal rights, unless either (a) the total number of Company
Shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds 1% of the outstanding Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time or (b) the value
of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of Company Shares entitled to appraisal rights exceeds $1 million. In
addition, a stockholder may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and accept the
consideration payable in connection with the Merger by delivering to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's
demand for appraisal and acceptance of the merger either within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger or thereafter with the
written approval of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery
shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Court deems just; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and
to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger.

        If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must NOT tender your Company Shares in the Offer and must strictly
comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If you fail to take any required step in connection with the
exercise of appraisal rights, it will result in the termination or waiver of your appraisal rights.

        The foregoing summary of the rights of the Company's stockholders to seek appraisal rights under Delaware law is qualified
in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL. The proper exercise of appraisal rights requires strict adherence to the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. A copy of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex B to this Schedule 14D-9.

Anti-Takeover Statutes

        As a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to Section 203 of the DGCL ("Section 203"). In general, Section 203 restricts an
"interested stockholder" (in general, a person who owns or has the right to acquire 15% or more of a corporation's outstanding voting
stock) from engaging in a "business combination" (defined to include mergers and certain other actions) with a Delaware corporation for
three years following the date such person became an interested stockholder unless: (a) before such person became an interested
stockholder, the board of directors of the corporation approved the transaction in which the interested stockholder became an interested
stockholder or approved the business combination; (b) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the interested stockholder
becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the
time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock
owned by the interested stockholder) those shares owned by (i) persons who are directors and also officers and

(ii) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to
the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or (c) following the transaction in which such person became an interested
stockholder, the business combination is (i) approved by the board of directors of the corporation and (ii) authorized at an annual or special
meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of the outstanding voting
stock of the corporation not owned by the interested stockholder. In accordance with the provisions of Section 203, the Company Board
has approved the Merger, the Merger Agreement, the Tender Agreement, the Offer and the Transactions, as described in this
Schedule 14D-9, and Parent and Purchaser have represented that neither they nor any of their "affiliates" or "associates" (as defined in
Section 203) are or have been an interested stockholder at any time during the past three years. Therefore, the restrictions of Section 203
are inapplicable to the Merger, the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement and the Tender Agreement.

        Many other states also have adopted laws and regulations applicable to attempts to acquire securities of corporations that are
incorporated or have substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive offices or principal places of business or whose business
operations otherwise have substantial economic effects in such states. In the event it is asserted that any such provisions apply to the Offer
or the Merger, the Company may be required to take certain actions with respect to such provisions.

Regulatory Approvals

Antitrust clearance

        Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain acquisition transactions may not be consummated unless certain
information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and the Federal Trade
Commission ("FTC") in Notification and Report Forms provided by the acquiring and acquired persons, and certain waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. The initial waiting period for a cash tender offer is 15 days, but this period may be (a) shortened if the
reviewing agency grants "early termination," (b) it may be restarted if the acquiring person voluntarily withdraws and re-files its
Notification and Report Form, or (c) it may be extended if the reviewing agency issues a request for additional information and
documentary material, in which case the waiting period expires 10 days after the date when the acquiring person has substantially
complied with such request. The purchase of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer is subject to such requirements. The Company will
file the Premerger Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the Antitrust Division in connection with the purchase of Company
Shares in the Offer and the Merger no later than 10 business days following the date of the Merger Agreement and the required waiting
period with respect to the Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York Time, 15 calendar days after such filings, unless (a) earlier terminated
by the FTC or the Antitrust Division, (b) restarted by the acquiring person voluntarily withdrawing and re-filing its Notification and
Report Form, or (c) extended by a request for additional information and documentary material prior to that time. The Antitrust Division
and the FTC assess the legality under the antitrust laws of transactions such as the acquisition of Company Shares by Purchaser pursuant
to the Offer. At any time before or after the consummation of any such transactions, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take such
action under the antitrust laws of the United States as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the
purchase of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer or seeking divestiture of the Company Shares so acquired or divestiture of substantial
assets of Parent, Purchaser and/or the Company. Private parties and individual States of the United States may also bring legal actions
under the antitrust laws of the United States. The Company does not believe that the consummation of the Offer will result in a violation of
any applicable antitrust laws. However, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the Offer on antitrust grounds will not be made, or if

Approval under National Security Regulations

        Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the "DPA"), authorizes the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States ("CFIUS") to review and investigate any merger, acquisition, or takeover that could result in control of a U.S. business by a
foreign person to determine whether the transaction threatens to impair the national security of the United States, whether any such threat
can be mitigated and whether to submit a recommendation to the President of the United States that he exercise his authority to suspend or
prohibit the completion of the transaction or require divestiture of the completed transaction. The filing of a notice of a transaction with
CFIUS pursuant to the DPA is voluntary, but CFIUS has the power to initiate a review in the absence of such a voluntary notice. CFIUS
has 30 calendar days from the date it accepts submission of a notice to review the proposed transaction and decide whether to conclude its
review or initiate an investigation if unresolved national security concerns remain. An investigation, if initiated, may take up to 45
calendar days. If, upon the expiration of the 45-day investigation period, CFIUS determines that a recommendation should be made to the
President, the President must decide within 15 calendar days whether to suspend or prohibit the transaction. Parent and the Company
intend to file with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice pursuant to the DPA with respect to the Transactions; however, clearance by CFIUS is
not a condition precedent to the completion of the Transactions.

        The Company and Parent intend to work with the DSS to develop an appropriate mitigation structure to address any foreign
ownership, control or influence ("FOCI") presented by the Transactions in compliance with the National Industrial Security Program
Operating Manual ("NISPOM") which requires a company that possesses a facility security clearance to notify the DSS that such
company is in negotiations with respect to a proposed merger acquisition or takeover by a foreign person. If it is determined that the
Transactions will place the Company under FOCI, the NISPOM requires that appropriate FOCI mitigation measures be implemented. The
Merger Agreement requires that each of Parent and the Company use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, subject to certain
limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, as promptly as practicable, the DSS Consent.

Annual and Quarterly Reports

        For additional information regarding the business and the financial results of the Company, please see the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
March 31, 2017.

Golden Parachute Compensation

        The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of
information about certain compensation for each named executive officer that is based on or otherwise relates to the Offer and the Merger.

        If the Offer and the Merger are completed in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the consummation of the Offer and
the Merger will constitute a "change in control" under the terms of the offer letters, employment agreements and other change in control
arrangements in effect with the Company's named executive officers, as described in the 2017 Proxy Statement (the "Employment
Arrangements"). The table below describes the estimated potential payments to each of the Company's named executive officers under
the terms of their respective Employment Arrangement and equity awards. The amounts shown reflect only the additional payments or
benefits that a named executive officer will receive as a result of the Merger or would have received upon the occurrence of the named
executive officer's termination of employment by the Company other than for "cause" or, if applicable, the named executive officer's
resignation with "good reason," within 12 to 24 months (as applicable) following a change in control of the Company. The amounts shown
do not include the value

of payments or benefits that would have been earned, or any amounts associated with equity awards that would vest pursuant to their terms
on or prior to the closing of the Offer and the Merger, absent the occurrence of the Merger and/or such a termination of employment, as
applicable. Please note that the amounts indicated below are estimates based on the material assumptions described in the notes to the table
below, which may or may not actually occur. Some of these assumptions are based on information currently unavailable and, as a result,
the actual amounts, if any, that may become payable to a named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set
forth below. Furthermore, for purposes of calculating such amounts, the Company has assumed:

• a price per share of the Company Shares of $7.10, which is the Offer Price; 

• the closing of the Offer and the Merger on September 30, 2017; and 

• with respect to each named executive officer, a termination of employment by the Company without "cause" or, if
applicable, by the executive for "good reason" or, in each case, on September 30, 2017, in which case such executive would
be entitled to receive each of the payments and benefits described in further detail below.

(2) Pursuant to the terms of the Guidance Software, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and
the award agreements thereunder, each award of Company Options and Company Restricted Shares will become
vested and exercisable, as applicable, as a result of the Merger (i.e., a "single trigger" arrangement"). Pursuant to the
terms of the Guidance Software, Inc. 2017 Incentive Award Plan and the award agreements thereunder, in the event
of a termination of the executive's employment either by the Company without "cause" or, if applicable, by the
executive for "good reason," in either case, on or within 12 months following the Merger (i.e., a "double trigger"
arrangement), any awards of Company Options of Company Restricted Shares held by the executive would become
fully vested and exercisable, as applicable (i.e., a "double trigger" arrangement). 

Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the employment agreements (as amended) with Messrs. Dennis and Plaga,
upon a qualifying termination of employment in connection with a change in control as described in footnote
(1) above (i.e. a "double trigger" arrangement), the executive would also be entitled to 100% accelerated vesting of
all outstanding equity awards held by the executive immediately prior to his termination of employment, with any
performance-based vesting awards vesting at target performance. 

The following table quantifies the value of the unvested Company Options and Company Restricted Shares held by
the named executive officers, assuming a price per Company Share equal to the Offer Price of $7.10, consistent with

ANNEX A 

        July 25, 2017

Board of Directors
Guidance Software, Inc.
1055 East Colorado Boulevard
Pasadena, CA 91106
United States

Members of the Board:

        We understand that Guidance Software, Inc. (the "Company"), Open Text Corporation (the "Parent") and Galileo Acquisition
Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the "Purchaser"), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially
in the form of the draft dated July 25, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), which provides, among other things, for (i) the commencement by
the Purchaser of a tender offer (the "Tender Offer") for all outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Common Stock") for $7.10 per share in cash (the "Consideration"), and (ii) the subsequent merger (the
"Merger") of the Purchaser with and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Parent, and each outstanding share of the Company Common Stock, other than shares held by the Parent, the Purchaser or the
Company, or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, the Purchaser or the Company, or held by a holder who is
entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, will be converted into the right to receive the Consideration. The
terms and conditions of the Tender Offer and the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

        You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of shares of the Company Common Stock.

        For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

1) Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company; 

2) Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company; 

3) Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company; 

4) Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior executives
of the Company; 

5) Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock; 

6) Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company Common Stock
with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the Company, and their securities; 

7) Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions; 

8) Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and the Parent and their legal
advisors; 

9) Reviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents; and

10) Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed
appropriate.

        We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was
publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With
respect to the financial projections, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company and of the future financial performance of the Company. In
addition, we have assumed that the Tender Offer and the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the definitive Merger
Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection
with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Tender Offer and
Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated
benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Tender Offer and Merger. We are not legal, tax, or regulatory advisors. We are financial
advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax, or regulatory
advisors with respect to legal, tax, or regulatory matters. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of the Company's officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be
received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the transaction. We have not made any independent valuation or
appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is
necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the
date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume
any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee
for our services, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we
have provided financing services for the Parent and have received fees in connection with such services. Morgan Stanley may also seek to
provide financial advisory and financing services to the Parent and the Company and their respective affiliates in the future and would
expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.

        Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual
wealth management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign
exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial

commodity, that may be involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument.

        This opinion has been approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with
our customary practice. This opinion is for the information of the Board of Directors of the Company and may not be used for any other

whether such stockholder should

connection with the Merger or with respect to any other matter.

        Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion on the date hereof that the Consideration to be received by the holders of

ANNEX B 

SECTION 262 OF THE
DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW

RIGHTS OF APPRAISAL 

Appraisal Rights.

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of
the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in
this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include
what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository
representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the
depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)
(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further
provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the
merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger
or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository
receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be
either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a.
and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or
§ 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of
the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set
forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the
words "merger or consolidation", and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving
or resulting corporation".

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in
which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section,
shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with §255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice
a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each
stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the
vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if
it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the
effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each
constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within
10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the tender or exchange offer

contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or
resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation
of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such
notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation
shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or
series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days
after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first
notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the tender
or exchange offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice
need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in
accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is
required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts
stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix,
in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is
given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is
fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw
such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the
consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or
resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this
section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from
the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by
the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be

accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed
for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on
the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the
hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems
advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the
surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold
stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair
value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue
at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the
effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any
stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to
the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving
or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated
stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates
representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such
surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to
be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided
in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective
date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal

shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting
corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the
written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of
any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date
of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or
resulting corporation.
