TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROPOSED MERGER — YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

The boards of directors of Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc. (“SONA”) and Eastern Virginia
Bankshares, Inc. (“EVBS”) have approved a strategic merger in which EVBS will merge with and into SONA.
The combined company, which will retain the SONA name, is expected to have approximately $2.4 billion in
assets, $2.0 billion in deposits and $1.8 billion in total loans. The combined company will operate offices
throughout Virginia and Maryland and will be the seventh largest Virginia-based community bank with assets
under $10 billion. We are sending you this document to ask you, as a SONA and/or EVBS shareholder, to
approve the merger.

In the merger, each share of EVBS common and preferred stock will be converted into the right to receive
0.6313 shares of SONA common stock. Although the number of shares of SONA common stock that EVBS
shareholders will receive is fixed, the market value of the merger consideration will fluctuate with the market
price of SONA common stock and will not be known at the time the EVBS shareholders vote on the merger.
Based on the average closing sale price for SONA common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market for the ten
trading days ended December 12, 2016 ($15.39), the last trading day before public announcement of the merger,
the 0.6313 exchange ratio represented approximately $9.72 in value for each share of EVBS common and
preferred stock. The most recent reported closing sale price for SONA common stock on May 10, 2017 was
$17.47. The most recent reported closing sale price for EVBS common stock on May 10, 2017 was $11.07. Based
on the exchange ratio and the number of shares of EVBS common and preferred stock outstanding and reserved
for issuance under various stock incentive plans and agreements, the maximum number of shares of SONA
common stock offered by SONA and issuable in the merger is 11,694,700. We urge you to obtain current market
quotations for SONA (trading symbol “SONA”) and EVBS (trading symbol “EVBS”).

Your vote is very important. We are holding special meetings of our respective shareholders to obtain
approval of the merger agreement and related plan of merger and related matters as described in the attached joint
proxy statement/prospectus, including with respect to both SONA and EVBS, approval, on a non-binding,
advisory basis, certain compensation proposals. Approval of the merger agreement and related plan of merger
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of more than two thirds of the outstanding shares of SONA common
stock, and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of EVBS common stock.
Both the SONA and EVBS compensation proposals, each to be approved on an advisory basis only, require the
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of SONA and EVBS common stock, as applicable.

Whether or not you plan to attend the SONA or EVBS special meeting, it is important that your shares be
represented at the meeting and your vote recorded. Please take the time to vote by completing and mailing the
enclosed proxy card or by voting via the Internet or telephone using the instructions given on the proxy card.
Even if you return the proxy card, you may attend the special meeting and vote your shares in person.

The boards of directors of SONA and EVBS unanimously recommend that you vote “FOR” approval
of the merger agreement and the related plan of merger and “FOR” the other matters to be considered at
each special meeting.

Q: What is the merger?
A: SONA and EVBS have entered into the merger agreement whereby EVBS will merge with and into SONA,

with SONA being the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, EVBS shareholders will have the
right to receive common stock of the Continuing Corporation in exchange for their EVBS common and/or
preferred stock. Upon the effective date of the merger, SONA common stock, including the shares issued to
former holders of EVBS common stock, will be the common stock of the Continuing Corporation.
Accordingly, the stock consideration to be received by holders of EVBS common and preferred stock is
referred to as “SONA common stock” as well as the common stock of the Continuing Corporation. A copy
of the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/ prospectus as Appendix A.

Q: What will EVBS shareholders receive in the merger?
A: In the proposed merger, holders of EVBS’s common stock will have the right to receive 0.6313 shares of

common stock of the Continuing Corporation for each share of EVBS common stock. In addition, the
holders of shares of EVBS non-voting mandatorily convertible non-cumulative preferred stock, Series B,
par value $2.00 per share, or EVBS preferred stock, will have the right to receive 0.6313 shares of common
stock of the Continuing Corporation for each share of EVBS preferred stock. This exchange ratio is fixed
and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of the merger. SONA shareholders
will continue to own their existing shares, which will not be affected by the merger.

Q: Why am I receiving these materials?
A: SONA and EVBS are each holding a special meeting of shareholders to vote on the proposals necessary to

complete the merger. We are sending you these materials to solicit your proxy and help you decide how to
vote your shares of SONA common stock or EVBS common stock at the special meetings. SONA and
EVBS common shareholders will be asked in separate company proposals to approve the SONA merger
proposal and the EVBS merger proposal, respectively. SONA and EVBS shareholders will also be asked to
approve their respective compensation proposals.

Q: What do I need to do now to vote my shares?
A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/ prospectus,

please vote your shares as soon as possible so that your shares will be represented at the SONA or EVBS
special meeting, as applicable. Please follow the instructions set forth on the proxy card or on the voting
instruction form provided by the record holder if your shares are held in the name of your broker or other
nominee.

Q: How do I vote?
A: By mail.   You may vote before the SONA or EVBS special meeting by completing, signing, dating and

returning the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

Q: May I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy card or voting instructions?
A: Yes. If you are a shareholder of record of common stock, you may change your vote at any time before your

proxy is voted at the applicable special meeting. You may do this in any of the following ways:

• by sending a notice of revocation to either the SONA corporate secretary or the EVBS corporate
secretary, as the case may be;

• by sending a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card;

• by voting via the Internet or telephone any time after delivering your proxy card or voting instructions
via the Internet or telephone; or

• by attending the SONA or EVBS special meeting and voting in person; your attendance alone will not
revoke any proxy.

Q: What would happen if either SONA shareholders or EVBS common shareholders do not approve the
applicable compensation proposal?

A: Neither approval of the SONA compensation proposal nor the approval of EVBS compensation proposal is
a condition to completion of the merger. The vote on these proposals are advisory votes and will not be
binding on SONA, EVBS or the Continuing Corporation regardless of whether the merger proposals are
approved. Accordingly, if the merger is approved and completed, certain of SONA’s and EVBS’s named
executive officers, as applicable, will be eligible to receive the various merger-related compensation that
may become payable in connection with the completion of the merger, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of the SONA shareholders
and the EVBS common shareholders.

Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to EVBS shareholders?
A: The merger will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In connection with the filing of the registration statement
of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, Alston & Bird LLP has delivered to SONA, and
Troutman Sanders LLP has delivered to EVBS, their respective opinions that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, subject to the limitations, assumptions and qualifications described in “Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences” (page 102), the merger will qualify as a reorganization. Accordingly, a holder of
EVBS common stock generally will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of the exchange of the holder’s shares of EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred stock for shares
of SONA common stock pursuant to the merger. However, EVBS common and preferred shareholders may
recognize gain or loss in connection with cash received instead of any fractional shares of SONA common
stock they would otherwise be entitled to receive. It is a condition to SONA’s and EVBS’s obligations to
complete the merger that they

vote against the SONA merger proposal. If you respond with an “abstain” vote, your proxy will have the
same effect as a vote against the SONA merger proposal. If you are a shareholder of record of common
stock and you sign and return your proxy card but do not indicate how you want to vote on the SONA
merger proposal, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the proposals.

If you are an EVBS common shareholder.   With respect to the EVBS merger proposal, if you fail to vote
or fail to instruct your broker or other nominee how to vote, your failure to vote will have the same effect as
a vote against the EVBS merger proposal. If you respond with an “abstain” vote, your proxy will have the
same effect as a vote against the EVBS merger proposal. If you are a shareholder of record of common stock
and you sign and return your proxy card but do not indicate how you want to vote on the EVBS merger
proposal, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the proposal.

If you choose either of the first two methods, your notice or new proxy card must be actually received before
the voting takes place at the applicable special meeting.

If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you should call your
broker or other nominee for additional information regarding how to change your vote.

Q: Do I have dissenters’ or appraisal rights?
A: No. Under Virginia law, shareholders of SONA and EVBS are not entitled to exercise dissenters’ or

appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

Q: If I am an EVBS shareholder with shares represented by stock certificates, should I send in my EVBS
stock certificates now?

A: No. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

Q: What should I do if I hold my shares of EVBS common stock in book-entry form?
A: After the completion of the merger, SONA will send you instructions on how to exchange your shares of

EVBS common stock held in book-entry form for shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation in
book-entry form and receive your check in lieu of fractional shares of common stock of the Continuing
Corporation.

Q: What happens if I sell or transfer ownership of shares of EVBS common stock after the record date
for the EVBS special meeting?

A: The record date for the EVBS special meeting is earlier than the expected date of completion of the merger.
Therefore, if you sell or transfer ownership of your shares of EVBS common stock after the record date for
the EVBS special meeting, but prior to completion of the merger, you will retain the right to vote at the
EVBS special meeting, but the right to receive the merger consideration will transfer with the shares of
EVBS common stock.

Q: Who should I contact if I have any questions about the proxy materials or voting?
A: If you have any questions about the merger or if you need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your

shares or need additional copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus or the enclosed proxy card:

• if you are a SONA shareholder, you should contact SONA’s investor relations department by calling

each receive a tax opinion, dated the closing date of the merger, that the merger will be treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These
opinions, however, will not bind the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or the courts, which could take a
contrary view. For greater detail, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page
102. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your
particular tax situation. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the specific tax consequences of
the merger to you.

If you are a holder of EVBS stock, you will receive written instructions from the exchange agent within five
business days after the merger is completed on how to exchange your EVBS stock certificates for shares of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUMMARY

This summary highlights selected information from this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We urge you to
read carefully the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents to which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus refers to understand fully the merger and the other matters to be considered at the special
meetings. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 128. Each item in this summary
includes a page reference directing you to a more complete description of that item.

The Merger (page 47)

SONA and EVBS are proposing a combination of our companies through a merger of EVBS with and into
SONA, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The parties expect to complete the merger
during the second quarter of 2017. The merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Appendix A. We encourage you to read the merger agreement because it is the legal document that governs the
merger.

If the merger is completed, it is expected that EVB, the wholly-owned subsidiary of EVBS, will merge with
and into Sonabank, the wholly-owned bank subsidiary of SONA, following the merger with Sonabank being the
surviving bank. The parties expect to complete the bank merger during the second quarter of 2017.

Consideration to be Received in the Merger by EVBS Shareholders (page 87)

In the proposed merger, holders of EVBS common stock will have the right to receive 0.6313 shares of
common stock of the Continuing Corporation for each share of EVBS common stock outstanding immediately
prior to the effective date of the merger and cash in lieu of any fractional shares. In addition, the holders of shares
of EVBS preferred stock will have the right to receive 0.6313 shares of common stock of the Continuing
Corporation for each share of EVBS preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the
merger and cash in lieu of any fractional shares.

The number of shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation delivered for each share of EVBS
common stock and EVBS preferred stock in the merger is referred to as the “exchange ratio.” This exchange ratio
is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of the merger. Based on the
average closing price of SONA’s common stock for the ten trading days ended December 12, 2016 ($15.39), the
0.6313 exchange ratio represented approximately $9.72 in value for each share of EVBS common and EVBS
preferred stock or $178.3 million in the aggregate. Based on the average closing price of SONA’s common stock
for the ten trading days ended May 10, 2017, the last trading day before the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the 0.6313 exchange ratio represented approximately $11.29 in value for each share of
EVBS common and EVBS preferred stock or $207.2 million in the aggregate. It is expected that existing holders
of EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred stock will own approximately 48.6% of SONA’s common stock, on
a fully diluted basis, after the merger.

Shares of SONA common stock held by SONA shareholders will remain unchanged in the merger. It is
expected that existing holders of SONA common stock will own approximately 51.4% of SONA’s outstanding
common stock, on a fully diluted basis, after the merger.

Treatment of EVBS Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards (page 88)

Stock Options.   In the merger, each outstanding EVBS stock option will vest and be converted into and
become an option to purchase shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation, which will be adjusted (i)
by multiplying the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased under the option by the exchange
ratio and rounding down to the nearest share, and (ii) by dividing the per share exercise price of the option by the
exchange ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent.

Restricted Stock Awards.   In the merger, each outstanding share of EVBS common stock subject to time-
based or performance-based vesting restrictions granted under a EVBS stock plan will, pursuant to the terms of
such grant, vest in full immediately prior to the merger and be converted into the right to receive unrestricted
shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation based on the exchange ratio.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Dividend Information (page 105)

SONA is currently paying a quarterly cash dividend on shares of its common stock at a rate of  $0.08 per
share. SONA has no current intention to change its dividend strategy of paying a quarterly cash dividend, but has
and will continue to evaluate that decision based on a quarterly review of earnings, growth, capital and such other
factors that the SONA board of directors considers relevant to the dividend decision process. EVBS currently
pays a quarterly cash dividend on shares of its common stock at a rate of $0.03 per share.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (page 102)

The merger will be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In
connection with the filing of the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part,
Alston & Bird LLP has delivered to SONA, and Troutman Sanders LLP has delivered to EVBS, their respective
opinions (Exhibits 8.1 and 8.2, respectively) that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to the limitations
and qualifications described in “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” (page 102), the merger will
qualify as a reorganization. Additionally, it is a condition to SONA’s and EVBS’s obligations to complete the
merger that they each receive a tax opinion, dated the closing date of the merger, that the merger will be treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Accordingly, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the merger generally will be tax-free to EVBS shareholders as
to the shares of SONA common stock they receive in the merger. However, EVBS shareholders may recognize
gain or loss in connection with cash received instead of any fractional shares of SONA common stock they would
otherwise be entitled to receive. We note that the opinions referenced herein will not bind the IRS or the courts,
which could take a contrary view.

The tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your own situation and the consequences
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus may not apply to you. EVBS shareholders will also be required
to file certain information with their U.S. federal income tax returns and to retain certain records with regard to
the merger. In addition, you may be subject to state, local or foreign tax laws and consequences that are not
addressed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor for a full
understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to you.

For greater detail, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 102.

SONA’s Board of Directors Unanimously Recommends that SONA Shareholders Vote “FOR” the SONA
Merger Proposal, “FOR” the SONA Compensation Proposal and “FOR” the SONA Adjournment
Proposal (page 39)

SONA’s board of directors has determined that the merger, the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of SONA and its shareholders and
has approved the merger agreement. The SONA board of directors unanimously recommends that SONA
shareholders vote “FOR” the SONA merger proposal, “FOR” the SONA compensation proposal and “FOR” the
SONA adjournment proposal. In making its recommendations, a number of substantive reasons were considered
by the SONA board, including, among others: (i) the expectation that the merger will create a $2.4 billion-asset
bank that will be the seventh largest Virginia-based community bank with assets under $10 billion; (ii) the belief
that the merger will allow the combined company to more effectively and efficiently navigate the challenges and
costs associated with becoming a larger financial institution; (iii) the expectation that the combined company will
have increased resources to invest in future growth opportunities in comparison to SONA on a stand-alone basis;
(iv) the complementary nature of EVBS’s business, operations and proficiencies with those of SONA; and (v) the
opportunities for greater efficiencies from conducting SONA’s and EVBS’s operations as part of a single
enterprise. For additional discussion of the factors considered by SONA’s board of directors in reaching its
decision to approve the merger agreement, see “The Merger — SONA’s Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of SONA’s Board of Directors.”

financial advisor, FIG Partners LLC (“FIG Partners”), which delivered to SONA’s board of directors its opinion
on December 13, 2016 that based upon and subject to the various considerations set forth in its written opinion,
the exchange ratio was fair to the shareholders of SONA from a financial point of view. A copy of FIG Partners’

exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement from a financial point of view to SONA, and does not
address any other aspect of the merger. FIG Partners’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation to

SONA special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (page 93)

SONA’s and EVBS’s respective obligations to complete the merger are subject to the fulfillment or waiver
of certain conditions, including the following:

Where the merger agreement and/or law permits, SONA and EVBS could choose to waive a condition to its
obligation to complete the merger even if that condition has not been satisfied. We cannot be certain when, or if,
the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger will be completed.

SONA and EVBS expect to complete the merger after all conditions to the merger in the merger agreement
are satisfied or waived, including after shareholder approvals are received at the respective special meetings of
SONA and EVBS. We currently expect to complete the merger during the second quarter of 2017. However, it is
possible that factors outside of either party’s control could require us to complete the merger at a later time or not
to complete it at all.

Interests of Certain SONA Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 73)

Some of the directors and executive officers of SONA may have interests in the merger that differ from, or
are in addition to, their interests as shareholders of SONA. These interests exist because of, among other things,
change in control agreements that provide certain officers with lump sum cash payments following a change in
control (defined to include the completion of the merger), certain supplemental executive retirement plans and
arrangements to continue as employees and directors of SONA and Sonabank following the merger. These
interests include the following:

Mr. Shearin will serve as president and chief executive officer of SONA and Sonabank upon
completion of the merger and will receive, among other benefits, an annual base salary to be
determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Continuing Corporation. In
addition, under Mr. Shearin’s new employment agreement with SONA and Sonabank, Mr. Shearin
would be entitled to certain change in control benefits if his employment terminates in certain
circumstances within one year following the merger, subject to potential reduction under a modified
Section 280G cutback provision. Mr. Shearin will not receive any change in control benefits under his
existing EVBS employment agreement in connection with the merger, but he will receive accelerated
vesting of his restricted stock awards with an approximate value of  $556,094 and accelerated vesting
(but not accelerated payment) of the normal retirement benefit under the EVBS supplemental executive
retirement plan with an approximate value of $874,005, discounted to present value, assuming in both
cases the merger was completed on April 1, 2017.

prior to the year in which termination occurs, with an approximate value to each of Ms. Derrico,
Mr. Porter and Mr. Baker of  $2,213,720, $1,001,550 and $335,040, respectively, assuming in each case
that the the merger was completed on April 1, 2017.

The members of the SONA board of directors knew about these additional interests and considered them when
they approved the merger agreement and the merger. See “The Merger — Interests of Certain SONA Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger”, on page 73.

Interests of Certain EVBS Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 75)

Some of the directors and executive officers of EVBS have interests in the merger that differ from, or are in
addition to, their interests as shareholders of EVBS. These interests exist because of, among other things,
employment agreements that the officers entered into with EVBS, rights that these officers and directors have
under EVBS’s benefit plans including equity plans (i.e., the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock awards),
the supplemental executive retirement plan and the executive severance plan, arrangements to continue as
employees and directors of SONA and Sonabank following the merger (including potential arrangements), and
rights to indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance following the merger. These interests
include the following, which have been calculated where applicable using assumptions set forth in “The Merger 
— Interests of Certain EVBS Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”, on page 75.

• A new employment agreement between SONA, Sonabank and J. Adam Sothen, pursuant to which
Mr. Sothen will serve as chief financial officer of SONA and Sonabank upon completion of the merger
and will receive, among other benefits, an annual base salary to be determined by the compensation
committee of the Board of Directors of the Continuing Corporation. Mr. Sothen will not receive any
change in control benefits under the EVBS executive severance plan, but he will receive accelerated
vesting of his restricted stock awards with an approximate value of $149,776, assuming the merger was
completed on April 1, 2017.

• The assumption by SONA of the employment agreement between EVBS and James S. Thomas, which
provides for certain change in control benefits if his employment terminates in certain circumstances
within one year following the merger. The total value of change in control benefits to which
Mr. Thomas would be entitled under his employment agreement with EVBS is approximately
$473,126, assuming the merger was completed and a qualifying termination of employment occurred
on April 1, 2017. In addition, Mr. Thomas will receive accelerated vesting of his restricted stock
awards with an approximate value of  $149,776, assuming the merger was completed on April 1, 2017.
Such payments and benefits would be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of an excise
tax under Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code.

• The assumption by SONA of the employment agreement between EVBS and Mark C. Hanna, which
provides for certain change in control benefits if his employment terminates in certain circumstances
within one year following the merger. The total value of change in control benefits to which Mr. Hanna
would be entitled under his employment agreement with EVBS is approximately $459,000, assuming
the merger was completed and a qualifying termination of employment occurred on April 1, 2017. In
addition, Mr. Hanna will receive accelerated vesting of his restricted stock awards with an approximate
value of  $45,540 and accelerated vesting (but not accelerated payment) of the normal retirement
benefit under the EVBS supplemental executive retirement plan with an approximate value of 
$367,015, discounted to present value, assuming in both cases the merger was completed on April 1,
2017.

• The assumption by SONA of the EVBS executive severance plan, which provides for certain change in
control benefits if a participating executive’s employment terminates in certain circumstances within
one year following the merger. The total value of change in control benefits to which Douglas R. Taylor
would be entitled under the EVBS executive severance plan is approximately $163,091, assuming the
merger was completed and a qualifying termination of employment occurred on April 1, 2017. The
total value of change in control benefits to which the three other participating EVBS executive officers
would be entitled under the executive severance plan is approximately $498,793 in the aggregate,
assuming the merger was completed and a qualifying termination of employment occurred with regard
to each of these executive officers on April 1, 2017.

• Accelerated vesting of shares of EVBS common stock held by Douglas R. Taylor with an approximate
value of  $149,776 and accelerated vesting of shares of EVBS common stock held by three other EVBS
executive officers who are not named executive officers, with an approximate value of  $320,804 in the
aggregate, assuming in both cases the merger was completed on April 1, 2017.

• The appointment, as provided under the terms of the merger agreement, of five current directors of
EVBS (Joe A. Shearin, John F. Biagas, W. Rand Cook, F.L. Garrett, III and Eric A. Johnson) to become
directors of SONA and Sonabank following the merger and one observer (J. Mikesell Thomas) to
SONA’s and Sonabank’s board of directors following the merger. Non-employee members of the board
of directors of SONA currently receive an annual retainer of  $25,000 each and the chairman of each
board committee currently receives an annual retainer of  $27,000, in each case payable quarterly, and
also participate in a stock matching program pursuant to which SONA funds the purchase of additional
shares of SONA common stock on behalf of a director in an amount equal to 66% of the shares of
SONA common stock otherwise purchased by the director, up to an annual value of  $10,000 per
director.

SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA OF SONA

The following table sets forth certain of SONA’s consolidated financial data as of the end of and for each of the years in the five-
year period ended December 31, 2016 and as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The historical consolidated
financial information as of the end of and for each of the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2016, is derived from
SONA’s audited consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial information as of and for the three month periods ended

consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation
of its financial position and results of operations for such periods. Interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are not

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA OF EVBS

The following table sets forth certain of EVBS’s consolidated financial data as of the end of and for each of
the years in the five-year period ended December 31, 2016 and as of and for the three months ended March 31,
2017 and 2016. The historical consolidated financial information as of the end of and for each of the years in the
five-year period ended December 31, 2016, is derived from EVBS’s audited consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial information as of and for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is
derived from EVBS’s unaudited consolidated financial statements. In EVBS’s opinion, such unaudited
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary
for a fair presentation of its financial position and results of operations for such periods. Interim results for the
three months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of, and are not projections for, the results to be
expected for the full year ending December 31, 2017.

The selected historical financial data below is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements that are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/ prospectus and
their accompanying notes.

(1) Ratios for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are presented on an annualized basis.

(2) The efficiency ratio is computed by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and
noninterest income, net of gains or losses.

(3) NPAs consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days and accruing interest and other real estate owned.

(4) For the year to date period ending March 31, 2017, the calculation is based on diluted earnings per share for the three months
ended March 31, 2017 plus diluted earnings per share for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2016. For the year to date period
ending March 31, 2016, the calculation is based on diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2016 plus
diluted earnings per share for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the separate
historical financial statements of SONA and EVBS after giving effect to the merger and the assumptions and
adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as if the merger between
SONA and EVBS had occurred on March 31, 2017, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income
statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016 are
presented as if the merger between SONA and EVBS had occurred on January 1, 2016. The historical
consolidated financial information has been adjusted to reflect factually supportable items that are directly
attributable to the merger.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using the acquisition
method of accounting for business combinations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. SONA is the acquirer for accounting purposes. SONA has not had sufficient time to completely evaluate
the significant identifiable long-lived tangible and identifiable intangible assets of EVBS. Accordingly, the
unaudited pro forma adjustments, including the allocations of the purchase price, are preliminary and have been
made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.

A final determination of the acquisition consideration and fair values of EVBS assets and liabilities, which
cannot be made prior to the completion of the merger, will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible
assets of EVBS that exist as of the date of completion of the transaction. Consequently, amounts preliminarily
allocated to goodwill and identifiable intangibles could change significantly from those allocations used in the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements presented below and could result in a material
change in amortization of acquired intangible assets.

In connection with the plan to integrate the operations of SONA and EVBS following the completion of the
merger, SONA and EVBS anticipate that nonrecurring charges, such as costs associated with system
implementation, severance, and other costs related to exit or disposal activities will be incurred. Direct
transaction-related expenses estimated at $16 million for the two companies are included in the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are provided for informational purposes
only. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not necessarily, and should not be
assumed to be, an indication of the results that would have been achieved had the transaction been completed as
of the dates indicated or that may be achieved in the future. The preparation of the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements and related adjustments required management to make certain
assumptions and estimates. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read
together with:

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2017 presents the consolidated
financial position giving pro forma effect to the following transactions as if they had occurred as of March 31,
2017:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA UNAUDITED SHARE DATA

Summarized below is historical unaudited per share information for SONA and EVBS and additional information as if the
companies had been combined for the periods shown, which is referred to as “pro forma” information.

The EVBS pro forma equivalent per share amounts are calculated by multiplying the SONA pro forma combined book value per
share and net income per share by the exchange ratio of 0.6313 so that the per share amounts equate to the respective values for one
share of EVBS common stock.

It is expected that both SONA and EVBS will incur merger and integration charges as a result of the merger. Also anticipated is
that the merger will provide the combined company with financial benefits that may include reduced operating expenses. The
information set forth below, while helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of
assumptions, may not reflect all of these anticipated financial expenses and does not reflect all of these anticipated financial benefits or
consider any potential impacts of current market conditions or the merger on revenues, expense efficiencies, asset dispositions, and
share repurchases, among other factors, and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. It also does not
necessarily reflect what the historical results of the combined company would have been had the companies been combined during the
periods presented.

In addition, the information set forth below has been prepared based on preliminary estimates of merger consideration and fair
values attributable to the merger; the actual amounts recorded for the merger may differ from the information presented. The
estimation and allocations of merger consideration are subject to change pending further review of the fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed and actual transaction costs. A final determination of fair value will be based on the actual net tangible and
intangible assets and liabilities of EVBS that will exist on the date of completion of the merger.

The information in the following table is based on, and should be read together with, the historical financial information and the
notes thereto for SONA and EVBS incorporated by reference into, or contained in, this joint proxy statement/ prospectus.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to general investment risks and the other information contained in or incorporated by reference
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed under the heading “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 33, you should consider carefully the following risk
factors in deciding how to vote on the proposals presented in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Certain risks
can also be found in the documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by SONA
and EVBS, including in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” in the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2016 filed by SONA and EVBS with the SEC on March 16, 2017 and March 15, 2017,
respectively. See “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 128.

Risks Related to the Merger

Because of the fixed exchange ratio and the fluctuation of the market price of SONA common stock,
shareholders of SONA and EVBS will not know at the time of the special meetings the market value of the
merger consideration to be paid by SONA to EVBS shareholders.

In the merger, each share of EVBS common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.6313 shares
of common stock of the Continuing Corporation, the value of which will depend upon the price of SONA
common stock at the effective date of the merger, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares. Upon the effective
date of the merger, SONA common stock, including the shares issued to former holders of EVBS common stock,
will be the common stock of the Continuing Corporation. The price of SONA common stock as of the effective
date of the merger may vary significantly from its price at the date the fixed exchange ratio was established, at the
date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and at the date of the special meetings. There will be no adjustment
to the merger consideration for changes in the market price of either shares of SONA common stock or shares of
EVBS common stock. There also is no maximum or minimum closing price of SONA common stock at which
EVBS or SONA may unilaterally terminate the merger agreement. Variations in the price of SONA common
stock may result from changes in the business, operations or prospects of SONA, regulatory considerations,
general market and economic conditions, and other factors, many of which are outside of the control of SONA.
At the time of the special meetings, shareholders of SONA and EVBS will not know the exact value of the
consideration to be paid by SONA when the merger is completed, which value could be significantly less than the
current market value of EVBS common stock. You should obtain current market quotations for shares of SONA
common stock and for shares of EVBS common stock.

The merger will not be completed unless important conditions are satisfied or waived, including approval by
both SONA and EVBS shareholders.

Specified conditions set forth in the merger agreement must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger
and the bank merger. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, to the extent permitted by law or stock
exchange rules, the merger and the bank merger will not occur or will be delayed and each of SONA and EVBS
may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the merger. The following conditions, in addition to other closing
conditions, must be satisfied or waived, if permissible, before SONA and EVBS are obligated to complete the
merger:

• The shares of SONA common stock to be issued in the merger must have been approved for listing on
the NASDAQ Global Market, subject to official notice of issuance.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For a more detailed description of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement that must be satisfied or
waived to complete the merger, see “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to Completion of the Merger”
beginning on page 93.

EVBS common shareholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable shareholders to dissent from an
extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares
as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to shareholders in
connection with the extraordinary transaction. The Virginia SCA provides that appraisal rights are not available
to holders of stock of a Virginia corporation in a merger when the stock is listed on a national securities
exchange, such as the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The common stock of EVBS is listed on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market. Therefore, EVBS common shareholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection
with the merger.

The merger agreement limits the ability of SONA and EVBS to pursue alternatives to the merger and might
discourage competing offers for a higher price or premium.

The merger agreement contains “no-shop” provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, limit the ability of
SONA and EVBS to discuss, facilitate or commit to competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant
part of each company. In addition, under certain circumstances, if the merger agreement is terminated and either
SONA or EVBS, subject to certain restrictions, consummates a similar transaction other than the merger, the
party consummating such transaction must pay to the other a termination fee of $7.5 million. These provisions
might discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant
percentage of ownership of SONA or EVBS from considering or proposing the acquisition even if it were
prepared to pay consideration, with respect to EVBS, with a higher per share market price than that proposed in
the merger, and with respect to SONA, with a per share market price that would amount to a premium over the
current per share market price of SONA. See “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fee” on page 98.

Neither of the fairness opinions received by the respective boards of directors of SONA and EVBS in
connection with the merger has been updated to reflect changes in circumstances since the dates of such
opinions.

The opinions rendered by FIG Partners, dated December 13, 2016, and by Sandler O’Neill, dated
December 13, 2016, were based upon information available to each advisor as of such date. Neither opinion has
been or will be updated to reflect changes that may occur or may have occurred after the date on which such
opinion was delivered, including changes to the operations and prospects of SONA or EVBS, changes in general
market and economic conditions, or other factors that may be beyond the control of SONA and EVBS. Any such
changes may alter the relative value of SONA or EVBS or the prices of shares of SONA common stock or EVBS
common stock by the time the merger is completed. The opinions do not speak as of the date the merger will be
completed or as of any date other than the date of such opinions. The merger agreement does not require that
either FIG Partners’ or Sandler O’Neill’s opinion be updated as a condition to the completion of the merger, and
neither SONA nor EVBS intends to request that the respective fairness opinions be updated. FIG Partners’
fairness opinion and Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion are attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
Appendix B and Appendix C, respectively. For a description of the opinion that SONA received from its financial
advisor, please see “The Merger — Opinion of SONA’s Financial Advisor,” beginning on page 53. For a
description of the opinion that EVBS received from its financial advisor, please see “The Merger — Opinion of
EVBS’s Financial Advisor,” beginning on page 62.

Certain of SONA’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that differ from the interests of
SONA’s other shareholders.

SONA’s shareholders should be aware that some of SONA’s directors and executive officers have interests in
the merger and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of SONA’s

shareholders generally. The SONA board of directors was aware of these interests and considered these interests,
among other matters, when making its decision to approve the merger agreement and the plan of merger, and in
recommending that SONA’s shareholders vote in favor of approving the SONA merger proposal. These interests
include the following: (i) employment agreements with respect to employment with SONA after the merger of
each of Ms. Derrico and Messrs. Porter and Baker; (ii) the payment of certain change in control payments
pursuant to change in control agreements currently in place with each of Ms. Derrico and Messrs. Porter and
Baker; (iii) other merger-related compensation payable to certain named executive officers; and (iv) that
following the merger six current directors of SONA (Ms. Derrico, Mr. Porter, Neil J. Call, Robert Y. Clagett, W.
Bruce Jennings and Charles A. Kabbash) will serve as directors of SONA and Sonabank. For a more complete
description of these interests, see “The Merger — Interests of Certain SONA Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger.”

Further, the directors and executive officers of SONA have entered into agreements with each of SONA and
EVBS pursuant to which they have agreed, subject to several conditions and exceptions, to vote all of the shares
of SONA common stock owned by such shareholder and over which such shareholder has sole voting and
investment power (and, with respect to Ms. Derrico and Mr. Porter only, shares jointly owned by them and over
which they have shared voting and investment power), in favor of the SONA merger proposal and against any
competing acquisition proposal and any action, proposal, transaction or agreement which could reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the timely consummation of the
merger or the fulfillment of SONA’s or EVBS’s conditions under the merger agreement. The affiliate agreements
terminate upon the earlier to occur of the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement in
accordance with its terms. See “The Merger Agreement — Affiliate Agreements.”

Certain of EVBS’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that differ from the interests of
EVBS’s other shareholders.

EVBS’s shareholders should be aware that some of EVBS’s directors and executive officers have interests in
the merger and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of EVBS’s shareholders
generally. The EVBS board of directors was aware of these interests and considered these interests, among other
matters, when making its decision to approve the merger agreement and the plan of merger, and in recommending
that EVBS’s shareholders vote in favor of approving the EVBS merger proposal. These interests include the
following: (i) employment agreements with respect to employment with SONA after the merger of each of
Messrs. Shearin and Sothen; (ii) the treatment of outstanding EVBS restricted stock awards pursuant to the
merger agreement and the terms of such instruments; (iii) potential change in control benefits to be paid to
Messrs. Thomas and Hanna under their respective employment agreements with EVBS if their employment
terminates in certain circumstances within one year following the merger; (iv) accelerated vesting (but not
accelerated payment) of the normal retirement benefit for Messrs. Shearin and Hanna under the EVBS
supplemental executive retirement plan upon completion of the merger; (v) change in control benefits to be paid
to four EVBS executive officers under the EVBS executive severance plan if their employment terminates in
certain circumstances within one year following the merger; (vi) that following the merger five current directors
of EVBS (Joe Shearin, John F. Biagas, W. Rand Cook, F.L. Garrett, III and Eric A. Johnson) will serve as
directors of SONA and Sonabank and J. Mikesell Thomas will serve as an observer to SONA’s and Sonabank’s
board of directors; and (vii) rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage by SONA following the
merger for acts or omissions occurring after the merger. For a more complete description of these interests, see
“The Merger — Interests of Certain EVBS Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Further, the directors and executive officers of EVBS have entered into agreements with each of SONA and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SONA and EVBS will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is
pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on
SONA and EVBS. These uncertainties may impair SONA’s and EVBS’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key
personnel until the merger is completed and could cause customers and others that deal with SONA and EVBS to
seek to change existing business relationships. Retention of certain employees by SONA and EVBS may be
challenging while the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles
with the Continuing Corporation. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and
difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with SONA or EVBS, SONA’s or EVBS’s business, or the
business of the Continuing Corporation following the merger, could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain
exceptions, SONA and EVBS have each agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to closing and
refrain from taking certain specified actions until the merger occurs, which may prevent SONA or EVBS from
pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to completion of the merger. See “The Merger
Agreement — Business Pending the Merger” on page 93 for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable
to SONA and EVBS.

The merger may distract management of SONA and EVBS from their other responsibilities.

The merger could cause the respective management groups of SONA and EVBS to focus their time and
energies on matters related to the transaction that otherwise would be directed to their business and operations.
Any such distraction on the part of either company’s management could affect its ability to service existing
business and develop new business and adversely affect the business and earnings of SONA or EVBS before the
merger, or the business and earnings of the Continuing Corporation after the merger.

Termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact SONA or EVBS.

If the merger agreement is terminated, SONA’s or EVBS’s business may be impacted adversely by the
failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing
any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated, the
market price of SONA’s or EVBS’s common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices
reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed. Furthermore, costs relating to the merger, such as
legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed. In addition,
failure to complete the merger could result in reputational harm to SONA and EVBS. If the merger agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances, including circumstances involving a change in recommendation by
SONA’s or EVBS’s board of directors, SONA or EVBS may be required to pay to the other party a termination
fee of  $7.5 million. See “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fee” on page 98. If the merger agreement is
terminated and the EVBS board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, EVBS shareholders
cannot be certain that EVBS will be able to find a party willing to pay the equivalent or greater consideration than
that which SONA has agreed to pay in the merger.

If the merger is not completed, SONA and EVBS will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the
expected benefits of the merger.

Each of SONA and EVBS has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the
negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and
expenses of filing, printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and all filing and other fees paid to
the SEC in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, SONA and EVBS would have to incur
these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.

Litigation may be filed against the board of directors of SONA and/or EVBS that could prevent or delay the
completion of the merger or result in the payment of damages following completion of the merger.

In connection with the merger, it is possible that SONA shareholders and/or EVBS shareholders may file
putative class action lawsuits against the boards of directors of SONA and/or EVBS. Among other remedies,
these shareholders could seek to enjoin the merger. The outcome of any such litigation would be uncertain. If a
dismissal is not granted or a settlement is not reached, such potential lawsuits could prevent

TABLE OF CONTENTS

or delay completion of the merger and result in substantial costs to SONA and EVBS, including any costs
associated with indemnification obligations of SONA and/or EVBS. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or
claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is consummated may adversely affect the Continuing
Corporation’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and market price.

Risks Related to the Continuing Corporation Following the Merger

Combining SONA and EVBS may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than we expect.

The success of the merger will depend, in part, on SONA’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost
savings from combining the businesses of SONA and EVBS and to combine the businesses of SONA and EVBS
in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost savings to be realized without materially disrupting the
existing customer relationships of SONA or EVBS or decreasing revenues due to loss of customers. However, to
realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, SONA must successfully combine the businesses of SONA
and EVBS. If SONA is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the
merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.

SONA and EVBS have operated, and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate,
independently. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on SONA’s ability to successfully combine the
businesses of SONA and EVBS. To realize these anticipated benefits, after the completion of the merger, SONA
expects to integrate EVBS’s business into its own. The integration process in the merger could result in the loss
of key employees, the disruption of each party’s ongoing business, inconsistencies in standards, controls,
procedures and policies that affect adversely either party’s ability to maintain relationships with customers and
employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect
SONA’s ability to successfully conduct its business in the markets in which EVBS now operates, which could
have an adverse effect on SONA’s financial results and the value of its common stock. If SONA experiences
difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized, fully or at all,
or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be
disruptions that cause SONA and EVBS to lose customers or cause customers to withdraw their deposits from
SONA’s or EVBS’s banking subsidiaries, or other unintended consequences that could have a material adverse
effect on SONA’s results of operations or financial condition after the merger. These integration matters could
have an adverse effect on each of EVBS and SONA during this transition period and for an undetermined period
after consummation of the merger.

If SONA and EVBS do not successfully integrate, the Continuing Corporation may not realize the expected
benefits from the merger.

Integration in connection with a merger is sometimes difficult, and there is a risk that integrating SONA and
EVBS may take more time and resources than we expect. SONA’s ability to integrate EVBS and its future
success depend in large part on the ability of members of its board of directors and executive officers to work
together effectively. After the merger, SONA will be governed by a board of directors comprised of 11 directors,
of which six are current directors of SONA (Georgia S. Derrico, R. Roderick Porter, Neil J. Call, Robert Y.
Clagett, W. Bruce Jennnings and Charles A. Kabbash) and five are current directors of EVBS (Joe A. Shearin,
John F. Biagas, W. Rand Cook, F.L. Garrett, III and Eric A. Johnson). There will also be one observer designated
by EVBS, J. Mikesell Thomas. Disagreements among board members and executive management could arise in
connection with integration issues, strategic considerations and other matters. As a result, there is a risk that
SONA’s board of directors and executive officers may not be able to operate effectively, which would affect
adversely SONA’s ability to integrate the operations of SONA and EVBS successfully and SONA’s future
operating results.

SONA may not be able to effectively integrate the operations of EVB into Sonabank.

The future operating performance of SONA and Sonabank will depend, in part, on the success of the merger
of EVB and Sonabank. After the merger of SONA and EVBS, and at a time to be determined by SONA, EVB
will be merged with and into Sonabank with Sonabank surviving. Following the bank merger,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

the board of directors of Sonabank will be comprised of eleven directors, of which six are current directors of
SONA (Georgia S. Derrico, R. Roderick Porter, Neil J. Call, Robert Y. Clagett, W. Bruce Jennnings and Charles
A. Kabbash) and five are current directors of EVBS (Joe A. Shearin, John F. Biagas, W. Rand Cook, F.L. Garrett,
III and Eric A. Johnson). There will also be one observer designated by EVBS, J. Mikesell Thomas. Following
the bank merger, Ms. Derrico will continue to serve as executive chairman of the board of directors of SONA and
Sonabank and as executive chairman of SONA and Sonabank; Mr. Porter will continue to serve as executive vice
chairman of the board of directors of SONA and Sonabank and as executive vice chairman of SONA and
Sonabank; Mr. Shearin will serve as president and chief executive officer of Sonabank; Mr. J. Adam Sothen will
serve as chief financial officer of Sonabank; William H. Lagos will serve as chief accounting officer of
Sonabank; Thomas P. Baker will serve as co-chief credit officer of Sonabank; James S. Thomas will serve as co-
chief credit officer of Sonabank; William H. Stevens will serve as executive vice president and chief credit risk
officer of Sonabank; and Douglas R. Taylor will serve as executive vice president and chief risk officer of
Sonabank.

The success of the merger of the banks will, in turn, depend on a number of factors, including SONA’s
ability to: (i) integrate the operations and branches of EVB and Sonabank; (ii) retain the deposits and customers
of EVB and Sonabank; (iii) control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from the merger in a
manner that enables the combined bank to improve its overall operating efficiencies; and (iv) retain and integrate
the appropriate personnel of EVB into the operations of Sonabank, as well as reducing overlapping bank
personnel. The integration of EVB and Sonabank following the subsidiary bank merger will require the
dedication of the time and resources of the banks’ management and may temporarily distract managements’
attention from the day-to-day business of the banks. If Sonabank is unable to successfully integrate EVB,
Sonabank may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs.

Future results of the Continuing Corporation may be materially different from those reflected in the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus because such financial statements are preliminary and do not reflect actual merger-
related expenses and restructuring charges.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in this document are presented for
illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the Continuing Corporation’s actual financial
condition or results of operations would have been had the merger been completed on the dates indicated. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect adjustments to illustrate the effect of the
merger had it been completed on the dates indicated, which are based upon preliminary estimates, to record the
EVBS identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The
purchase price allocation for the merger reflected in this document is preliminary, and final allocation of the
purchase price will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of
EVBS as of the date of the completion of the merger. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments
may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this document.

In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus only show a combination of SONA’s and EVBS’s historical results, and they do not
necessarily indicate the future financial condition or operating results of the Continuing Corporation. SONA
estimates that the Continuing Corporation will record an aggregate of approximately $11,395,000, net of income
tax effect, in merger-related expenses and restructuring charges. The actual charges may be higher or lower than
estimated, depending upon how costly or difficult it is to integrate the two companies. These charges will
decrease the capital of the Continuing Corporation available for future profitable, income-earning investments.

For more information, see “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

Risks Related to Ownership of the Common Stock of the Continuing Corporation

The market price of SONA common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those
affecting the shares of SONA or EVBS currently.

Upon completion of the merger, holders of EVBS common stock will become holders of SONA common
stock. SONA’s business differs in important respects from that of EVBS, and, accordingly, the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

results of operations of the Continuing Corporation and the market price of SONA common stock after the
completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent
results of operations of each of SONA and EVBS. For a discussion of the businesses of SONA and EVBS and of
certain factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the information described elsewhere in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated herein by reference.

Current holders of SONA and EVBS common stock will have less influence as holders of Continuing
Corporation common stock after the merger.

It is expected that the current holders of SONA common stock will own approximately 51.4% of the
outstanding common stock of the Continuing Corporation after the merger. As a group, the current holders of
common stock of EVBS will own approximately 48.6% of the outstanding common stock of the Continuing
Corporation after the merger. Each current holder of SONA and EVBS common stock will own a smaller
percentage of the Continuing Corporation after the merger than they currently own of SONA or EVBS,
respectively. As a result of the merger, holders of SONA and EVBS common stock will have less influence on
the management and policies of the Continuing Corporation than they currently have on the management and
policies of SONA or EVBS, respectively.

SONA is not obligated to pay cash dividends on its common stock.

SONA is a bank holding company and, currently, its primary source of funds for paying dividends to its
shareholders is dividends it receives from Sonabank. SONA is currently paying a quarterly cash dividend to
holders of its common stock at a rate of  $0.08 per share. However, SONA is not obligated to pay dividends in
any particular amounts or at any particular times. Its decision to pay dividends in the future will depend on a
number of factors, including its capital and the availability of funds from which dividends may be paid. See
“Market for Common Stock and Dividends” on page 105 and “Description of SONA Capital Stock” on page 109.

The shares of SONA common stock to be received by EVBS shareholders as a result of the merger will have
different rights than shares of EVBS common stock.

Upon completion of the merger, EVBS shareholders will become SONA shareholders and their rights as
shareholders will be governed by Virginia law and SONA’s articles of incorporation and bylaws. The rights
associated with EVBS common stock are different from the rights associated with SONA common stock. See
“Comparative Rights of Shareholders” beginning on page 111 for a discussion of the different rights associated
with SONA common stock.

Risks Relating to SONA’s Business

There are certain risks relating to SONA’s business.

You should read and consider risk factors specific to SONA’s business that will also affect the Continuing
Corporation after the merger. These risks are described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in SONA’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and in other documents incorporated by reference
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 128 for the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SONA SPECIAL MEETING

Date, Place and Time

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is first being mailed on or about May 15, 2017 to SONA shareholders
who held shares of SONA common stock, par value $0.01 per share, on April 24, 2017, the record date for the
SONA special meeting of shareholders. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is accompanied by the notice of the
special meeting and a form of proxy that is solicited by the SONA board of directors for use at the special
meeting to be held on Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 3:00 p.m. local time, at International Country Club, located at
13200 Lee Jackson Highway, Fairfax, Virginia 22033, and at any adjournments of that meeting.

Purposes of the SONA Special Meeting

At the special meeting, the shareholders of SONA will be asked:

Recommendation of the SONA Board of Directors

The SONA board of directors believes that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement are advisable and in the best interests of SONA and its shareholders and unanimously
recommends that SONA shareholders vote “FOR” each of the proposals that will be presented at the SONA
special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Record Date and Voting Rights; Quorum

The SONA board of directors has fixed the close of business on April 24, 2017 as the record date for
determining the shareholders of SONA entitled to notice of and to vote at the SONA special meeting or any
adjournments thereof. Accordingly, you are only entitled to notice of and to vote at the SONA special meeting if
you were a record holder of SONA common stock at the close of business on the record date. At that date,
12,330,043 shares of SONA common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote.

To have a quorum that permits SONA to conduct business at the SONA special meeting, the presence,
whether in person or by proxy, of the holders of SONA’s common stock representing a majority of the voting
shares outstanding on the record date is required. You are entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of
SONA common stock you held as of the close of business on the record date.

Holders of shares of SONA common stock present in person at the special meeting but not voting, and
shares of SONA common stock for which proxy cards are received indicating that their holders have abstained,
will be counted as present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum for
transacting business. Shares held in “street name” that have been designated by brokers on proxies as not voted
will not be counted as votes cast for or against any proposal and will not be counted for purposes of determining
the presence of a quorum unless the broker has been instructed to vote on at least one of the proposals for the
SONA special meeting.

Votes Required

Vote Required for Approval of the SONA Merger Proposal.   The approval of the SONA merger proposal
requires the vote of more than two-thirds of the shares of SONA common stock outstanding on the record date
for the special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast on the proposal. Because,
however, approval of the SONA merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of more than two-thirds of the
shares of SONA common stock outstanding on the record date for the special meeting, failures to vote,
abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same vote as votes against the SONA merger proposal.

Vote Required for Approval of the SONA Compensation Proposal.   The approval of the SONA
compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of SONA common stock voted on
the proposal.

Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast and will have no effect for
purposes of determining whether the SONA compensation proposal has been approved.

The vote regarding this non-binding advisory proposal on SONA merger-related compensation is a vote
separate and apart from the vote to approve the SONA merger proposal. Accordingly, SONA’s shareholders may
vote to approve the SONA merger proposal and vote not to approve the SONA compensation proposal and vice
versa. Because the vote regarding the SONA compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on
either SONA or, following completion of the merger, the combined company. Accordingly, if the merger is
approved and completed, SONA’s named executive officers will be eligible to receive the various merger-related
compensation that may become payable in connection with the completion of the merger, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of the SONA
shareholders.

Vote Required for Approval of the SONA Adjournment Proposal.   The approval of the SONA
adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of SONA common stock voted on
the proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.

Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast and will have no effect for
purposes of determining whether the SONA adjournment proposal has been approved.

Stock Ownership of SONA Executive Officers and Directors

Each director and executive officer of SONA has entered into an agreement with SONA and EVBS pursuant
to which he or she has agreed to vote all of his or her shares in favor of the SONA merger proposal, subject to
certain exceptions, including that certain shares they hold in a fiduciary capacity or for which they do not have
sole voting or dispositive power are not covered by the agreement (except with respect to Ms. Derrico and Mr.
Porter only, shares jointly owned by them and over which they have shared voting and investment power). As of
the record date, directors and executive officers of SONA and their affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled
to vote approximately 1,252,304 shares of SONA common stock at the SONA special meeting, or approximately
10.2% of the total voting power of shares of SONA common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, of
which 1,149,738 shares or 9.3% of the total voting power of the shares of SONA common stock outstanding on
that date are subject to an affiliate agreement.

Voting at the SONA Special Meeting

Record Holders.   If your shares of SONA common stock are held of record in your name, your shares can
be voted at the SONA special meeting in any of the following ways:

By Mail.   You can vote your shares by using the proxy card that is enclosed for your use in connection with
the special meeting. If you complete and sign the proxy card and return it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope,
you will be appointing the “proxies” named in the proxy card to vote your shares for you at the special meeting.
The authority you will be giving the proxies is described in the proxy card. When your proxy card is returned
properly executed, the shares of SONA common stock represented by it will be voted at the SONA special
meeting in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy card.

If proxy cards are returned properly executed without an indication as to how the proxies should vote, the
SONA common stock represented by each such proxy card will be considered to be voted (i) “FOR” the SONA
merger proposal, (ii) “FOR” the SONA compensation proposal and (iii) “FOR” the SONA adjournment proposal.

• you can give SONA’s Chief Financial Officer a written notice, before the SONA special meeting or, if
hand delivered, before the voting takes place at the SONA special meeting, that you want to revoke
your proxy card; or

• you can attend the SONA special meeting and vote in person or notify SONA’s Corporate Secretary,
before the voting takes place that you want to revoke your proxy card. Simply attending the special
meeting alone, without voting in person or notifying SONA’s Corporate Secretary, will not revoke your
proxy card.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

By the Internet or Telephone.   You can appoint the proxies to vote your shares for you by going to the
Internet website www.investorvote.com/sona or by calling 1-800-652-VOTE (8683). When you are prompted for
your “control number,” enter the number printed just above your name on the enclosed proxy card, and then
follow the instructions provided. You may vote by the Internet or telephone only until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time
on June 20, 2017.

If you vote by the Internet or telephone, you need not sign and return a proxy card. Under Virginia law, you
will be appointing the proxies to vote your shares on the same terms as are described above and with the same
authority as if you completed, signed and returned a proxy card. The authority you will be giving the proxies is
described in the proxy card.

In Person.   You can attend the SONA special meeting and vote in person. A ballot will be provided for
your use at the meeting.

Your vote is important. Accordingly, please sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card, whether or
not you plan to attend the SONA special meeting in person.

Shares Held in “Street Name.”   Only the record holders of shares of SONA common stock, or their
appointed proxies, may vote those shares. As a result, if your shares of SONA common stock are held for you in
“street name” by a broker or other nominee, such as a bank or custodian, then only your broker or nominee (i.e.,
the record holder) may vote them for you, or appoint the proxies to vote them for you, unless you previously have
made arrangements for your broker or nominee to assign its voting rights to you or for you to be recognized as
the person entitled to vote your shares. You will need to follow the directions your broker or nominee provides
you and give it instructions as to how it should vote your shares by following the instructions you received from
your broker or nominee with your copy of this joint proxy statement/ prospectus. Brokers and other nominees who
hold shares in “street name” for their clients typically have the discretionary authority to vote those shares on
“routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners of the shares. However, they
may not vote those shares on “non-routine” matters, such as the proposals that will be presented at the SONA
special meeting, unless their clients give them voting instructions. To ensure that your shares are represented at
the SONA special meeting and voted in the manner you desire, it is important that you instruct your broker or
nominee as to how it should vote your shares.

If your shares are held in “street name” and you wish to vote them in person at the SONA special meeting,
you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record.

Revocation of Proxies

Record Holders.   If you are the record holder of shares of SONA common stock and you sign and return a
proxy card and you later wish to revoke the authority or change the voting instructions you gave the proxies, you
can do so at any time before the voting takes place at the SONA special meeting by taking the appropriate action
described below.

To change the voting instructions you gave the proxies, you can complete, sign and submit a new proxy
card, dated after the date of your original proxy card, which contains your new instructions, and submit it so that
it is received before the special meeting or, if hand delivered, before the voting takes place at the SONA special
meeting.

The proxies will follow the last voting instructions received from you before the SONA special meeting.

To revoke your proxy card:

Corporate Secretary at Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc., 6830 Old Dominion Drive, McLean, Virginia
22101, and must be received no later than the beginning of the SONA special meeting or, if the special meeting is
adjourned, before the adjourned meeting is actually held. If hand delivered, your new proxy card or notice of
revocation must be received by SONA’s Corporate Secretary before the voting takes place at the special meeting
or at any adjourned meeting.

If you need assistance in changing or revoking your proxy, please contact:

Shares Held in “Street Name.”   If your shares are held in “street name” and you want to change or revoke
voting instructions you have given to the record holder of your shares, you must follow the directions given by
your bank, broker, custodian or nominee.

Solicitation of Proxies

This solicitation is made on behalf of the SONA board of directors, and SONA will pay the costs of
soliciting and obtaining proxies, including the cost of reimbursing banks and brokers for forwarding proxy
materials to shareholders. Proxies may be solicited, without extra compensation, by SONA’s officers and
employees by mail, electronic mail, telephone, fax or personal interviews. SONA has currently engaged
MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist it in the distribution and solicitation of proxies for a fee of  $7,500, plus out-of-
pocket expenses. SONA will also reimburse brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their
expenses in sending these materials to you and getting your voting instructions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROPOSALS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SONA SPECIAL MEETING

Approval of the SONA Merger Proposal (SONA Proposal No. 1)

At the SONA special meeting, shareholders of SONA will be asked to approve the SONA merger proposal
providing for the merger of EVBS with and into SONA. Shareholders of SONA should read this joint proxy
statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety, including the appendices, for more detailed information
concerning the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix A.

After careful consideration, the SONA board of directors approved the merger agreement and the merger to
be advisable and in the best interests of SONA and the shareholders of SONA. See “The Merger — SONA’s
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of SONA’s Board of Directors” included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus for a more detailed discussion of the SONA board of directors’ recommendation.

The SONA board of directors unanimously recommends that SONA shareholders vote “FOR” the
SONA merger proposal.

Approval of the SONA Compensation Proposal (SONA Proposal No. 2)

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c)
of the Exchange Act, at the SONA special meeting, shareholders of SONA will be asked to approve, on a non-
binding advisory basis, the compensation of SONA’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the merger as disclosed in the section entitled “The Merger — Interests of SONA Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation,” beginning on page 74. The non-binding
advisory proposal gives SONA shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related
compensation of SONA’s named executive officers. Accordingly, SONA is requesting that its shareholders adopt
the following resolution, on a non-binding advisory basis:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to SONA’s named executive
officers in connection with the merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such
compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-
K in “The Merger — Interests of SONA Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute
Compensation,” are hereby APPROVED.”

The vote regarding this non-binding advisory proposal on SONA merger-related compensation is a vote
separate and apart from the vote to approve the SONA merger proposal. Accordingly, SONA’s shareholders may
vote to approve the SONA merger proposal and vote not to approve the SONA compensation proposal and vice
versa. Because the vote regarding the SONA compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on
either SONA or, following completion of the merger, the combined company. Accordingly, if the merger is
approved and completed, SONA’s named executive officers will be eligible to receive the various merger-related
compensation that may become payable in connection with the completion of the merger, subject only to the
conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of the SONA
shareholders.

The SONA board of directors unanimously recommends that SONA shareholders vote “FOR” the
SONA compensation proposal.

Approval of the SONA Adjournment Proposal (SONA Proposal No. 3)

If at the SONA special meeting there are not sufficient votes to approve the SONA merger proposal, the
meeting may be adjourned to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of
proxies to approve the SONA merger proposal. In that event, SONA shareholders will be asked to vote on the
SONA adjournment proposal, may be asked to vote on the SONA compensation proposal, and will not be asked
to vote on the SONA merger proposal.

In order to allow proxies that have been received by SONA at the time of the SONA special meeting to be
voted for the SONA adjournment proposal, SONA is submitting the SONA adjournment proposal to its
shareholders as a separate matter for their consideration. This proposal asks SONA shareholders to

authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the SONA board of directors on a discretionary basis to vote in
favor of adjourning the SONA special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from SONA shareholders who have previously voted.

If it is necessary to adjourn the SONA special meeting, then, unless the meeting will have been adjourned
for a total of more than 120 days, no notice of the date, time, place or purpose of such adjourned meeting is
required to be given to shareholders, other than an announcement at the SONA special meeting prior to such
adjournment. Even if a quorum is not present, shareholders who are represented at a meeting may approve an
adjournment of the meeting.

The SONA board of directors unanimously recommends that SONA shareholders vote “FOR” the
SONA adjournment proposal.

THE EVBS SPECIAL MEETING

Date, Place and Time

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is first being mailed on or about May 15, 2017 to EVBS common
shareholders who held shares of EVBS common stock, par value $2.00 per share, on April 24, 2017, the record
date for the EVBS special meeting of common shareholders. This joint proxy statement/ prospectus is
accompanied by the notice of the special meeting and a form of proxy that is solicited by the EVBS board of
directors for use at the special meeting to be held on Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 3:00 p.m. local time, at
International Country Club, located at 13200 Lee Jackson Highway, Fairfax, Virginia 22033, and at any
adjournments of that meeting.

Purposes of the EVBS Special Meeting

At the special meeting, the common shareholders of EVBS will be asked:

Recommendation of the EVBS Board of Directors

The EVBS board of directors believes that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including the merger of EVBS with and into SONA, are advisable and in the best interests of
EVBS and its shareholders and unanimously recommends that EVBS common shareholders vote “FOR” each of
the proposals that will be presented at the EVBS special meeting as described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Record Date and Voting Rights; Quorum

The EVBS board of directors has fixed the close of business on April 24, 2017 as the record date for
determining the common shareholders of EVBS entitled to notice of and to vote at the EVBS special meeting or
any adjournments thereof. Accordingly, you are only entitled to notice of and to vote at the EVBS special
meeting if you were a record holder of EVBS common stock at the close of business on the record date. At that
date, 13,117,393 shares of EVBS common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote.

To have a quorum that permits EVBS to conduct business at the EVBS special meeting, the presence,
whether in person or by proxy, of the holders of EVBS’s common stock representing a majority of the voting
shares outstanding on the record date is required. You are entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of EVBS
common stock you held as of the close of business on the record date.

Holders of shares of EVBS common stock present in person at the special meeting but not voting, and shares
of EVBS common stock for which proxy cards are received indicating that their holders have abstained, will be
counted as present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum for transacting
business. Shares held in “street name” that have been designated by brokers on proxies as not voted will not be
counted as votes cast for or against any proposal and will not be counted for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum unless the broker has been instructed to vote on at least one of the proposals for the EVBS
special meeting.

Votes Required

Vote Required for Approval of the EVBS Merger Proposal.   The approval of the EVBS merger proposal
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of EVBS common stock outstanding on the record date
for the EVBS special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast on the proposal. Because,
however, approval of the EVBS merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
EVBS common stock outstanding on the record date for the special meeting, failures to vote, abstentions and
broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against the EVBS merger proposal.

Vote Required for Approval, on an Advisory Basis Only, of the EVBS Compensation Proposal.   The
approval, on an advisory basis only, of the EVBS compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of EVBS common stock voted on the proposal.

Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast and will have no effect for
purposes of determining whether the EVBS compensation proposal has been approved.

The vote regarding this non-binding advisory proposal on EVBS merger-related compensation is a vote
separate and apart from the vote to approve the EVBS merger proposal. Accordingly, EVBS’s common
shareholders may vote to approve the EVBS merger proposal and vote not to approve the EVBS compensation
proposal and vice versa. Because the vote regarding the EVBS compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not
be binding on either EVBS or, following completion of the merger, the combined company. Accordingly, if the
merger is approved and completed, EVBS’s named executive officers will be eligible to receive the various
merger-related compensation that may become payable in connection with the completion of the merger, subject
only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of the
EVBS common shareholders.

Vote Required for Approval of the EVBS Adjournment Proposal.   The approval of the EVBS adjournment
proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of EVBS common stock voted on the proposal,
whether or not a quorum is present.

Failures to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast and will have no effect for
purposes of determining whether the EVBS adjournment proposal has been approved.

Stock Ownership of EVBS Executive Officers and Directors

Each director and executive officer of EVBS has entered into an agreement with SONA and EVBS pursuant
to which he or she has agreed to vote all of his or her shares in favor of the EVBS merger proposal, subject to
certain exceptions, including that certain shares they hold in a fiduciary capacity or for which they do not have
sole voting or dispositive power are not covered by the agreement. As of the record date, directors and executive
officers of EVBS and their affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote approximately 580,659 shares
of EVBS common stock at the EVBS special meeting, or approximately 4.43% of the total voting power of
shares of EVBS common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, of which 538,935 shares or 4.11% of the
total voting power of the shares of EVBS common stock outstanding on that date are subject to an affiliate
agreement.

Stock Ownership of Certain EVBS Shareholders

SONA and EVBS entered into a voting agreement and election of consideration with each of Castle Creek
and GCP pursuant to which each of Castle Creek and GCP has agreed to vote all shares of EVBS common stock
and EVBS preferred stock beneficially owned by it in favor of the merger. As of the record date, Castle Creek
and GCP beneficially owned and were entitled to vote 1,061,225 shares and 1,122,756 shares, respectively, of
EVBS common stock at the EVBS special meeting, or 8.09% and 8.56%, respectively, of the total voting power
of shares of EVBS common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. As of the record date, Castle Creek and
GCP beneficially owned 4,048,670 shares and 1,191,522 shares, respectively, of EVBS preferred stock,
constituting 77.3% and 22.7%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of EVBS preferred stock. Castle Creek and
GCP, in their capacities as holders of EVBS preferred stock, have consented to the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Voting at the EVBS Special Meeting

Record Holders.   If your shares of EVBS common stock are held of record in your name, your shares can
be voted at the EVBS special meeting in any of the following ways:

By Mail.   You can vote your shares of EVBS common stock by using the proxy card that is enclosed for
your use in connection with the special meeting. If you complete and sign the proxy card and return it in the
enclosed postage-paid envelope, you will be appointing the “proxies” named in the proxy card to vote your shares
for you at the special meeting. The authority you will be giving the proxies is described in the proxy card. When
your proxy card is returned properly executed, the shares of EVBS common stock represented by it will be voted
at the EVBS special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy card.

If proxy cards are returned properly executed without an indication as to how the proxies should vote, the
EVBS common stock represented by each such proxy card will be considered to be voted (i) “FOR” the EVBS
merger proposal, (ii) “FOR” the EVBS compensation proposal and (iii) “FOR” the EVBS adjournment proposal.

By the Internet or Telephone.   You can appoint the proxies to vote your shares of EVBS common stock
for you by going to the Internet website (www.voteproxy.com) or by calling 1-800-PROXIES (1-800-776-9437).
When you are prompted for your “control number,” enter the number printed just above your name on the
enclosed proxy card, and then follow the instructions provided. You may vote by the Internet or telephone only
until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 20, 2017.

If you vote by the Internet or telephone, you need not sign and return a proxy card. Under Virginia law, you
will be appointing the proxies to vote your shares on the same terms as are described above and with the same
authority as if you completed, signed and returned a proxy card. The authority you will be giving the proxies is
described in the proxy card.

In Person.   You can attend the EVBS special meeting and vote in person. A ballot will be provided for your
use at the meeting.

Your vote is important. Accordingly, please sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card, or follow
the instructions above to vote by the Internet or telephone, whether or not you plan to attend the EVBS
special meeting in person.

Shares Held in “Street Name.”   Only the record holders of shares of EVBS common stock, or their
appointed proxies, may vote those shares. As a result, if your shares of EVBS common stock are held for you in
“street name” by a broker or other nominee, such as a bank or custodian, then only your broker or nominee (i.e.,
the record holder) may vote them for you, or appoint the proxies to vote them for you, unless you previously have
made arrangements for your broker or nominee to assign its voting rights to you or for you to be recognized as
the person entitled to vote your shares. You will need to follow the directions your broker or nominee provides
you and give it instructions as to how it should vote your shares by following the instructions you received from
your broker or nominee with your copy of this joint proxy statement/ prospectus. Brokers and other nominees who
hold shares in “street name” for their clients typically have the discretionary authority to vote those shares on
“routine” proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners of the shares. However, they
may not vote those shares on “non-routine” matters, such as the proposals that will be presented at the EVBS
special meeting, unless their clients give them voting instructions. To ensure that your shares are represented at
the EVBS special meeting and voted in the manner you desire, it is important that you instruct your broker or
nominee as to how it should vote your shares.

If your shares are held in “street name” and you wish to vote them in person at the EVBS special meeting,
you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record.

Revocation of Proxies

Record Holders.   If you are the record holder of shares of EVBS common stock and you sign and return a
proxy card or appoint the proxies by the Internet or by telephone and you later wish to revoke the authority or
change the voting instructions you gave the proxies, you can do so at any time before the voting takes place at the
EVBS special meeting by taking the appropriate action described below.

• you can complete, sign and submit a new proxy card, dated after the date of your original proxy card,
which contains your new instructions, and submit it so that it is received before the special meeting or,
if hand delivered, before the voting takes place at the EVBS special meeting; or

• if you appointed the proxies by the Internet or telephone, you can go to the same Internet website
(www.voteproxy.com), or use the same telephone number (1-800-PROXIES) before 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Time on June 20, 2017, enter the control number (printed on the enclosed proxy card) that you
previously used to appoint the proxies, and then change your voting instructions.

• you can give EVBS’s Corporate Secretary a written notice, before the EVBS special meeting or, if hand
delivered, before the voting takes place at the EVBS special meeting, that you want to revoke your
proxy card or Internet or telephone appointment; or

• you can attend the EVBS special meeting and vote in person or notify EVBS’s Corporate Secretary,
before the voting takes place, that you want to revoke your proxy card or Internet or telephone
appointment. Simply attending the special meeting alone, without voting in person or notifying EVBS’s
Corporate Secretary, will not revoke your proxy card or Internet or telephone appointment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

To change the voting instructions you gave the proxies:

The proxies will follow the last voting instructions received from you before the EVBS special meeting.

To revoke your proxy card or your appointment of the proxies by the Internet or telephone:

If you submit your new proxy card or notice of revocation by mail, it should be addressed to EVBS’s
Corporate Secretary at Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc., 10900 Nuckols Road, Suite 325, Glen Allen, Virginia
23060, and must be received no later than the beginning of the EVBS special meeting or, if the special meeting is
adjourned, before the adjourned meeting is actually held. If hand delivered, your new proxy card or notice of
revocation must be received by EVBS’s Corporate Secretary before the voting takes place at the special meeting
or at any adjourned meeting.

If you need assistance in changing or revoking your proxy, please contact EVBS’s Corporate Secretary by
calling (804) 443-8400 or by writing to Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc., 10900 Nuckols Road, Suite 325, Glen

your bank, broker, custodian or nominee.

Solicitation of Proxies

This solicitation is made on behalf of the EVBS board of directors, and EVBS will pay the costs of soliciting
and obtaining proxies, including the cost of reimbursing banks and brokers for forwarding proxy materials to
shareholders. Proxies may be solicited, without extra compensation, by EVBS’s officers and employees by mail,
electronic mail, telephone, fax or personal interviews. EVBS will also reimburse brokers and other custodians,
nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses in sending these materials to you and getting your voting instructions.

PROPOSALS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE EVBS SPECIAL MEETING

Approval of the EVBS Merger Proposal (EVBS Proposal No. 1)

At the EVBS special meeting, common shareholders of EVBS will be asked to approve the EVBS merger
proposal providing for the merger of EVBS with and into SONA. Shareholders of EVBS should read this joint
proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety, including the appendices, for more detailed information
concerning the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Appendix A.

After careful consideration, the EVBS board of directors approved the merger agreement and the merger to
be advisable and in the best interests of EVBS and the shareholders of EVBS. See “The Merger — EVBS’s
Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of EVBS’s Board of Directors” included elsewhere in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus for a more detailed discussion of the EVBS board of directors’ recommendation.

The EVBS board of directors unanimously recommends that EVBS common shareholders vote
“FOR” the EVBS merger proposal.

Approval of the EVBS Compensation Proposal (EVBS Proposal No. 2)

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c)
of the Exchange Act, at the EVBS special meeting, common shareholders of EVBS will be asked to approve, on a
non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of EVBS’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the merger as disclosed in the section entitled “The Merger — Interests of EVBS Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation,” beginning on page 83. The non-binding
advisory proposal gives EVBS common shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related
compensation of EVBS’s named executive officers. Accordingly, EVBS is requesting that its common
shareholders adopt the following resolution, on a non-binding advisory basis:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to EVBS’s named executive
officers in connection with the merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such
compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-
K in “The Merger — Interests of EVBS Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute
Compensation,” are hereby APPROVED.”

The vote regarding this non-binding advisory proposal on EVBS merger-related compensation is a vote
separate and apart from the vote to approve the EVBS merger proposal. Accordingly, EVBS’s common
shareholders may vote to approve the EVBS merger proposal and vote not to approve the EVBS compensation
proposal and vice versa. Because the vote regarding the EVBS compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not
be binding on either EVBS or, following completion of the merger, the combined company. Accordingly, if the
merger is approved and completed, EVBS’s named executive officers will be eligible to receive the various
merger-related compensation that may become payable in connection with the completion of the merger, subject
only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of the
EVBS common shareholders.

The EVBS board of directors unanimously recommends that EVBS common shareholders vote
“FOR” the EVBS compensation proposal.

Approval of the EVBS Adjournment Proposal (EVBS Proposal No. 3)

If at the EVBS special meeting there are not sufficient votes to approve the EVBS merger proposal, the
meeting may be adjourned to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to permit further solicitation of
proxies to approve the EVBS merger proposal. In that event, EVBS common shareholders will be asked to vote
on the EVBS adjournment proposal, may be asked to vote on the EVBS compensation proposal, and will not be
asked to vote on the EVBS merger proposal.

In order to allow proxies that have been received by EVBS at the time of the EVBS special meeting to be
voted for the EVBS adjournment proposal, EVBS is submitting the EVBS adjournment proposal to its common
shareholders as a separate matter for their consideration. This proposal asks EVBS common

shareholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the EVBS board of directors on a discretionary
basis to vote in favor of adjourning the EVBS special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of
soliciting additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from EVBS common shareholders who have
previously voted.

If it is necessary to adjourn the EVBS special meeting, then, unless the meeting will have been adjourned for
a total of more than 120 days, no notice of the date, time, place or purpose of such adjourned meeting is required
to be given to EVBS common shareholders, other than an announcement at the EVBS special meeting prior to
such adjournment. Even if a quorum is not present, shareholders who are represented at a meeting may approve
an adjournment of the meeting.

The EVBS board of directors unanimously recommends that EVBS common shareholders vote
“FOR” the EVBS adjournment proposal.

THE MERGER

The following discussion contains certain information about the merger. The discussion is subject to and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and incorporated herein by reference. We urge you to read carefully this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the merger agreement attached as Appendix A, for a more complete
understanding of the merger.

General Information

The SONA board of directors and the EVBS board of directors have each unanimously approved the merger
agreement and the merger, which provides for the merger of EVBS with and into SONA.

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, as a result of the merger, each share of EVBS common stock
issued and outstanding before the merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.6313 shares of common
stock of the Continuing Corporation. We sometimes refer to this as the “exchange ratio.” The exchange ratio is
fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the effective date of the merger. No fractional
shares will be issued; instead cash will be paid for fractional shares. Upon the effective date of the merger, SONA
common stock, including the shares issued to former holders of EVBS common stock, will be the common stock
of the Continuing Corporation. Each share of the EVBS preferred stock issued and outstanding before the merger
will be converted into the right to receive 0.6313 shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation.

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, SONA expects that it will issue approximately
11,694,700 shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation to the holders of EVBS common and EVBS
preferred stock in the merger. At the completion of the merger, it is expected that there will be issued and
outstanding approximately 24,024,743 shares of SONA common stock, with current SONA shareholders owning
approximately 51.4% of SONA’s outstanding common stock and former holders of EVBS common and EVBS
preferred stock owning approximately 48.6% of SONA’s outstanding common stock.

After the merger, it is expected that EVB, the Virginia chartered bank subsidiary of EVBS, will merge with
and into Sonabank, the Virginia chartered bank subsidiary of SONA. Sonabank will be the surviving bank in the
subsidiary bank merger, which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2017.

Background of the Merger

The boards of directors and senior management teams of SONA and EVBS have, from time to time,
independently engaged in long term strategic reviews as part of their ongoing duties to improve their respective
banking franchises and enhance shareholder value. These reviews have included assessments of opportunities for
growth and increasing earnings organically and through acquisitions of other banks, as well as the possibility of a
strategic business combination or merger of equals with another banking institution or an outright sale of the
bank. These reviews and evaluations took into account the banking industry and operating environment,
competitive landscape, performance history and expected future performance, and have included periodic
discussions concerning potential transactions and operating strategies and their associated risks and benefits.

During the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, Georgia Derrico, chairman and chief
executive officer of SONA, and Roderick Porter, president and vice chairman of SONA, had a series of
discussions with Joe Shearin, president and chief executive officer of EVBS, regarding a potential combination of
the two companies. At the time, primarily due to certain market conditions and concerns regarding the banking
regulatory environment, discussions did not result in any formal proposals and the two parties agreed to
discontinue discussions regarding a possible transaction.

In the ensuing years, Ms. Derrico and Mr. Porter continued to communicate with Mr. Shearin at industry
events and for other business purposes. In May 2015, both SONA and EVBS purchased a portion of the equity of
Southern Trust Mortgage (STM) from another Virginia-based financial institution. As a result of this transaction,
Messrs. Porter and Shearin were named to the board of directors of STM. As members of the board of directors
of STM, Messrs. Porter and Shearin would routinely interact with each other and discuss conditions in their
respective banking markets and the banking regulatory environment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Periodically, Ms. Derrico and Mr. Porter met with representatives from FIG Partners, SONA’s financial
advisor, to discuss the current state of the merger and acquisitions market for the banking industry. During one
such discussion in June 2016, a number of potential targets or strategic partners were discussed.

In August 2016, Messrs. Porter and Shearin and Ms. Derrico discussed the possible combination of SONA
and EVBS and all parties agreed that a merger of equals between the two companies could have mutual appeal
given the perceived benefits from the combined balance sheet, the complementary nature of SONA’s and EVBS’s
businesses, growth opportunities for the combined company, and complementary geographic footprints.

On September 12, 2016, a meeting was held at the offices of Sander O’Neill between Mr. Shearin and
representatives of Sandler O’Neill and EVBS’ two largest shareholders. At the meeting, Sandler O’Neill
presented information regarding EVBS’ strategic options including remaining independent or completing an
acquisition, a strategic merger or a sale transaction. Sandler O’Neill also discussed EVBS’s operating
performance relative to peers and EVBS’s internal operating expectations as well as the current merger
environment for the banking industry.

On September 20, 2016, SONA instructed FIG Partners to contact EVBS’ investment banking representative
at Sandler O’Neill. On September 29, 2016, SONA and EVBS executed a mutual non-disclosure agreement in
order to facilitate the exchange of information in connection with a potential transaction.

In the ensuing weeks, SONA and EVBS, along with their respective representatives from FIG Partners and
Sandler O’Neill, held numerous discussions regarding the potential combination of the two companies. These
discussions focused on the organizational structure of the combined organization, including the location of the
combined company’s and bank’s headquarters, the combined company’s management, potential synergies,
balance sheet composition, combined earnings and pro forma ownership. Based on these discussions, the parties
prepared a preliminary term sheet outlining the material aspects of a merger between SONA and EVBS,
including a potential range of relative pro forma ownership in the Continuing Corporation for legacy SONA and
EVBS shareholders.

On October 20, 2016, the preliminary term sheet was presented to the respective boards of directors of
SONA and EVBS at their regular monthly meetings. At the EVBS board of directors meeting, representatives of
Sandler O’Neill provided an overview of the SONA franchise, including financial and stock price performance,
the recent market for mergers and acquisitions generally, and the potential financial characteristics of a
combination with SONA. Both boards of directors approved the continuation of discussions between the parties
and the start of more formal and in-depth due diligence, including a detailed credit review by SONA and EVBS
of the other party’s loan portfolio.

Beginning on November 1, 2016, comprehensive financial and organizational information was exchanged
between the parties. Reviews, discussions and meetings by or between SONA and EVBS personnel took place
remotely and in person.

On November 3, 2016 EVBS’s board of directors held its regularly scheduled annual board retreat.
Representatives of Sandler O’Neill were present and updated the board on the status of negotiations with SONA.
Sandler O’Neill also provided an update on the financial aspects of the merger. In addition, Sandler O’Neill
discussed EVBS’s strategic options including remaining independent or completing an acquisition, a strategic
merger or a sale transaction. Sandler O’Neill also discussed EVBS’s operating performance relative to peers as
well as the current merger environment for the banking industry.

On November 14, 2016, Ms. Derrico and Messrs. Porter and Shearin and representatives from FIG Partners
and Sandler O’Neill held a conference call in order to facilitate loan file credit reviews by each of SONA and
EVBS with respect to the other’s loan portfolio. These reviews commenced on November 15, 2016, were
conducted both remotely and in person and were completed by November 22, 2016. During the discussions on
November 14, 2016, SONA also informed EVBS that they had asked their legal representatives at Alston & Bird
to begin drafting a definitive merger agreement, a draft of which was initially circulated to all parties on
November 18, 2016.

On November 28, 2016, a meeting was held at the offices of EVBS’s legal advisor, Troutman Sanders, with
representatives from SONA, EVBS, FIG Partners, Sandler O’Neill, Alston & Bird and Troutman

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Sanders present to discuss the initial results of due diligence, the draft of the merger agreement and select
business and financial matters related to the transaction.

Over the course of the following two weeks, Alston & Bird and Troutman Sanders, with the direction and
consultation of their respective clients, as well as input from FIG Partners and Sandler O’Neill, negotiated the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement. Additionally, Ms. Derrico and Messrs. Porter and Shearin, with
counsel from Alston & Bird and Troutman Sanders, respectively, held discussions regarding the terms and
conditions of the employment agreements for certain employees who would be employed by the combined
company, including their own employment agreements, certain terms set forth in the draft of the merger
agreement and the operation of the combined company post-closing.

On December 7, 2016, EVBS’ board of directors held a meeting to update the board of directors on the
status of negotiations with SONA and deliver a summary of EVBS’s due diligence review. A representative of
Troutman Sanders was present and led a review of the merger agreement, including open items subject to further
negotiation, and related agreements including the post-closing employment agreements. Troutman Sanders also
advised the EVBS board of directors with respect to its fiduciary duties under Virginia law, including a focused
summary of duties in connection with a merger. Representatives of Sandler O’Neill were also present and led a
discussion of the updated financial aspects of the merger and related analyses.

On the morning of December 13, 2016, the board of directors of SONA convened a special meeting at
SONA’s offices in McLean, Virginia to discuss the proposed merger with EVBS and the proposed terms thereof.
Representatives of SONA’s management, FIG Partners and Alston & Bird were also present. Ms. Derrico and Mr.
Porter outlined the status of the discussions and negotiations with EVBS. FIG Partners reviewed the financial
aspects of the proposed merger, including the proposed exchange ratio of 0.6303 and rendered an opinion to the
SONA board of directors to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions
made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by FIG Partners as set
forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to SONA as more fully described
below under the caption “Opinion of SONA’s Financial Advisor.”

Alston & Bird then explained the directors’ fiduciary duties in considering and approving a merger with
EVBS and responded to questions from the directors. Alston & Bird then provided the SONA board of directors
with an overview of the material terms of the proposed merger agreement and the timing and process of the
merger if approved by the SONA board of directors. Alston & Bird also identified the interests of SONA’s
officers and directors in the proposed transaction for consideration by the SONA board of directors.

After further discussion and deliberation, the SONA board of directors determined that it had the appropriate
information upon which to evaluate and conclude that the terms of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, were fair to and in the best interests of SONA and
its stockholders and based on such determination, unanimously approved the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. The SONA board of directors
authorized the execution and delivery of the merger agreement and directed that the merger agreement be
submitted to SONA’s stockholders for adoption and approval with the recommendation that such stockholders
vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger agreement and the plan of merger.

On December 13, 2016, EVBS held a special meeting of its board of directors to consider the proposed
merger, the merger agreement and related matters. At the meeting, the EVBS board of directors received an
update from management on the status of the negotiations with SONA. Also at the meeting, representatives of
Sandler O’Neill reviewed its financial analysis of the exchange ratio, and delivered to the EVBS board of
directors its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of December 13,
2016, and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in that opinion, the exchange
ratio in the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of EVBS common stock, as more fully
described below under the caption “Opinion of EVBS’s Financial Advisor.” Representatives of Troutman Sanders
discussed with the EVBS board of directors the legal standards applicable to its decisions and actions with
respect to the proposed transaction and reviewed in detail the

community bank under $10 billion in assets;

the challenges and costs associated with becoming a larger financial institution, and the challenges of
the current and prospective economic, regulatory and competitive environments facing SONA and the
financial services industry generally;

• the expectation that the combined company will have increased resources to invest in future growth
opportunities, both organic and acquisitive, in comparison to SONA on a stand-alone basis;

single enterprise;

• the expectation that the combination will enhance geographic, industry and client diversity of the
combined company’s loan and deposit portfolios, as compared to the loan and deposit portfolios of
SONA and EVBS on a stand-alone basis;

• the fact that the merger will result in 47 branch locations covering markets in both Maryland and
Virginia, including the Washington, D.C. and Richmond, Virginia MSAs, markets often cited as having
some of the best demographic and income profiles in the country, characterized by low unemployment,

proposed merger agreement and related agreements, copies of which were delivered to each director before the
date of the meeting. Following these discussions, the EVBS board unanimously approved the merger and
authorized management to finalize the merger agreement, the related plan of merger and all related agreements
and authorized the execution of the finalized merger agreement. The EVBS board of directors further directed
that the merger agreement and plan of merger be submitted to EVBS’s shareholders for adoption and approval
with the recommendation that such shareholders vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the merger
agreement and the plan of merger.

Later that day, SONA and EVBS executed the merger agreement. After the close of the stock market on
December 13, 2016, the proposed merger was publicly announced by SONA and EVBS.

Subsequent to executing the merger agreement on December 13, 2016, management of SONA and EVBS
have approved two amendments to the merger agreement. SONA and EVBS amended the merger agreement
effective March 9, 2017 to reflect feedback received during the regulatory approval process by amending the date
before which a termination may be payable by SONA or EVBS in certain circumstances as set forth in the merger
agreement. SONA and EVBS further amended the merger agreement effective April 5, 2017 to remove all
provisions related to the creation and issuance of a new series of non-voting common stock, as well as the
requirement to obtain the approval of the SONA stockholders of the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation
of SONA to create a new series of non-voting common stock.

SONA’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of SONA’s Board of Directors

In adopting the merger agreement and recommending approval of the SONA merger proposal set forth in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, SONA’s board of directors consulted with members of SONA’s
management and with SONA’s legal, financial, and business advisors, and also considered a number of factors
that the SONA board of directors viewed as supporting its decisions. The principal factors that the SONA board
of directors viewed as supporting its decisions are:

• the expectation that the merger will result in earnings per share accretion to SONA’s shareholders of
more than 15% in 2017 and more than 20% in 2018 (the first full year of operations as a combined
company), tangible book value dilution of less than 5.0% and a tangible book value earn-back period
within two years;

• the retention of leadership from both SONA and EVBS to help facilitate a successful integration;

• the established working relationship between the SONA and EVBS management teams as a result of
their mutual investment in Southern Trust Mortgage;

into account publicly-filed information and the results of SONA’s due diligence review of EVBS,
including a review of approximately 50% of EVBS’s total loans;

• the oral opinion of FIG Partners, delivered on December 13, 2016 to the SONA board of directors and
subsequently confirmed in writing on December 13, 2016, that the merger consideration to be issued
and paid by SONA pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view and as of
the date of the opinion, to SONA; and

including the presentation and analyses underlying FIG Partners’ fairness opinion.

• the proposed governance and management of SONA following the merger;

• the financial and other terms of the proposed transaction as outlined in the merger agreement;

• the market for alternative merger or acquisition candidates and the likelihood and timing of other
strategic transactions;

• the probability and likelihood of timely approvals from regulatory authorities and any expected
conditions associated with approvals;

• the risks and costs associated with integrating EVBS’s business, operations and employees with those
of SONA;

• the risks of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of SONA’s business in
planning for the merger and executing integration plans;

• the risks of not being able to realize all of the anticipated cost savings and operational synergies
between SONA and EVBS and the risk that other anticipated benefits might not be realized;

• the termination fee payable, under certain circumstances, by SONA to EVBS, including the risk that
the termination fee might discourage third parties from proposing an alternate transaction or would
increase the cost of an alternate transaction; and

• the possibility of litigation in connection with the merger.

In addition to considering the factors described above, the SONA board of directors also considered the
following factors:

The preceding discussion of the information and factors considered by SONA’s board of directors is not
intended to be exhaustive, but, rather, includes the material factors considered by it in connection with its
evaluation of the merger. In reaching its determination to approve and adopt the merger agreement and
recommend that SONA’s shareholders approve the SONA merger proposal, SONA’s board of directors did not
quantify, rank or otherwise assign any relative or specific weights to the factors considered in reaching that
determination. In addition, SONA’s board of directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to
whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination.
Moreover, in considering the information and factors described above, individual directors may have given
differing weights to different factors. SONA’s board of directors considered all these factors as a whole, including

connection with the merger, taking into account the 0.6313 exchange ratio) versus the most recent

Opinion of SONA’s Financial Advisor

FIG Partners delivered to SONA’s board of directors its opinion dated December 13, 2016 that, based upon
and subject to the various considerations set forth in its written opinion, the exchange ratio was fair to the
shareholders of SONA from a financial point of view. In requesting FIG Partners’ advice and opinion, no
limitations were imposed by SONA upon FIG Partners with respect to the investigations made or

procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion. The full text of the opinion of FIG Partners, which
describe the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and limitations on the review
undertaken, is attached hereto as Appendix B. SONA shareholders should read this opinion in its entirety.

FIG Partners is a nationally recognized investment banking firm and, as part of its investment banking
business, it values financial institutions in connection with mergers and acquisitions, private placements and for
other purposes. As a specialist in securities of financial institutions, FIG Partners has experience in, and
knowledge of, banks, thrifts and bank and thrift holding companies. SONA’s board of directors selected FIG
Partners to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger on the basis of the firm’s reputation and
expertise in transactions such as the merger.

FIG Partners has provided SONA financial advisory services in connection with the merger and will receive
a fee for its services in an amount equal to 1.0% of the aggregate purchase price, which at the time of the
announcement of the merger was approximately $1.8 million. FIG Partners’ transaction fee is contingent upon the
consummation of the merger. FIG Partners also received $250,000 in connection with rendering a written opinion
to the SONA board of directors as to the fairness of the exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to SONA
shareholders. Further, SONA has agreed to indemnify FIG Partners against any claims or liabilities arising out of
FIG Partners’ engagement by SONA. As part of its investment banking business, FIG Partners is routinely
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
negotiated underwritings, competitive bidding, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking
companies, FIG Partners has experience and knowledge of, the valuation of banking institutions. This opinion has
been reviewed by FIG Partners’ compliance officer consistent with internal policy. FIG Partners provided certain
services to SONA during the prior two years, and received compensation from SONA for such services. FIG
Partners has not had a material relationship with or received compensation from EVBS during the prior two
years.

FIG Partners’ opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange
ratio, and, as such, does not constitute a recommendation to any SONA shareholder as to how the
shareholder should vote at the SONA shareholder meeting. The summary of the opinion of FIG Partners
set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the opinion.

The following is a summary of the analyses performed by FIG Partners in connection with its fairness
opinion. Certain analyses were confirmed in a presentation to the SONA board of directors by FIG Partners. The
summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of either the analyses performed by FIG
Partners in rendering its opinion or the presentation delivered by FIG Partners to the SONA board of directors,
but it does summarize all of the material analyses performed and presented by FIG Partners.

The preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. In arriving at
its opinion, FIG Partners did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but
rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. FIG Partners
may have given various analyses more or less weight than other analyses. Accordingly, FIG Partners believes that
its analyses and the following summary must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses,
without considering all factors, could create an incomplete view of the process underlying the analyses set forth
in its report to the SONA board of directors and its fairness opinion.

In performing its analyses, FIG Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance,
general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of SONA.
The analyses performed by FIG Partners are not necessarily indicative of actual value or actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Such analyses were prepared
solely as part of FIG Partners’ analysis of the fairness of the exchange ratio, from a financial point of view, to
SONA shareholders. The analyses do not purport to be an appraisal or to reflect the prices at which a company
might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities may trade at the present time or at any time in the
future. FIG Partners’ opinion does not address the relative merits of

• certain documents filed with the SEC by SONA and EVBS;

including, among other things, quarterly reports filed by the parties with the FDIC and the Federal
Reserve;

• discussions with members of the senior management of SONA and EVBS for the purpose of reviewing
the future prospects of SONA and EVBS, including financial forecasts related to the respective
businesses, earnings, assets, liabilities and the amount and timing of cost savings (the “Synergies”)
expected to be achieved as a result of the merger;

• the terms of recent merger and acquisition transactions, to the extent publicly available, involving
banks and bank holding companies that we considered relevant; and

the merger as compared to any other business combination in which SONA might engage. In addition, as
described above, FIG Partners’ opinion was one of many factors taken into consideration by the SONA board of
directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement.

During the course of its engagement, and as a basis for arriving at its opinion, FIG Partners reviewed and
analyzed material bearing upon the financial and operating conditions of SONA and EVBS and material prepared
in connection with the merger, including, among other things, the following:

FIG Partners also took into account its assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and
its experience in other transactions as well as its knowledge of the banking industry and its general experience in
securities valuation.

In rendering this opinion, FIG Partners has assumed and relied on, without independent verification, the
accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and representations contained in the materials
provided to it by SONA and EVBS in the discussions with SONA. In that regard, FIG Partners has assumed that
the financial forecasts, including, without limitation, the Synergies and projections have been reasonably
prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently-available information and judgments and estimates of SONA and
EVBS, and that such forecasts will be realized in the amounts and at the times contemplated thereby. We are not
experts in the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowances for
losses with respect thereto and have assumed that such allowances for SONA and EVBS are in the aggregate
adequate to cover such losses. We were not retained to and did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the
properties or facilities of SONA and EVBS. In addition, we have not reviewed individual credit files nor have we
made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of SONA and EVBS or any of their
respective subsidiaries and we were not furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals.

Contribution Analysis

FIG Partners analyzed the relative contribution of SONA and EVBS to the pro forma balance sheet and
income of the combined entity. This analysis excluded purchase accounting adjustments. To perform this
analysis, FIG Partners used historical balance sheet and net income data for SONA and EVBS as of
September 30, 2016. The results of FIG Partners’ analysis are set forth in the following table, which also
compares the results of the analysis with the implied pro forma ownership percentages of SONA’s and EVBS’s
respective shareholders in the combined company:

SONA EVBS

Pro Forma Shares Outstanding 51.4 48.6
Pro Forma Fully Diluted Shares 53.0 47.0
Total Assets 46.3 53.7
Net Loans 49.4 50.6
Total Deposits 47.5 52.5
Tangible Common Equity 49.3 50.7
Net Income (trailing four quarters) 55.7 44.3
Market Capitalization 52.2 47.8

FIG Partners noted that the ownership interest of SONA’s shareholders in the combined company was
generally in line with SONA’s contribution to the balance sheet and income statement of the combined company,
particularly with regard to SONA’s contribution to net income, tangible common equity and market
capitalization.

Pro Forma Financial Impact

FIG Partners compared the estimated future earnings per share (“EPS”) and tangible book value per share
(“TBV”) for SONA as a standalone entity to the future EPS and TBV resulting from the merger. As a baseline,
FIG Partners estimated future EPS and TBV for SONA derived from projections developed by FIG Partners in
consultation with management. FIG Partners also developed estimates of EPS and TBV for the combined
company using assumptions regarding the anticipated cost savings resulting from the merger, estimated purchase
accounting adjustments, estimated merger-related expenses, and standalone financial projections for EVBS, again
developed by FIG Partners with the assistance of management. Then FIG Partners compared the pro forma EPS
and TBV for the combined company with the EPS and TBV for SONA as a standalone entity. This analysis
indicated that the merger should be accretive to SONA’s estimated EPS in 2017 through 2022. The analysis also
suggested that the TBV dilution resulting from the merger should be recovered in less than 2 years through higher
EPS. However, the actual results achieved by SONA following the merger may vary from the projected results,
and the variations may be material.

Comparable Transaction Analysis

FIG Partners reviewed a selected group of comparable “merger of equals” transactions announced between
January 1, 2013 and December 9, 2016 that involved target banks headquartered in the U.S. with total assets
between $500 million and $5.0 billion. For purposes of the analysis, “merger of equals” was defined as
transactions where the pro forma ownership of the target was at least 40% (the “Comparable Transactions”). The
group was limited to targets that were either bank holding companies, commercial banks, or savings banks/thrifts,
and transactions in which pricing was disclosed. This group consisted of the following ten transactions:

FIG Partners calculated the median ratios for the following relevant transaction pricing multiples for the
Comparable Transactions: the multiple of the offer value to the acquired company’s tangible book value; the
multiple of the offer value to the acquired company’s net income for the last twelve months; the multiple of the
offer value to the acquired company’s total assets; and the premium over tangible book value to core deposits.
FIG Partners used these median multiples to estimate the value of EVBS’s common stock by applying each
median multiple to EVBS’s tangible common equity, net income for the twelve months ended September 30,
2016, total assets, and core deposits as of September 30, 2016, respectively. The results of this analysis are as
follows:

(1) Based on SONA shares outstanding of 12,261,643 as of September 30, 2016.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The comparable transactions analysis suggested a range of value of  $7.26 to $10.43 per share of EVBS
common stock, with an average of  $9.51. FIG Partners noted that the implied value of the merger consideration
of  $9.72 per share (the Exchange Ratio multiplied by SONA’s 10 day weighted average price of  $15.39 on
December 12, 2016) was within the range of values suggested by the comparable transaction analysis.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

FIG Partners estimated the value of SONA’s common stock on a standalone basis by calculating the present
value of projected future cash dividends and the present value of the stock price at the end of a four-year period.
The analysis was based on projections developed by FIG Partners with the assistance of management. In order to
estimate the ending stock value, FIG Partners considered a variety of terminal values based on multiples of
tangible book value and multiples of earnings at the end of the four-year period. FIG Partners applied price to
tangible book value multiples ranging from 155% to 195% of SONA’s estimated tangible book value in 2020 and
price to earnings multiples ranging 16 to 20 times SONA’s 2020 estimated earnings to derive two unique terminal
values. The present value of these terminal values were then calculated based on a range of discount rates of 10%
to 14%. The discount rates selected by FIG Partners were intended to reflect different assumptions regarding the
required rates of return for holders of SONA common stock. The present value of the terminal values was then
added to the present value of the dividend stream for 2017 through 2020 to derive a total value based on
discounted cash flows. The two analyses and the underlying assumptions yielded a range of values for SONA’s
common stock as follows.

For comparison, FIG Partners also estimated the value of the common stock of the combined company using
a discounted cash flow analysis by calculating the present value of projected future cash dividends and the
present value of the stock price at the end of the same four-year period. The analysis was based on FIG Partner’s
projections for the combined company, including the impact of cost savings, purchase accounting adjustments,
and merger-related expenses, developed with the assistance of management. FIG Partners applied price to
tangible book value multiples ranging from 180% to 220% of the pro forma estimated tangible book value in
2020 and price to earnings multiples ranging 16 to 20 times the pro forma 2020 estimated earnings to derive two
unique terminal values. The present value of these terminal values were then calculated based on a range of

FIG Partners used publicly available information to compare selected financial information for SONA and
EVBS to a group of financial institutions selected by FIG Partners, using financial information as of the most
recent quarter and market data available on December 6, 2016. The peer group consisted of 15 publicly-traded
commercial banks in Washington D.C., Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia with total assets
between $750 million and $1.5 billion.

No company used as a comparison in the above analysis is identical to SONA or EVBS. The peer analysis
detailed above was used to compare the operating and financial performance of SONA and EVBS to companies
of similar size and in similar operating markets. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not purely
mathematical. Rather, it involves considerations and judgements concerning differences in financial and
operating characteristics of the companies and of the banking environment at the time of the opinion. FIG

common stock was trading at 147.6% of tangible book value, which was also more than the peer group median.

FIG Partners noted that the median ratios of price to tangible book value and price to earnings for the pro
forma peer group were 201.6% and 21.3x, respectively. FIG Partners observed that the pro forma peer group was
trading at higher multiples of price to tangible book value and price to earnings than the standalone peer group.
FIG Partners also noted that the multiple of price to tangible book value for the pro forma combined company
would have been 176.1% and the multiple of earnings for the combined bank would have been only 14.6x
including the full benefit of anticipated cost savings and purchase accounting adjustments. Both pro forma
pricing ratios were well below the median pricing ratios for the pro forma peer group.

As described above, based upon the foregoing analyses and other investigations and assumptions set
forth in its opinion, without giving specific weightings to any one factor or comparison, FIG Partners
determined that the exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to SONA’s shareholders. FIG
Partners’ opinion and presentation to the SONA board of directors were among the many factors taken
into consideration by the SONA board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger, and
to recommend that SONA shareholders approve the merger.

Opinion of EVBS’s Financial Advisor

EVBS retained Sandler O’Neill, to act as financial advisor to EVBS’s board of directors in connection with
EVBS’s consideration of a possible business combination. Sandler O’Neill is a nationally recognized investment
banking firm whose principal business specialty is financial institutions. In the ordinary course of its investment
banking business, Sandler O’Neill is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions.

Sandler O’Neill acted as financial advisor in connection with the proposed transaction and participated in
certain of the negotiations leading to the execution of the merger agreement. At the December 13, 2016 meeting
at which EVBS’s board of directors considered and discussed the terms of the merger agreement and the merger,
Sandler O’Neill delivered to EVBS’s board of directors its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in
writing on December 13, 2016, to the effect that, as of such date, the exchange ratio provided for in the merger
agreement was fair to the holders of EVBS common stock from a financial point of view. The full text of
Sandler O’Neill’s opinion is attached as Appendix C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The opinion
outlines the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations
on the review undertaken by Sandler O’Neill in rendering its opinion. The description of the opinion set
forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Holders of EVBS common
stock are urged to read the entire opinion carefully in connection with their consideration of the proposed
merger.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was directed to
EVBS’s board of directors in connection with its consideration of the merger agreement and the merger
and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of EVBS as to how any such shareholder
should vote at any meeting of shareholders called to consider and vote upon the approval of the merger
agreement and the merger. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was directed only to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the exchange ratio to the holders of EVBS common stock and does not address the
underlying business decision of EVBS to engage in the merger, the form or structure of the merger or any
other transactions contemplated in the merger agreement, the relative merits of the merger as compared to
any other alternative transactions or business strategies that might exist for EVBS or the effect of any
other transaction in which EVBS might engage. Sandler O’Neill did not express any opinion as to the fairness
of the amount or nature of the compensation to be received in the merger by any officer, director or employee of
EVBS or SONA, or any class of such persons, if any, relative to the compensation to be received in the merger by
any other shareholder, including the exchange ratio to be received by the holders of EVBS common stock.
Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was approved by Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion committee.

In connection with its opinion, Sandler O’Neill reviewed and considered, among other things:

• the relative contribution of assets, liabilities, equity and earnings of EVBS and SONA to the combined
entity;

• the publicly reported historical price and trading activity for EVBS Common Stock and SONA
Common Stock, including a comparison of certain stock market information for EVBS Common Stock
and SONA Common Stock and certain stock indices as well as publicly available information for
certain other similar companies, the securities of which are publicly traded;

• a comparison of certain financial information for EVBS and SONA with similar institutions for which
information is publicly available;

• the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the bank and thrift industry on a
nationwide basis, to the extent publicly available;

• the current market environment generally and the banking environment in particular; and

• such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and
market criteria as Sandler O’Neill considered relevant.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Sandler O’Neill also discussed with certain members of the senior management of EVBS the business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects of EVBS and held similar discussions with certain
members of the senior management of SONA regarding the business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects of SONA.

In performing its review, Sandler O’Neill relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial
and other information that was available to and reviewed by it from public sources, that was provided to Sandler
O’Neill by EVBS or SONA or their respective representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by Sandler
O’Neill, and Sandler O’Neill assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering this opinion
without any independent verification or investigation. Sandler O’Neill relied on the assurances of the respective
managements of EVBS and SONA that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would have made
any of such information inaccurate or misleading. Sandler O’Neill had not been asked to and did not undertake an
independent verification of any of such information and did not assume any responsibility or liability for the
accuracy or completeness thereof. Sandler O’Neill did not make an independent evaluation or perform an
appraisal of the specific assets, the collateral securing assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of EVBS
or SONA or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor was Sandler O’Neill furnished with any such evaluations or
appraisals. Sandler O’Neill rendered no opinion or evaluation on the collectability of any assets or the future
performance of any loans of EVBS or SONA. Sandler O’Neill did not make an independent evaluation of the
adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of EVBS or SONA, or of the combined entity after the Merger, and it
did not review any individual credit files relating to EVBS or SONA. Sandler O’Neill assumed, with EVBS’s
consent, that the respective allowances for loan losses for both EVBS and SONA were adequate to cover such
losses and would be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined entity.

In preparing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus median analyst estimates for
EVBS for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated
long-term annual earnings and balance sheet growth rates for EVBS for the years thereafter, as reviewed with and
confirmed by the senior management of EVBS. In addition, Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus
analyst estimates for SONA for the years ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, as well as
estimated long-term annual earnings and balance sheet growth rates for the years thereafter, as provided by the
senior management of SONA and their representatives and as adjusted by the senior management of SONA for
the offer and sale of  $25 million of subordinated notes by SONA with a coupon of 6.5%. Sandler O’Neill also
received and used in its pro forma analyses certain assumptions relating to purchase accounting adjustments, cost
savings and transaction expenses, as provided by the senior management of SONA. With respect to the foregoing
information, the respective senior managements of EVBS and SONA confirmed to Sandler O’Neill that such
information reflected (or, in the case of the publicly available consensus analyst estimates referred to above, were
consistent with) the best currently available estimates and judgments of those respective senior managements as
to the future financial performance of EVBS and SONA, respectively, and the other matters covered thereby, and
Sandler O’Neill assumed that the future financial performance reflected in such information would be

achieved. Sandler O’Neill expressed no opinion as to such information, or the assumptions on which such
information was based. Sandler O’Neill had also assumed that there had been no material change in the
respective assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of EVBS or SONA since the
date of the most recent financial statements made available to it. Sandler O’Neill assumed in all respects material
to its analysis that EVBS and SONA would remain as going concerns for all periods relevant to its analysis.

Sandler O’Neill also assumed, with EVBS’s consent, that (i) each of the parties to the merger agreement
would comply in all material respects with all material terms and conditions of the merger agreement and all
related agreements, that all of the representations and warranties contained in such agreements were true and
correct in all material respects, that each of the parties to such agreements would perform in all material respects
all of the covenants and other obligations required to be performed by such party under such agreements and that
the conditions precedent in such agreements were not and would not be waived, (ii) in the course of obtaining the
necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases with respect to the Merger, no delay,
limitation, restriction or condition would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on EVBS, SONA or the
merger or any related transaction, (iii) the merger and any related transactions would be consummated in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without any waiver, modification or amendment of any
material term, condition or agreement thereof and in compliance with all applicable laws and other requirements,
and (iv) the merger would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Finally, with
EVBS’s consent, Sandler O’Neill relied upon the advice that EVBS received from its legal, accounting and tax
advisors as to all legal, accounting and tax matters relating to the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement. Sandler O’Neill expressed no opinion as to any such matters.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in
effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date thereof. Events occurring after the date thereof
could materially affect Sandler O’Neill’s opinion. Sandler O’Neill has not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm
or withdraw its opinion or otherwise comment upon events occurring after the date thereof. Sandler O’Neill
expressed no opinion as to the trading values of EVBS Common Stock or SONA Common Stock at any time or
what the value of EVBS common stock would be once it is actually received by the holders of EVBS common
stock.

In rendering its opinion, Sandler O’Neill performed a variety of financial analyses. The summary below is
not a complete description of the analyses underlying Sandler O’Neill’s opinion or the presentation made by
Sandler O’Neill to EVBS’s board of directors, but is a summary of all material analyses performed and presented
by Sandler O’Neill. The summary includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully
understand the financial analyses, these tables must be read together with the accompanying text. The
tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process involving subjective judgments as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. The process, therefore, is
not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. Sandler O’Neill believes that its analyses
must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the factors and analyses to be considered without
considering all factors and analyses, or attempting to ascribe relative weights to some or all such factors and
analyses, could create an incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. Also, no company
included in Sandler O’Neill’s comparative analyses described below is identical to EVBS or SONA and no
transaction is identical to the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of comparable companies or transactions involves
complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the
companies and other factors that could affect the public trading values or merger transaction values, as the case
may be, of EVBS and SONA and the companies to which they are being compared. In arriving at its opinion,
Sandler O’Neill did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered. Rather, Sandler
O’Neill made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Sandler
O’Neill did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative) considered
in isolation supported or failed to support its opinion, rather, Sandler O’Neill made its determination as to the
fairness of the exchange ratio on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the
results of all its analyses taken as a whole.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In performing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill also made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, business and economic conditions and various other matters, many of which are beyond the control
of EVBS, SONA and Sandler O’Neill. The analyses performed by Sandler O’Neill are not necessarily indicative
of actual values or future results, both of which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such
analyses. Sandler O’Neill prepared its analyses solely for purposes of rendering its opinion and provided such
analyses to EVBS’s board of directors at its December 13, 2016 meeting. Estimates on the values of companies do
not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or their securities may actually be
sold. Such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty and actual values may be materially different.
Accordingly, Sandler O’Neill’s analyses do not necessarily reflect the value of EVBS common stock or the prices
at which EVBS common stock or SONA common stock may be sold at any time. The analyses of Sandler O’Neill
and its opinion were among a number of factors taken into consideration by EVBS’s board of directors in making
its determination to approve the merger agreement and should not be viewed as determinative of the exchange
ratio or the decision of EVBS’s board of directors or management with respect to the fairness of the merger. The
type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were determined through negotiation between EVBS and
SONA.

Summary of Proposed Exchange Ratio and Implied Transaction Metrics.   Sandler O’Neill reviewed the
financial terms of the proposed Merger. Using the closing price of SONA common stock as of December 12,
2016 of  $15.61 for valuing SONA common stock, Sandler O’Neill calculated an aggregate implied transaction
value of approximately $180.9 million, or an implied transaction price per share of $9.85. Based upon financial
information for EVBS as of or for the last twelve months (“LTM”) ended September 30, 2016 and for the years
ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, based on median consensus analyst estimates, Sandler
O’Neill calculated the following implied transaction metrics:

Transaction Price/Last Twelve Months Earnings Per Share: 21.9
Transaction Price/2016E Earnings Per Share : 23.5
Transaction Price/2017E Earnings Per Share : 20.3
Transaction Price/Tangible Book Value Per Share (As Converted) : 155
Core Deposit Premium : 7.2
One Day Market Premium to December 12, 2016 EVBS Closing Stock Price: 2.8

Contribution Analysis.   Sandler O’Neill reviewed the relative contribution of various balance sheet and
income statement items to be made by EVBS and SONA to the combined entity based on financial information
for both companies as of or for the period ended September 30, 2016 and for the years ending December 31, 2016

Net Present Value Analyses.   Sandler O’Neill performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per
share of EVBS common stock assuming EVBS performed in accordance with publicly available consensus
median analyst estimates for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018,
and estimated long-term annual earnings and balance sheet growth rates for EVBS for the years thereafter, as
reviewed with and confirmed by the senior management of EVBS. To approximate the terminal value of a share
of EVBS common stock at December 31, 2020, Sandler O’Neill applied price to 2020 earnings per share
multiples ranging from 16.0x to 21.0x and price to December 31, 2020 tangible book value per share multiples
ranging from 100% to 225%. The terminal values were then discounted to present values using different discount
rates ranging from 9.0% to 13.0% which were chosen to reflect different assumptions regarding required rates of
return of holders or prospective buyers of EVBS common stock. As illustrated in the following tables, the
analysis indicated an imputed range of values per share of EVBS common stock of  $7.26 to $10.93 when
applying multiples of earnings per share and $5.39 to $13.53 when applying multiples of tangible book value per
share.

13.0 $5.39 $6.64 $7.89 $ 9.14 $10.38 $11.63

Sandler O’Neill also considered and discussed with the EVBS board of directors how this analysis would be
affected by changes in the underlying assumptions, including variations with respect to net income. To illustrate
this impact, Sandler O’Neill performed a similar analysis assuming EVBS’s net income varied from 20% above
projections to 20% below projections. This analysis resulted in the following range of per share values for EVBS
common stock, applying the price to 2020 earnings per share multiples range of 16.0x to 21.0x referred to above
and a discount rate of 12.78%.

Sandler O’Neill also performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of SONA common
stock assuming that SONA performed in accordance with publicly available consensus analyst estimates for the
years ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, as well as estimated long-term annual earnings and
balance sheet growth rates for the years thereafter, as provided by the senior management of SONA and their
representatives and as adjusted by the senior management of SONA for the offer and sale of  $25 million of
subordinated notes by SONA with a coupon of 6.5%. To approximate the terminal value of SONA common stock
at December 31, 2020, Sandler O’Neill applied price to 2020 earnings per share multiples ranging from 16.0x to
21.0x and price to December 31, 2020 tangible book value per share multiples ranging from 100% to 225%. The
terminal values were then discounted to present values using different discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 13.0%
chosen to reflect different assumptions regarding required rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of
SONA common stock. As illustrated in the following tables, the analysis indicated an imputed range of values
per share of SONA common stock of  $12.24 to $18.25 when applying multiples of earnings per share and $8.38
to $20.28 when applying multiples of tangible book value per share.

Sandler O’Neill noted that the net present value analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the
results of such methodology are highly dependent upon the numerous assumptions that must be made, and the
results thereof are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results.

Pro Forma Merger Analysis.   Sandler O’Neill analyzed certain potential pro forma effects of the merger,
assuming the merger closes at the end of the second calendar quarter of 2017. In performing this analysis, Sandler
O’Neill utilized the following information: (i) publicly available consensus median analyst estimates for EVBS
for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated long-
term annual earnings and balance sheet growth rates for EVBS for the years thereafter, as reviewed with and
confirmed by the senior management of EVBS; (ii) publicly available consensus analyst estimates for SONA for
the years ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, as well as estimated long-term annual earnings and
balance sheet growth rates for the years thereafter, as provided by the senior management of SONA and their
representatives and as adjusted by the senior management of SONA for the offer and sale of  $25 million of
subordinated notes by SONA with a coupon of 6.5%; and (iii) certain assumptions relating to purchase
accounting adjustments, cost savings and transaction expenses, as provided by the senior management of SONA.
The analysis indicated that the merger could be accretive to SONA’s earnings per share (excluding one-time
transaction costs and expenses) in the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019
and December 31, 2020, dilutive to SONA’s estimated tangible book value per share at close.

In connection with this analysis, Sandler O’Neill considered and discussed with the EVBS board of directors
how the analysis would be affected by changes in the underlying assumptions, including the impact of final
purchase accounting adjustments determined at the closing of the transaction, and noted that the actual results
achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results and the variations may be material.

Sandler O’Neill’s Relationship.   Sandler O’Neill has acted as EVBS’s financial advisor in connection with
the merger and will receive a fee for its services in an amount equal to 1.25% of the aggregate purchase price,
which fee at the time of announcement was approximately $2.3 million. Sandler O’Neill’s transaction fee is
contingent upon the closing of the merger. Sandler O’Neill also received a $475,000 fee upon rendering its
fairness opinion to the EVBS board of directors, which opinion fee will be credited in full towards the transaction
fee which will become payable to Sandler O’Neill on the day of closing of the merger. EVBS has also agreed to
indemnify Sandler O’Neill against certain claims and liabilities arising out of its engagement and to reimburse
Sandler O’Neill for certain of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its engagement.

In the two years preceding the date of its opinion, Sandler O’Neill provided certain other investment
banking services to EVBS and received fees for such services. Most recently, Sandler O’Neill was engaged to act
as EVBS’s sole placement agent in connection with EVBS’s offer and sale of senior subordinated debt which
occurred in April 2015. Sandler O’Neill did not provide any investment banking services to SONA in the two
years preceding the date of its opinion. In the ordinary course of its business as a broker-dealer, Sandler O’Neill
may purchase securities from and sell securities to EVBS and its affiliates. Sandler O’Neill may also actively
trade the equity and debt securities of EVBS, SONA and their respective affiliates for its own account and for the
accounts of its customers.

Certain Financial Projections

SONA and EVBS do not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future performance, earnings
or other results due to, among other reasons, the significant unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and
estimates. However, in connection with their respective due diligence, SONA’s management provided EVBS and
its financial advisor with, and EVBS’s management provided SONA and its financial advisor with, certain
internal projected financial information. The projected financial information was not prepared or presented with a
view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to projected financial information, but in the view of
SONA’s and EVBS’s management, was prepared and presented on a reasonable basis, reflected the best then-
available estimates and judgments, and presented, to the knowledge and belief of SONA’s and EVBS’s
management, the expected course of action and the expected future financial performance of SONA and EVBS,
respectively. However, at the time FIG Partners and Sandler O’Neill delivered their fairness opinions in
December 2016 to the boards of directors of SONA and EVBS, respectively, FIG Partners and Sandler O’Neill
relied on more current financial information for purposes of and did not use any projected financial information
provided by management of EVBS or SONA (respectively) in their analyses, except for the financial forecasts
(defined below).

In preparing its analysis Sandler O’Neill used estimated long-term annual earnings and balance sheet growth
rates for SONA for the years ended December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2020 (the “financial forecasts”),
as provided to Sandler O’Neill by the senior management of SONA. The financial forecasts are not fact and
should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and the readers of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus should not place undue reliance on the financial forecasts. Neither SONA’s nor EVBS’s
independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any
procedures with respect to the financial forecasts, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of
assurance on such financial forecasts or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any
association with, the financial forecasts.

The financial forecasts are based on numerous variables and assumptions (including but not limited to those
related to industry performance, competition, general business, economic, market and financial conditions) that
are inherently uncertain, are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of SONA. The
financial forecasts are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the impact of general
economic factors outside the control of SONA, volatility in interest rates, economic conditions generally and in
the markets that SONA serves, consumer sentiment, and other risks and uncertainties relating to SONA’s business
(including their ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods) and other factors
described under "Forward-Looking Statements," all of which are subject to change. As a result, actual results may
differ materially from those contained in or implied by the financial forecasts.

The inclusion of the financial forecasts in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an
indication that any of SONA, EVBS, FIG Partners or Sandler O’Neill, or their respective affiliates, officers,
directors, advisors or other representatives consider the financial forecasts to be necessarily predictive of actual
future events, and the financial forecasts should not be relied upon as such. None of SONA, EVBS, FIG Partners
or Sandler O’Neill, or their respective affiliates, officers, directors or other representatives can give you any
assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the financial forecasts, and none of them has any
intent to or undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the financial forecasts to reflect
circumstances existing after the date the financial forecasts were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future
events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the financial forecasts are shown to be in
error.

Furthermore, the financial forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the
date such financial forecasts were prepared. SONA can give no assurance that, had the financial forecasts been
prepared as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, similar estimates and assumptions would be used.
The financial forecasts do not take into account all possible financial and other effects on SONA of the merger
and do not attempt to predict or suggest future results of the combined company. The financial forecasts do not
give effect to the impact of negotiating or executing the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in
connection with consummating the merger, any potential synergies that may be achieved by the combined
company as a result of the merger, the effect of any

been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if
the merger agreement had not been executed, but which were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken
in anticipation of the merger. Further, the financial forecasts do not take into account the effect of any possible
failure of the merger to occur.

None of SONA or its affiliates, officers, directors or other representatives has made or makes any
representation to any shareholder or other person, including EVBS or any of its affiliates, officers, directors or
other representatives, regarding SONA’s ultimate performance compared to the financial forecasts or that the
projected results will be achieved. The financial forecasts are being provided because they were considered by
the SONA board of directors and the EVBS board of directors in adopting the merger agreement and in
authorizing and approving the merger and all other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

The following table presents selected projected financial information of SONA constituting the financial
forecasts:

Projected annual growth rate
for fiscal years 2018 to 2020

Net income 10.0

The financial forecasts set forth above represent the most recent projections prepared by SONA and
delivered to EVBS prior to the announcement of the transaction in December 2016. Readers of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus are urged to review SONA’s and EVBS’ most recent public filings with the SEC for a
description of each company’s results of operations and financial condition during the most recent interim period
and prior year.

Interests of Certain SONA Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendations of the SONA board of directors that SONA shareholders vote in favor

of the SONA merger proposal and the SONA compensation proposal, SONA shareholders should be aware that
SONA directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that differ from, or are in addition to,
their interests as shareholders of SONA. The SONA board of directors was aware of these interests and took
them into account in its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger.

Outstanding Stock Options.   SONA has made periodic grants of stock options to its directors, executive
officers and other employees. The merger will not accelerate the vesting or exercisability of any outstanding and
unvested stock options. All stock options will remain outstanding subject to the same terms and conditions that
are applicable prior to the merger.

Change in Control Agreements.   SONA currently has change in control agreements with each of
Ms. Derrico and Messrs. Porter and Baker. These agreements provide such officers certain lump sum cash
payments in the event the officer’s employment is terminated without cause at any time or if, following a change
in control, such employment is terminated by the executive for “good reason” and the officer signs the form of
mutual general release. Upon a qualifying termination, the executive would receive a lump sum cash payment
equal to a multiple (three times for Ms. Derrico, two times for Mr. Porter and 1.5 times for Mr. Baker) of the sum
of his or her annual base salary and target bonus as set by the SONA board of directors, or if the SONA board of
directors has not set a target bonus, the bonus paid by SONA for the year prior to the year in which termination
occurs. In addition to the cash payment, the executives will receive continuation of health insurance for a period
ending on the earlier of  (x) the date of receipt of comparable benefits from a new employer or (y) 24 months. The
agreement also provides that the executive’s equity awards will become fully-vested. SONA also agreed to pay
the excise tax that may be levied on “excess parachute payments” under Section 4999 of the Code, plus all taxes
on such payments (known as a “gross-up payment”). The merger does not constitute a “change in control” for
purposes of Section 280G of the Code.

A “change in control” as defined under the change in control agreements includes the completion of the
merger. Notwithstanding each of Ms. Derrico’s and Messrs. Porter’s and Baker’s expected continued employment
with the Continuing Corporation, prior to the closing of the merger, SONA intends to enter

equal to a multiple (three times for Ms. Derrico, two times for Mr. Porter and 1.5 times for Mr. Baker) of the
sum of his or her annual base salary the bonus paid by SONA for calendar year 2016. The amounts in the
table reflect base salaries as of April 1, 2017 (Ms. Derrico, $469,577; Mr. Porter, $318,675; and Mr. Baker,
$217,360) and the bonus paid by the Bank for calendar year 2016 (Ms. Derrico, $268,330; Mr. Porter,
$182,100; and Mr. Baker, $6,000). Notwithstanding each of Ms. Derrico’s and Messrs. Porter’s and Baker’s
expected continued employment with the Continuing Corporation, prior to the closing of the merger, SONA
and EVBS intend to enter into termination agreements with each of Ms. Derrico and Messrs. Porter and
Baker, which will provide for termination of the SONA change in control agreements at the effective time of
the merger and payment of the full change in control payment calculated in accordance with the respective
change in control agreement (each, a “single-trigger” payment).

(2) Each of Ms. Derrico and Messrs. Porter and Baker hold unvested stock options. However, the merger does
not constitute a “change in control” as defined in the stock option plan and, accordingly, the merger will not
accelerate the vesting or exercisability of such outstanding and unvested stock options. All stock options
will remain outstanding subject to the same terms and conditions that are applicable prior to the merger.

into termination agreements with each of Ms. Derrico and Messrs. Porter and Baker, which will provide for
termination of the SONA change in control agreements at the effective time of the merger and payment of the full
change in control payment calculated in accordance with the respective change in control agreement, as described
above. The estimated amounts of the change in control payments are provided below under “Interests of Certain
SONA Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation.”

Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreements.   SONA currently has supplemental executive retirement
agreements with each of Ms. Derrico and Mr. Porter (each, a “SONA SERP”). The SONA SERPs provide that if
the executive remains in employment through August 1, 2017, the executive will be entitled to a normal
retirement benefit of ten annual payments of  $213,582 for Ms. Derrico and to $153,964 for Mr. Porter beginning
on the first day of the seventh month following the executive’s separation from service. The executives are 100%
vested in their accrued benefits under the SONA SERPs, and the SONA SERPs do not provide for acceleration of
payment upon a change in control. If the executive’s separation from service follows a change in control, the
executive will receive his or her normal retirement benefit beginning the first day of the seventh month following
the executive’s separation from service. A “change in control” as defined under the SONA SERP includes the
completion of the merger. The estimated incremental amounts of the benefits under the SONA SERP for which
vesting would be accelerated in connection with the merger are provided below under “Interests of Certain
SONA Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation.”

Golden Parachute Compensation.   The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t)
of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC regarding certain compensation which SONA named executive
officers may receive that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger. The amounts are calculated assuming
that the effective date of the merger occurred on April 1, 2017. The merger-related compensation payable to the
SONA named executive officers is the subject of a non-binding advisory vote of SONA shareholders, as
described under “Proposals to be Considered at the SONA Special Meeting — Approval of the SONA
Compensation Proposal (SONA Proposal No. 2)” beginning on page 39.

(3) Amounts listed in this column represent the incremental amount of the benefit under the SONA SERP for
which vesting would be accelerated in connection with the merger (a “single-trigger” benefit). However, the
SONA SERPs do not provide for acceleration of payment in connection with the merger. At April 1, 2017,
each of Ms. Derrico’s and Mr. Porter’s cumulative vested percentage in his or her normal retirement benefit
under the SONA SERP was 69%.

(4) As stated above, SONA has agreed to pay the excise tax that may be levied on “excess parachute payments”
under Section 4999 of the Code, plus all taxes on such payments (known as a “gross-up payment”).
However, the merger is not a ‘change in control” of SONA for purposes of Section 280G of the Code and,
accordingly, the gross-up payment, if any, will not be triggered.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

New Employment Agreements for SONA Named Executive Officers.   In connection with the merger, the
Continuing Corporation will enter into new employment agreements to be effective upon completion of the
merger with Ms. Derrico and Messrs. Porter and Baker. The term of the new employment agreements will
commence as of the effective date of the merger and will terminate on the second anniversary thereof. The new
employment agreements provide for annual salary for each of Ms. Derrico and Messrs. Porter and Baker to be
determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Continuing Corporation, and
participation in such benefit plans, policies, and programs as may be maintained, from time to time, by
Continuing Corporation. If the executive is terminated by SONA without “cause” (as defined in the new
employment agreement) prior to the expiration of the term, then he or she will receive a severance payment equal
to his or her base salary that would have been paid through the expiration of the term, absent his or her
termination of employment, payable in a single lump sum. Ms. Derrico and Mr. Porter also will receive
reimbursement for group health care premiums and will be provided with a personal assistant having a salary not
to exeed $60,000, in each case for two years following termination of employment, and his or her outstanding
options will become fully-vested and exercisable as of the date of such termination. The new employment
agreements contain customary confidentiality covenants, as well as covenants regarding the non-solicitation of
customer and employees and non-competition that apply for twelve months following the executive’s termination
of employment.

Director and Executive Officer Appointments.   At the effective date of the merger, six current directors of
SONA, Georgia S. Derrico, R. Roderick Porter, Neil J. Call, Robert Y. Clagett, W. Bruce Jennings and Charles A.

Eric A. Johnson will become directors of SONA and J. Mikesell Thomas will serve as an observer to the board of
directors of SONA. Each of these directors will also serve as directors of Sonabank. Georgia S. Derrico, the
current chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of SONA, will serve as SONA’s executive
chairman of the board of directors following the effective date of the merger and R. Roderick Porter, the current
president and vice chairman of the board of directors of SONA, will serve as executive vice chairman of the
board of directors. Mr. Shearin, the current president and chief executive officer of EVBS, will serve as president

SONA’s and Sonabank’s executive vice president and chief credit risk officer; and Douglas R. Taylor, the current
executive vice president and chief risk officer of EVBS, will serve as SONA’s and Sonabank’s executive vice
president and chief risk officer.

Interests of Certain EVBS Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
In considering the recommendations of the EVBS board of directors that EVBS shareholders vote in favor of

the EVBS merger proposal and the EVBS compensation proposal, EVBS shareholders should be aware that
EVBS directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that differ from, or are in addition to,
their interests as shareholders of EVBS. The EVBS board of directors was aware of these interests and took them
into account in its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger.

Indemnification and Insurance.   Following the effective date of the merger, SONA has agreed to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless any officer or director of EVBS who has rights to indemnification

from EVBS or any of its subsidiaries to the same extent and on the same conditions as such person was entitled to
indemnification pursuant to applicable law and EVBS’s or its subsidiaries’ organizational documents. SONA has
also agreed to purchase a six year “tail” prepaid policy, on the same terms as EVBS’s existing directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance, for the current officers and directors of EVBS, subject to a cap on the cost of such
policy equal to 300% of the last annual premium paid by EVBS.

Director and Executive Officer Appointments.   At the effective date of the merger, six current directors of
SONA, Georgia S. Derrico, R. Roderick Porter, Neil J. Call, Robert Y. Clagett, W. Bruce Jennings and Charles A.
Kabbash and five current directors of EVBS, Joe A. Shearin, John F. Biagas, W. Rand Cook, F.L. Garrett, III and
Eric A. Johnson will become directors of SONA and J. Mikesell Thomas will serve as an observer to the board of
directors of SONA. Each of these directors will also serve as directors of Sonabank. Georgia S. Derrico, the
current chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of SONA, will serve as SONA’s executive
chairman of the board of directors following the effective date of the merger and R. Roderick Porter, the current
president and vice chairman of the board of directors of SONA, will serve as executive vice chairman of the
board of directors. Mr. Shearin, the current president and chief executive officer of EVBS, will serve as president
and chief executive officer of SONA and Sonabank; Mr. J. Adam Sothen, the current chief financial officer of
EVBS, will serve as SONA’s and Sonabank’s chief financial officer; William H. Lagos, the current executive vice
president and chief financial officer of SONA, will serve as SONA’s and Sonabank’s chief accounting officer;
Thomas P. Baker will serve as SONA’s and Sonabank’s co-chief credit officer; James S. Thomas, the current
executive vice present and chief channel distribution officer of EVBS, will serve as SONA’s and Sonabank’s co-
chief credit officer; William H. Stevens, the current executive vice president, credit of SONA, will serve as
SONA’s and Sonabank’s executive vice president and chief credit risk officer; and Douglas R. Taylor, the current
executive vice president and chief risk officer of EVBS, will serve as SONA’s and Sonabank’s executive vice
president and chief risk officer.

SONA pays non-employee directors a basic cash retainer on a quarterly or monthly basis that is designed to
compensate directors for their participation on the SONA board of directors and the execution of their basic
duties and responsibilities. Non-employee members of the board of directors of SONA received an annual
retainer of  $20,000 each during the first half of 2016 and the chairman of each board committee received an
annual retainer of  $22,000, in each case payable quarterly. Effective for SONA board and committee meetings in
the second half of 2016, non-employee members of the board of directors of SONA receive an annual retainer of 
$25,000 each and the chairman of each board committee receives an annual retainer of  $27,000, in each case
payable quarterly. All of the directors of SONA are also directors of Sonabank. Each non-employee director of
Sonabank receive a fee of  $1,000 and $500 for attendance at Sonabank board meetings and Sonabank board
committee meetings, respectively. Each non-employee director of Sonabank also receives reimbursement for any
travel, food and lodging expenses. Any non-employee directors who attends either Sonabank board or Sonabank
committee meetings by conference telephone receives one-half of the fees for such meetings. Directors who are
also employees of SONA or Sonabank receive no additional compensation for their service as a director. To
encourage stock ownership by its directors, Sonabank maintains a stock matching program pursuant to which it
funds the purchase of additional shares of SONA common stock on behalf of a director in an amount equal to
66% of the shares of SONA common stock otherwise purchased by the director, up to an annual value of $10,000
per director. SONA’s Compensation Committee expects to set basic director compensation for 2017 follwing the
consummation of the merger.

Cash Balance Pension Plan.   In connection with the merger, EVBS will fully fund the VBA Cash Balance
Pension Plan (“EVBS Cash Balance Plan”), fully vest all participants in the benefits provided to them under the
plan, terminate the plan and distribute benefits to participants. Mr. Shearin and Mr. Thomas participate in the
EVBS Cash Balance Plan. No related dollar value is included below under “Interests of Certain EVBS Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation” because each of Mr. Shearin and Mr.
Thomas is currently fully vested in the benefits provided to him under the plan and such benefits will not be
increased or enhanced in connection with the merger.

Outstanding Restricted Stock Awards and Annual Stock Retainer.   EVBS has made periodic grants of
equity awards to its directors, executive officers and other employees. Each share of EVBS common stock
subject to time-based or performance-based vesting restrictions granted under an EVBS equity-based

compensation plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger will, pursuant to the
terms of such grant, vest in full immediately prior to the merger and be converted into unrestricted shares of
SONA common stock based on the exchange ratio. On March 16, 2017, with respect to certain performance-
based restricted stock awards held by six EVBS executive officers (including EVBS named executive officers
Messrs. Shearin, Sothen, Thomas and Taylor) and one other EVBS employee, the vesting of which was
dependent upon 2016 performance, in light of the pending merger and the fact that peer group comparison was
challenging as a result of other recent merger activity within the peer group, the EVBS Compensation Committee
converted such shares of performance-based restricted stock into time-based restricted stock that will vest upon
consummation of the merger. In connection with the merger agreement, SONA has consented to this conversion.
As of April 1, 2017, there were 135,550 outstanding shares of EVBS common stock subject to time-based or
performance-based restrictions held by EVBS executive officers. Non-employee directors of EVBS do not hold
restricted stock that will vest in connection with the merger.

For each EVBS named executive officer, the estimated amount of the value of the accelerated vesting of
outstanding shares of EVBS common stock subject to time-based or performance-based restrictions is provided
below under “Interests of Certain EVBS Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute
Compensation,” which assumes a value of  $10.12 per each unvested share of common stock (which is the
average closing market price of EVBS common stock over the first five business days following the first public
announcement of the merger) and assumes the merger was completed on April 1, 2017. Using the same
assumptions, the value of the accelerated vesting of restricted stock for the three EVBS executive officers who
are not named executive officers (i.e., Bruce T. Brockwell, Dianna B. Emery and Ann-Cabell Williams) as a
group is approximately $320,804 in the aggregate.

EVBS directors and executive officers do not hold any options to purchase shares of EVBS common stock
granted under an EVBS equity-based compensation plan.

As part of the EVBS director compensation program, non-employee directors of EVBS receive annual
retainers in the form of a grant of unrestricted shares of EVBS common stock, with a portion of the annual
retainer paid in cash if elected by the director. EVBS anticipates approving grants of unrestricted shares of
common stock in the aggregate amount of approximately $97,500 to non-employee directors of EVBS on June 1,
2017, with the total number of shares granted based on the closing price of EVBS common stock on the date of
the grant. In connection with the merger agreement, SONA has consented to these grants.

EVBS Employment Agreements with Executive Officers.   EVBS currently has employment agreements
with each of Joe A. Shearin, James S. Thomas and Mark C. Hanna. Upon completion of the merger, Mr. Shearin
will serve as president and chief executive officer of SONA and Sonabank pursuant to the terms of a new
employment agreement that will supersede his current EVBS employment agreement. Upon completion of the
merger, SONA has agreed to assume the employment agreement with each of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Hanna.

The current EVBS employment agreement with Mr. Shearin provides that, if Mr. Shearin resigns for good
reason or his employment is terminated without cause within one year after a change in control, he would be
entitled to certain payments and benefits. In connection with the merger, however, SONA, Sonabank and Mr.
Shearin will enter into a new employment agreement to be effective upon completion of the merger, pursuant to
which Mr. Shearin will serve as president and chief executive officer of SONA and Sonabank upon completion of
the merger as described further below. Upon its effective date, the new employment agreement with Mr. Shearin
will supersede the current EVBS employment agreement. Accordingly, Mr. Shearin will have no rights or
entitlements and will receive no payment or benefit under his current EVBS employment agreement.

SONA has agreed to assume and comply with all obligations, including payment obligations, under the
amended and restated employment agreement between EVBS and Mr. Thomas. The employment agreement with
Mr. Thomas provides that, if Mr. Thomas resigns for good reason or his employment is terminated without cause
within one year after a change in control, he will be entitled to receive termination compensation in an amount
equal to 2.99 times the executive’s five-year average base compensation as defined in Section 280G of the Code.
A portion of this amount is payable in accordance with established

payroll practices for a period following termination, and the balance is payable in a lump sum upon termination,
provided that, in all events, payments may be delayed for six months if required to comply with Section 409A of
the Code. The employment agreement with Mr. Thomas provides that, in all circumstances, any amounts paid by
the company pursuant to the employment agreement will be limited to one dollar less than the maximum amount
deductible under Section 280G of the Code. A “change in control” as defined under the employment agreement
with Mr. Thomas includes the completion of the merger.

SONA has agreed to assume and comply with all obligations, including payment obligations, under the
employment agreement between EVBS and Mr. Hanna. The employment agreement with Mr. Hanna provides
that, if Mr. Hanna resigns for good reason or his employment is terminated without cause within one year after a
change in control, he will be entitled to a lump sum severance payment equal to two times the total of his annual
base salary and most recent annual bonus, if any, on the date of termination, or, if higher, on the date immediately
prior to the change in control, provided, however, that the calculation of Mr. Hanna’s severance payment will
include bonus amounts, if any, only if the company includes such bonus amounts for other members of executive
management at the time of a change in control, and provided further that payment may be delayed for six months
if required to comply with Section 409A of the Code. The employment agreement with Mr. Hanna also provides
that Mr. Hanna will receive the final $50,000 installment of a retention bonus on November 15, 2017, provided
he is employed by EVBS or its successor on that date. The employment agreement with Mr. Hanna provides that,
in all circumstances, any amounts paid by the company pursuant to the employment agreement will be limited to
one dollar less than the maximum amount deductible under Section 280G of the Code. A “change in control” as
defined under the employment agreement with Mr. Hanna includes the completion of the merger.

Under their respective employment agreements, each of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Hanna will generally have
“good reason” to terminate his employment under his employment agreement if the company negatively changes
certain important aspects of the executive’s employment without his consent, including his authority,
responsibility or salary, moves the executive’s principal office outside certain geographical areas, or fails to
comply with any material term of the employment agreement. Good reason to terminate employment would not
exist unless the executive has notified the company of the condition giving rise to good reason and the company
has failed to remedy the condition. Termination for “cause” under the employment agreements would generally
include the executive’s personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, breach of a fiduciary duty
involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule or
regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or a final cease-and-desist order, conviction of a
felony or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, misappropriation of the company’s assets (determined on
a reasonable basis) or those of its subsidiaries or other affiliates, or material breach by the executive of any other
provision of the employment agreement. Under Mr. Hanna’s employment agreement, the company would not
have cause to terminate his employment for an intentional failure to perform stated duties or a material breach of
the employment agreement unless the company has notified Mr. Hanna of the existence of such condition and Mr.
Hanna has failed to remedy the condition.

For each of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Hanna, the estimated amount of the compensation the executive may
receive under his employment agreement that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger is provided below
under “Interests of Certain EVBS Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute
Compensation.” If the payments or benefits to be received by Mr. Thomas or Mr. Hanna would constitute an
“excess parachute payment,” thereby causing the executive to be subject to an excise tax under Section 280G and
Section 4999 of the Code, then the total benefits paid to such executive will be reduced to the extent necessary to
avoid imposition of any such excise taxes. Assuming the merger closed on April 1, 2017, the maximum amount
that could be paid to Mr. Thomas without causing him to be subject to the excise tax described above is estimated
to be $474,708. As a result, Mr. Thomas’s payments and benefits would be reduced to $474,708 to avoid
imposition of the excise tax described above. Assuming the merger closed on April 1, 2017, the value of
payments and benefits received by Mr. Hanna, as calculated for purposes of Section 280G and Section 4999 of
the Code in connection with the merger, would be below his respective Section 280G limit, such that no reduction
would be necessary to avoid the imposition of the excise tax described above.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.   Mr. Shearin and Mr. Hanna currently participate in the EVBS
supplemental executive retirement plan (“EVBS SERP”). SONA has agreed to assume and comply with all
obligations, including payment obligations, under the EVBS SERP. Under the EVBS SERP, the normal
retirement benefit for Mr. Shearin consists of an annual benefit of  $155,000, payable monthly for 15 years, and
the normal retirement benefit for Mr. Hanna consists of a monthly benefit of  $3,333, payable for 200 months.
Under the EVBS SERP, the normal retirement benefit for each of Mr. Shearin and Mr. Hanna will fully vest on
the date of a change in control, although the time of payment is not accelerated. A “change in control” as defined
under the EVBS SERP includes the completion of the merger.

The completion of the merger will not accelerate the time of payment for Mr. Shearin under the EVBS
SERP. Under the EVBS SERP, if Mr. Shearin’s employment terminates on or after the date he attains the normal
retirement age of 67, the payments described above will begin on the first day of the month following termination
of employment. If Mr. Shearin’s employment terminates before the date he attains the normal retirement age of
67, the payments described above will begin on the first day of the month following the later of termination of
employment or the date he attains the age of 62. In all events, payments to Mr. Shearin under the EVBS SERP
may be delayed for six months if required to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

The completion of the merger will not accelerate the time of payment for Mr. Hanna under the EVBS SERP.
Under the EVBS SERP, if Mr. Hanna’s employment terminates after the date he attains the age of 62, the
payments described above will begin on the first day of the month following termination of employment. If Mr.
Hanna’s employment terminates before the date he attains the age of 62, the payments described above will be
made in a lump sum on the first day of the month following the date he attains the age of 62. In all events,
payments to Mr. Hanna under the EVBS SERP may be delayed for six months if required to comply with Section
409A of the Code.

For each of Mr. Shearin and Mr. Hanna, the estimated amount of the benefits the executive may receive
under the EVBS SERP that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger is provided below under “Interests of
Certain EVBS Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation.”

Executive Severance Plan.   The EVBS executive severance plan covers each officer of EVBS and EVB at
the Executive Vice President level or above who does not have an employment agreement with EVBS or EVB.
Currently, Messrs. Sothen, Taylor and Brockwell and Mses. Emery and Williams participate in the EVBS
executive severance plan. SONA has agreed to assume and comply with all obligations, including payment
obligations, under the EVBS executive severance plan and has agreed not to terminate the plan for at least twelve
months following the merger.

In connection with the merger, SONA, Sonabank and Mr. Sothen will enter into a new employment
agreement to be effective upon completion of the merger, pursuant to which Mr. Sothen will serve as chief
financial officer of SONA and Sonabank upon completion of the merger as described further below. Upon its
effective date, the new employment agreement with Mr. Sothen will supersede the EVBS executive severance
plan with respect to Mr. Sothen. Accordingly, Mr. Sothen will have no rights or entitlements and will receive no
payment or benefit under the EVBS executive severance plan.

For Messrs. Taylor and Brockwell and Mses. Emery and Williams, the EVBS executive severance plan
provides severance pay and benefits following certain termination events. Subject to execution, delivery and non-
revocation of a release of claims, the severance pay and benefits under the EVBS executive severance plan
consist of base salary continuation at the rate in effect on the date of termination (the “Severance Salary
Continuation Benefit”) and continued payment of an amount equal to the employer-paid portion of the monthly
medical premium for the participant and his or her covered spouse and dependents on the date of termination, if
the participant elects and receives medical insurance coverage under COBRA following termination of
employment (the “Severance Medical Insurance Benefit”). Under the EVBS executive severance plan, a
participant whose employment is terminated other than for cause within one year following a change in control,
or who experiences a constructive discharge within one year following a change in control, will receive the
Severance Salary Continuation Benefit and the Severance Medical Insurance Benefit for twelve months
following termination of employment. A “change in control” as defined under the EVBS executive severance
plan includes the completion of the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Under the EVBS executive severance plan, a “constructive discharge” would generally occur if the company
materially reduces the executive’s base compensation, authority, duties or responsibility or materially changes the
geographic location of the executive’s office. A constructive discharge would not occur unless the executive has
notified the company of the condition giving rise to the constructive discharge and the company has failed to
remedy the condition. Termination for “cause” under the EVBS executive severance plan would generally include
the executive’s personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, breach of a fiduciary duty involving
personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule or regulation (other
than traffic violations or similar offenses) or a final cease-and-desist order, conviction of a felony or of a
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, misappropriation of the company’s assets (determined on a reasonable
basis) or the bank’s assets, death, or disability as defined in a long-term disability insurance policy maintained by
the company or the bank for the executive’s benefit.

Messrs. Sothen and Taylor are the only participants in the EVBS executive severance plan who are EVBS
named executive officers. As described above, Mr. Sothen will receive no payment or benefit under the EVBS
executive severance plan in connection with the merger. For Mr. Taylor, the estimated amount of the payments
and benefits he may receive under the EVBS executive severance plan that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger is provided below under “Interests of Certain EVBS Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger —
Golden Parachute Compensation.” Using the same assumptions, the estimated amount of the payments and
benefits Mr. Brockwell and Mses. Emery and Williams as a group may receive under the EVBS executive
severance plan is approximately $498,793 in the aggregate.

New SONA Employment Agreement with Mr. Shearin.   In connection with the merger, SONA, Sonabank
and Mr. Shearin will enter into a new employment agreement to be effective upon completion of the merger,
pursuant to which Mr. Shearin will serve as president and chief executive officer of SONA and Sonabank upon
completion of the merger. Upon its effective date, the new employment agreement with Mr. Shearin will
supersede the current EVBS employment agreement. Accordingly, Mr. Shearin will have no rights or entitlements
and will receive no payment or benefit under his current EVBS employment agreement.

The new employment agreement with Mr. Shearin will have an initial term that expires on December 31,
2020, subject to automatic two-year renewals unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal no later
than ninety days before any renewal date. The new employment agreement provides for an annual base salary to
be determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Continuing Corporation and
eligibility for equity awards and annual bonuses and certain other benefits, including continued participation in
the EVBS SERP, payment of private club dues and use of an automobile at the company’s expense. The new
employment agreement also provides that any incentive compensation paid to Mr. Shearin, including both equity
and cash incentive compensation, is subject to repayment or clawback as further described in the agreement.

Under the new employment agreement with Mr. Shearin, Mr. Shearin’s employment may be terminated by
SONA or Sonabank with or without cause. If Mr. Shearin resigns for good reason or his employment is
terminated without cause (including termination of employment upon the expiration or non-renewal of the term),
however, he is entitled to receive any accrued obligations under the new employment agreement and, subject to
his execution, delivery and non-revocation of a release of claims, a monthly payment equal to one-twelfth his rate
of annual base salary in effect immediately preceding such termination for thirty-six months (the “Shearin
Severance Benefit”), continuing health insurance benefits for himself and his covered spouse and dependents,
with such premiums paid by the company, for thirty-six months (the “Shearin Health Insurance Continuation
Benefit”), out-placement services for up to two years, including job search services, paid for by the company up
to a total of  $10,000 (the “Shearin Out-Placement Benefit”) and an additional amount equal to the average of the
annual bonus compensation earned for the three immediately preceding years (or such fewer number of years for
which he may have been employed), payable in a lump sum on the date of termination, provided that, in all
events, payments may be delayed for six months if required to comply with Section 409A of the Code. These
payments and benefits will cease in the event Mr. Shearin violates any applicable covenants not to compete and
not to solicit customers or employees set forth under the agreement.

Under the new employment agreement with Mr. Shearin, if Mr. Shearin resigns for good reason or his
employment is terminated without cause within one year after a change in control, he is entitled to receive

any accrued obligations under the new employment agreement and, subject to his execution, delivery and non-
revocation of a release of claims, the Shearin Severance Benefit, the Shearin Health Insurance Continuation
Benefit, the Shearin Out-Placement Benefit and an additional amount equal to three times the highest annual
bonus compensation earned for the three immediately preceding years (or such fewer number of years for which
he may have been employed), payable in a lump sum on the date of termination, provided that, in all events,
payments may be delayed for six months if required to comply with Section 409A of the Code. A “change in
control” as defined under the new employment agreement with Mr. Shearin includes the completion of the
merger.

The new employment agreement with Mr. Shearin contains a confidentiality provision that is in effect during
his employment and for at least five years after the termination of his employment and covenants not to compete
and not to solicit customers or employees that are in effect for twelve months after the termination of his
employment, provided that the covenants not to compete and not to solicit customers or employees do not apply
for one year following the effective date of the new employment agreement and do not apply following a change
in control that occurs after the effective date of the new employment agreement.

Under the new employment agreement with Mr. Shearin, if the payments and benefits under the employment
agreement, together with other payments and benefits Mr. Shearin may have the right to receive, on account of a
change in control would exceed the maximum limit imposed on the total of such payments and benefits by
Section 280G of the Code (without triggering the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code), the
agreement provides for a comparison of two alternative scenarios for addressing Section 280G and Section 4999
of the Code, and the application of the scenario that leaves Mr. Shearin in the more favorable net after-tax
position (this comparison process is referred to as a “modified Section 280G cutback”). Specifically, Mr. Shearin
will receive whichever of the following is more favorable to him on a net after-tax basis: (i) the payments and
benefits reduced to the extent necessary so that none of the payments or benefits is subject to the excise tax or (ii)
the full amount of the payments and benefits, which is subject to the excise tax, with Mr. Shearin being
responsible for paying any excise tax imposed. In the event Mr. Shearin receives the full amount of the payments
and benefits and pays the related excise tax (i.e., under scenario (ii) described in the immediately preceding
sentence), SONA or Sonabank will be unable to deduct a portion of the payments and benefits to Mr. Shearin.

Under the new employment agreement with Mr. Shearin, he will generally have “good reason” to terminate
his employment if the company negatively changes certain important aspects of his employment, including
reducing his authority, responsibility or salary, removes him from his position or fails to nominate him for
election to SONA’s board of directors, moves his principal office outside of the Commonwealth of Virginia,
reduces his fringe benefits, fails to comply with any material term of the agreement, fails to require any successor
to expressly assume and agree to perform the obligations under the agreement, or provides written notice of non-
renewal of the initial term or any renewal term of the agreement. Under the new employment agreement with Mr.
Shearin, good reason to terminate employment would not exist unless Mr. Shearin has notified the company of
the condition giving rise to good reason and the company has failed to remedy the condition and Mr. Shearin
terminates employment within ninety days after the initial occurrence of the condition giving rise to good reason.

Under the new employment agreement with Mr. Shearin, termination for “cause” would generally include
Mr. Shearin’s willful misconduct, misappropriation or embezzlement of funds or property, fraud or dishonesty,
failure to perform material duties or responsibilities or failure to follow reasonable instructions or policies,
conviction of, indictment for or entry of a guilty plea or plea of no contest with respect to a felony or
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, breach of a material term of the agreement or material violation of
applicable policies, codes and standards of behavior, willful violation of any final cease-and-desist order, breach
of a fiduciary duty or conduct likely to result in material injury to SONA or Sonabank. Under the new
employment agreement with Mr. Shearin, the company would not have cause to terminate his employment for
failure to perform material duties or responsibilities, failure to follow reasonable instructions or policies, breach
of a material term of the agreement or material violation of applicable policies, codes and standards of behavior
unless the company has notified Mr. Shearin of the existence of such condition and Mr. Shearin has failed to
remedy the condition.

New SONA Employment Agreement with Mr. Sothen.   In connection with the merger, SONA, Sonabank
and Mr. Sothen will enter into a new employment agreement to be effective upon completion of the merger,
pursuant to which Mr. Sothen will serve as chief financial officer of SONA and Sonabank upon completion of the
merger.

The new employment agreement with Mr. Sothen will have an initial term that expires on December 31,
2019, subject to automatic one-year renewals unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal no later
than thirty days before any renewal date. The new employment agreement provides for an annual base salary to
be determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Continuing Corporation and
eligibility for equity awards and annual bonuses and certain other benefits. The new employment agreement also
provides that any incentive compensation paid to Mr. Sothen, including both equity and cash incentive
compensation, is subject to repayment or clawback as further described in the agreement.

Under the new employment agreement with Mr. Sothen, Mr. Sothen’s employment may be terminated by
SONA or Sonabank with or without cause. If Mr. Sothen resigns for good reason or his employment is terminated
without cause, however, he is entitled to receive any accrued obligations under the new employment agreement
and, subject to his execution, delivery and non-revocation of a release of claims, a monthly payment equal to one-
twelfth his rate of annual base salary in effect immediately preceding such termination for twenty-four months,
beginning sixty days after termination of employment, and continuing health insurance benefits for himself and
his covered spouse and dependents, with the employer portion of such premiums paid by the company for
twenty-four months (the “Sothen Health Insurance Continuation Benefit”), provided that, in all events, payments
may be delayed for six months if required to comply with Section 409A of the Code. These payments and
benefits will cease in the event Mr. Sothen violates the confidentiality provision or any applicable covenants not
to compete and not to solicit customers or employees set forth under the agreement.

Under the new employment agreement with Mr. Sothen, if Mr. Sothen resigns for good reason or his
employment is terminated without cause after the end of the term of the employment agreement and Mr. Sothen
is subject to the covenant not to compete, Mr. Sothen is entitled to receive any accrued obligations under the new
employment agreement and, subject to his execution, delivery and non-revocation of a release of claims, a
monthly payment equal to one-twelfth his rate of annual base salary in effect immediately preceding such
termination for twelve months, beginning sixty days after termination of employment, provided that payments
may be delayed for six months if required to comply with Section 409A of the Code. These payments will cease
in the event Mr. Sothen violates the confidentiality provision or any applicable covenants not to compete and not
to solicit customers or employees set forth under the agreement.

Under the new employment agreement with Mr. Sothen, if Mr. Sothen resigns for good reason or his
employment is terminated without cause within one year after a change in control, he is entitled to receive any
accrued obligations under the new employment agreement and, subject to his execution, delivery and non-
revocation of a release of claims, an amount equal to one-twelfth his rate of annual base salary in effect
immediately preceding such termination for twenty-four months, payable in a lump sum on the sixtieth day after
termination of employment, the Sothen Health Insurance Continuation Benefit and an additional amount equal to
two times the highest annual bonus compensation earned for the three immediately preceding years (or such
fewer number of years for which he may have been employed), payable in a lump sum on the sixtieth day after
termination of employment, provided that, in all events, payments may be delayed for six months if required to
comply with Section 409A of the Code. These payments and benefits will cease in the event Mr. Sothen violates
the confidentiality provision or any applicable covenants not to solicit customers or employees set forth under the

include the completion of the merger.

The new employment agreement with Mr. Sothen contains a confidentiality provision that is in effect during
his employment and for at least five years after the termination of his employment and covenants not to compete

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Under the new employment agreement with Mr. Sothen, if the payments and benefits under the employment
agreement, together with other payments and benefits Mr. Sothen may have the right to receive, on account of a
change in control would exceed the maximum limit imposed on the total of such payments and benefits by
Section 280G of the Code (without triggering the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code), the
agreement provides for a comparison of two alternative scenarios for addressing Section 280G and Section 4999
of the Code, and the application of the scenario that leaves Mr. Sothen in the more favorable net after-tax position
(i.e., a modified Section 280G cutback). Specifically, Mr. Sothen will receive whichever of the following is more
favorable to him on a net after-tax basis: (i) the payments and benefits reduced to the extent necessary so that
none of the payments or benefits is subject to the excise tax or (ii) the full amount of the payments and benefits,
which is subject to the excise tax, with Mr. Sothen being responsible for paying any excise tax imposed. In the
event Mr. Sothen receives the full amount of the payments and benefits and pays the related excise tax (i.e., under
scenario (ii) described in the immediately preceding sentence), SONA or Sonabank will be unable to deduct a
portion of the payments and benefits to Mr. Sothen.

Under the new employment agreement with Mr. Sothen, he will generally have “good reason” to terminate
his employment if the company negatively changes certain important aspects of his employment, including
materially reducing his authority, responsibility or salary, moves his principal office outside of Richmond,
Virginia and any contiguous counties, or fails to comply with any material term of the agreement. Under the new
employment agreement with Mr. Sothen, good reason to terminate employment would not exist unless Mr.
Sothen has notified the company of the condition giving rise to good reason and the company has failed to
remedy the condition and Mr. Sothen terminates employment within ninety days after the initial occurrence of the
condition giving rise to good reason.

With respect to the provisions of the new employment agreement with Mr. Sothen related to the termination
of Mr. Sothen’s employment without “cause,” the terms of Mr. Sothen’s agreement are identical to those of the
new employment agreement with Mr. Shearin detailed above.

Employee Benefit Plans.   On or as soon as reasonably practicable following completion of the merger,
employees of EVBS and EVB, including any executive officers, who continue on as employees of SONA or
Sonabank will be entitled to participate in other benefit plans of SONA or Sonabank on terms substantially
comparable to EVBS or EVB plans in effect immediately prior to the merger. With certain exceptions, these
employees will receive credit for their years of service with EVBS or EVB for participation, vesting and benefit
accrual purposes.

Golden Parachute Compensation.   The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t)
of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC regarding certain compensation which EVBS named executive
officers may receive that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger. The amounts are calculated assuming
that the effective date of the merger and a qualifying termination occurred on April 1, 2017 and that all required
conditions to the payment of these amounts have been satisfied. The merger-related compensation payable to the
EVBS named executive officers is the subject of a non-binding advisory vote of EVBS shareholders, as described
under “Proposals to be Considered at the EVBS Special Meeting — Approval of the EVBS Compensation
Proposal (EVBS Proposal No. 2)” beginning on page 45.

(1) Amounts listed in this column represent single-trigger accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards that are
subject to time-based or performance-based vesting restrictions at the time the merger closes, assuming a
value of  $10.12 per each unvested share of common stock (which is the average closing market price of
EVBS common stock over the first five business days following the first public announcement of the
merger).

(2) Amounts listed in this column represent the incremental amount of the benefit under the EVBS SERP for
which vesting would be accelerated in connection with the merger. The accelerated vesting is a single-
trigger enhancement that fully vests each executive in his normal retirement benefit under the EVBS SERP;
time of payment, however, is not accelerated in connection with the merger. At April 1, 2017, Mr. Shearin’s
cumulative vested percentage in his normal retirement benefit was 50.4% and Mr. Hanna’s cumulative
vested percentage in his normal retirement benefit was 15.07%, in each case based on the executive’s prior
years of service. A present value discount with an assumed interest rate of 3.36% has been applied to the
amounts listed in this column.

(3) Mr. Shearin and Mr. Thomas participate in the EVBS Cash Balance Plan. In connection with the merger,
EVBS will fully fund the EVBS Cash Balance Plan, fully vest all participants in the benefits provided to
them under the plan, terminate the plan and distribute benefits to participants. No related dollar value is
included in this table because each of Mr. Shearin and Mr. Thomas is currently fully vested in the benefits
provided to him under the plan and such account balance will not be increased or enhanced in connection
with the merger.

(4) EVBS named executive officers will not receive tax reimbursements in connection with the merger.

(5) Amounts listed in this column are subject to reduction for Mr. Thomas in connection with Section 280G of
the Code. Amounts listed in this column may be subject to reduction for Mr. Shearin depending on the
application of the modified Section 280G cutback following completion of the merger.

(6) In connection with the merger, SONA, Sonabank and Mr. Shearin will enter into a new employment
agreement to be effective upon completion of the merger. Upon its effective date, the new employment
agreement with Mr. Shearin will supersede the current EVBS employment agreement with Mr. Shearin.
Accordingly, Mr. Shearin will have no rights or entitlements and will receive no payment or benefit under
his current EVBS employment agreement. The only change in control payments or benefits Mr. Shearin is
expected to receive in connection with the merger are the single-trigger accelerated vesting of restricted
stock awards that are subject to time-based or performance-based vesting restrictions at the time the merger
closes and single-trigger accelerated vesting (but not accelerated payment) under the EVBS SERP.

(7) In connection with the merger, SONA, Sonabank and Mr. Sothen will enter into a new employment
agreement to be effective upon completion of the merger. Upon its effective date, the new employment
agreement with Mr. Sothen will supersede the EVBS executive severance plan with respect to Mr. Sothen.
Accordingly, Mr. Sothen will have no rights or entitlements and will receive no payment or benefit under the
EVBS executive severance plan. The only change in control payment or benefit Mr. Sothen is expected to
receive in connection with the merger is the single-trigger accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards that
are subject to time-based or performance-based vesting restrictions at the time the merger closes.

(8) This amount represents estimated cash payments under the employment agreement with Mr. Hanna upon a
termination without cause or for good reason within one year after a change in control (double-trigger) and
is equal to two times his base salary on the date of termination. This amount is payable in a lump sum upon
termination, provided that the payment may be delayed for six months if required to comply with Section
409A of the Code. This amount does not include interest that would be payable under the employment
agreement with Mr. Hanna in the event of a six-month delay.

(9) This amount represents estimated cash payments under the EVBS executive severance plan upon a
termination without cause or a constructive discharge within one year after a change in control (double-
trigger) and is equal to twelve months of base salary continuation at the rate in effect on the date of
termination. This amount is payable for twelve months following termination in accordance with established
payroll practices. Payment of this amount is subject to the executive’s execution, delivery and non-
revocation of a release of claims.

(10) This amount represents estimated cash payments under the EVBS executive severance plan upon a
termination without cause or a constructive discharge within one year after a change in control (double-
trigger) and is equal to twelve months of the regular employer-paid portion of the monthly premium for the
executive’s then-currently elected medical insurance for himself and, if applicable, his covered spouse and
dependents, provided the executive elects and receives coverage under COBRA during the twelve-month
period. This amount is payable for twelve months following termination in accordance with established
payroll practices. Payment of this amount is subject to the executive’s execution, delivery and non-
revocation of a release of claims.

(11) This amount represents estimated cash payments under the employment agreement with Mr. Thomas upon a
termination without cause or for good reason within one year after a change in control (double-trigger) and
is equal to 2.99 times the executive’s five-year average base compensation as defined in Section 280G of the
Code. Of this amount, $130,406 is payable for nine months following terminaton in accordance with
established payroll practices and $342,720 is payable in a lump sum upon termination, provided that the
payment may be delayed for six months if required to comply with Section 409A of the Code. This amount
does not include interest that would be payable under the employment agreement with Mr. Thomas in the
event of a six-month delay. Payment of this amount is subject to reduction as needed so that no cash or other
compensation would constitute an “excess parachute payment” causing the executive to be subject to an
excise tax under Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code. The amount in this table does not reflect any
such reduction.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Regulatory Approvals

SONA and EVBS cannot complete the merger without prior approval from the Federal Reserve and the
Virginia SCC, and cannot complete the subsidiary bank merger without prior approval from the Federal Reserve
and the Virginia SCC. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, we have received approval from
both the Federal Reserve and from the Virginia SCC.

Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights in the Merger

Under Virginia law, the common shareholders of SONA and EVBS are not entitled to dissenters’ or
appraisal rights in connection with the merger. Castle Creek and GCP, in their capacities as holders of EVBS
preferred stock, have consented to the merger and are thereby precluded from asserting any appraisal or
dissenters’ rights under Virginia law in connection with the merger.

Certain Differences in Rights of Shareholders

SONA and EVBS are Virginia corporations governed by the Virginia SCA. In addition, the rights of SONA
and EVBS shareholders are governed by their respective articles of incorporation and bylaws. Upon completion
of the merger, EVBS shareholders will become shareholders of SONA, and as such their shareholder rights will
then be governed by SONA’s articles of incorporation and bylaws of SONA and by the Virginia SCA. The rights
of shareholders of SONA differ in certain respects from the rights of shareholders of EVBS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A summary of the material differences between the rights of an EVBS shareholder under the Virginia SCA
and EVBS’s articles of incorporation and bylaws, on the one hand, and the rights of a SONA shareholder under
the Virginia SCA and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of SONA, on the other hand, is provided in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus in the section “Comparative Rights of Shareholders” on page 111.

Accounting Treatment

The merger will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to generally accepted
accounting principles in the U.S., or “GAAP.” Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and
liabilities, including identifiable intangible assets arising from the transaction, of EVBS will be recorded, as of
completion of the merger, at their respective fair values and added to those of SONA. Any excess of purchase
price over the fair values is recorded as goodwill. Financial statements and reported results of operations of
SONA issued after completion of the merger will reflect these values, but will not be restated retroactively to
reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of EVBS. See also “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Information” beginning on page 20.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary description of the material provisions of the merger agreement, as amended.
The following description of the merger agreement is subject to and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated
herein by reference. We urge you to read the merger agreement in its entirety as it is the legal document
governing the merger.

Terms of the Merger

The SONA board of directors and the EVBS board of directors have each unanimously approved the merger
agreement, which provides for the merger of EVBS with and into SONA. Pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, as a result of the merger, each share of EVBS common stock issued and outstanding before the
merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.6313 shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation,
which we have defined as the “exchange ratio” for the purposes of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. If the
outstanding shares of SONA common stock or EVBS common stock are increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of securities as a result of a reorganization, stock dividend, stock split,
reverse stock split or similar change in capitalization, then a proportionate adjustment will be made to the
exchange ratio.

In addition, the holders of shares of EVBS preferred stock will have the right to receive 0.6313 shares of
common stock of the Continuing Corporation for each share of EVBS preferred stock held immediately prior to
the effective date of the merger. Upon the effective date of the merger, SONA common stock, including shares
issued to former holders of EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred stock, will be the common stock of the
Continuing Corporation.

The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of the
merger.

After the merger, EVB, the bank subsidiary of EVBS, will merge with and into Sonabank, the bank
subsidiary of SONA. Sonabank will be the surviving bank in the bank merger. SONA and EVBS expect to
complete the merger and the bank merger during the second quarter of 2017.

Effective Date; Closing

The effective date of the merger will be the effective date and time set forth in the articles of merger that
SONA and EVBS will file with the Virginia SCC. We anticipate that we will complete the merger during the
second quarter of 2017, subject to the receipt of required shareholder approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of
the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement. See “— Conditions to Completion of the Merger” at
page 93.

There can be no assurances as to if or when the shareholder approvals will be obtained or continued or that
the merger will be completed. If we do not complete the merger by November 30, 2017, either party may
terminate the merger agreement, provided that such termination right is not available to a party whose action or
inaction has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before such date and such
action or inaction constitutes a breach of the merger agreement.

Merger Consideration

General.   In the proposed merger, holders of EVBS common stock will have the right to receive 0.6313
shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation for each share of EVBS common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the effective date of the merger. In the proposed merger, holders of EVBS preferred stock
will have the right to receive 0.6313 shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation for each share of
EVBS preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger. This exchange ratio is
fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to the closing of the merger.

Based on the average closing price of SONA’s common stock for the ten trading days ended December 12,
2016 ($15.39), the 0.6313 exchange ratio represented approximately $9.72 in value for each share of EVBS
common and EVBS preferred stock, or approximately $178.3 million in the aggregate.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Based on the average closing price of SONA’s common stock for the ten trading days ended May 10, 2017, the
last trading day before the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the 0.6313 exchange ratio represented
approximately $11.29 in value for each share of EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred stock, or
approximately $208.4 million in the aggregate.

Each share of SONA common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger will continue to be
outstanding after the merger and SONA’s shareholders will continue to own their existing shares of SONA
common stock. Upon the effective date of the merger, SONA common stock, including shares issued to former
holders of EVBS common and EVBS preferred stock, will be the common stock of the Continuing Corporation.

Fractional Shares.   SONA will not issue any fractional shares of common stock. Instead, an EVBS
shareholder who would otherwise have received a fraction of a share will receive an amount of cash equal to the
fraction of a share of common stock of the Continuing Corporation to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled multiplied by the closing sale price of SONA common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on the
trading day immediately preceding (but not including) the effective date of the merger.

Treatment of EVBS Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards

Each option granted under an EVBS equity-based compensation plan that is outstanding immediately prior
to the effective date of the merger will vest and be converted into and become an option to purchase shares of
common stock of the Continuing Corporation (each, an “Assumed Option”), which will be adjusted (i) by
multiplying the number of shares of common stock that may be purchased under the Assumed Option by the
exchange ratio and rounding down to the nearest share, and (ii) by dividing the per share exercise price of the
Assumed Option by the exchange ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent. The Continuing Corporation will
assume each Assumed Option, in accordance with the terms of the EVBS stock plan and award agreement by
which it is evidenced.

Each share of EVBS common stock subject to time-based or performance-based vesting restrictions granted
under an EVBS stock plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger will, pursuant
to the terms of each such grant, vest in full immediately prior to the effective date of the merger and be
automatically converted into the right to receive unrestricted shares of common stock of the Continuing
Corporation based on the exchange ratio, less the amount of any required withholding tax. In addition, the
Continuing Corporation will assume the EVBS stock plans at the effective date of the merger, only with respect
to the Assumed Options.

Exchange of Stock in the Merger
SONA Common Stock.   Upon the effective date of the merger, each share of SONA common stock issued

and outstanding, including shares issued to former holders of EVBS common and EVBS preferred stock, will be
the common stock of the Continuing Corporation and will continue to be issued and outstanding after the
completion of the merger. As a result, there is no need for SONA shareholder to take any action as a result of the
completion of the merger, including submitting any certificates representing shares of SONA common stock to
SONA, the exchange agent or any other person in connection with the merger.

EVBS Common and Preferred Stock.   At or promptly after the effective date of the merger, SONA will
deposit with the exchange agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation that would otherwise be issued in the merger, and will
authorize and direct issuance by the exchange agent of non-certificated shares of common stock of the
Continuing Corporation represented by book-entry registry, in each case for the benefit of the holders of EVBS
common and EVBS preferred stock.

Within five business days after the completion of the merger, the exchange agent will send transmittal
materials to each holder of EVBS common or EVBS preferred stock for use in exchanging such EVBS common
or EVBS preferred stock for shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation and cash instead of
fractional shares, if applicable. Such transmittal materials shall permit each holder of EVBS common or EVBS
preferred stock to elect to receive, in lieu of shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation represented
by book-entry registry, a physical stock certificate representing shares of common stock of the Continuing
Corporation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EVBS stock certificates should NOT be returned with the enclosed proxy card, and should NOT be
forwarded to the exchange agent until you receive a transmittal letter following completion of the merger. Until
you exchange your shares of EVBS common or EVBS preferred stock for shares of common stock of the
Continuing Corporation, you will not receive any dividends or distributions in respect of shares of EVBS
common stock. Once you exchange your shares of EVBS common stock for shares of common stock of the
Continuing Corporation, you will receive, without interest, the merger consideration and all undelivered
dividends or distributions with a record date after the effective date of the merger.

If you own EVBS common stock through a broker, bank or other holder of record, you will not need to
obtain a certificate to represent shares of EVBS common stock to deliver it to the exchange agent to exchange for
the merger consideration.

If your EVBS common or EVBS preferred stock certificate has been lost, destroyed or stolen or is otherwise
missing, SONA and the exchange agent may require you to make an affidavit of that fact and to post a bond in a
reasonable amount as an indemnity against any claim that may be made against SONA with respect to the lost,
destroyed, stolen or otherwise missing EVBS common or EVBS preferred stock certificate.

must be true and correct in all material respects, and representations relating to capitalization and absence of
certain events or changes reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect, which must be true and correct in all
respects, no representation will be deemed untrue or incorrect as a consequence of the existence or absence of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

No Solicitation

SONA and EVBS have agreed that, while the merger agreement is in effect, each party will not, and will
cause its subsidiaries and its and its subsidiaries’ officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives not to,
directly or indirectly:

For purposes of the merger agreement, an “acquisition proposal” means, other than transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of
interest in, any of the following transactions involving SONA or EVBS or their subsidiaries:

Under the merger agreement, however, if SONA or EVBS receives an unsolicited bona fide written
acquisition proposal, such party may furnish nonpublic information to or enter into discussion or negotiations
with the person or entity making the acquisition proposal only if:

SONA and EVBS have each agreed to immediately notify the other orally and in writing within 24 hours
following receipt of any acquisition proposal, including a description of the material terms and conditions of the
proposal (including the identity of the proposing party), and to keep the other apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all material
documentation or correspondence relating thereto.

• is more favorable to the shareholders of SONA or EVBS, as the case may be, from a financial point of
view, than the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended
by SONA or EVBS, as applicable); and

• is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed and reasonably likely to receive all
required approvals of governmental authorities on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of
being completed on the terms proposed.

• the merger has not been completed by November 30, 2017, unless the failure to complete the merger by
such time was caused by a failure to perform an obligation under the merger agreement by the
terminating party and such failure to perform constitutes a breach of the merger agreement;

• any required regulatory approval has been denied by the relevant governmental authority and such
denial has become final and nonappealable or any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has
issued a final and nonappealable injunction permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement;

• there is a breach or inaccuracy by the other party of any representation or warranty contained in the
merger agreement that would cause the failure of the closing conditions described above, and the
breach is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the breaching party or by its nature
cannot be cured within such time period;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For purposes of the merger agreement, a “superior proposal” means an unsolicited, bona fide written
acquisition proposal made by a person or entity that the board of directors of SONA or EVBS, as the case may
be, concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the acquisition proposal and including the terms and conditions of
the merger agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by SONA or EVBS, as applicable):

For the purposes of the definition of  “superior proposal,” the term “acquisition proposal” has the same
meaning as described above, except the reference to “20% or more” is changed to be a reference to “50%” and an
“acquisition proposal” can only refer to a transaction involving EVBS or SONA or one of their respective
banking subsidiaries.

Furthermore, neither SONA’s nor EVBS’s board of directors or any committee of such boards will withhold,
withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the other party (or propose publicly to do so) its recommendations
of approval of the SONA merger proposal and the EVBS merger proposal, respectively, unless (i) an unsolicited
bona fide written acquisition proposal is made by a third party and not withdrawn, (ii) the board of directors of
the applicable party concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that the acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal, (iii) the board of directors of the applicable
party concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable law, (iv) five
days elapse since the required notice is given to the other party (three days for any notice regarding the
amendment to any material term of the acquisition proposal), (v) the notifying party considers any adjustments or
modifications to the merger agreement offered by the other party and engages in good faith discussions if
requested, and (vi) the board of directors of the applicable party again reasonably determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors and taking into account any proposed adjustments
or modifications to the merger agreement) that the acquisition proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal
and that failure to change the recommendation is reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to
its shareholders under applicable law.

SONA and EVBS, at any time before the merger is completed, by mutual consent in writing of the parties.

proposal, any action, proposal, transaction or agreement which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere
with, delay, discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the timely consummation of the merger or the fulfillment of
SONA’s or EVBS’s conditions under the merger agreement. The affiliate agreements terminate upon the earlier to
occur of the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms.

Voting Agreement and Election of Consideration by EVBS Preferred Shareholders

Castle Creek and GCP have entered into voting agreements and elections of consideration (the “Voting
Agreements”) with SONA and EVBS pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed to vote all shares of
EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred stock beneficially owned by them in favor of the EVBS merger
proposal and against any competing acquisition proposal or any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that
could be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the timely
consummation of the merger or the fulfillment of EVBS’s or SONA’s conditions under the merger agreement.

Also pursuant to the Voting Agreements, the shareholders have agreed to elect to receive shares of common
stock of the Continuing Corporation for the shares of EVBS preferred stock held by the shareholders. As of
April 24, 2017, the record date for the EVBS special meeting, Castle Creek and GCP are collectively entitled to
vote 2,183,981 shares of EVBS common and 5,240,192 shares of EVBS preferred stock, or approximately 16.6%
and 100.0% of the total voting power of the shares of EVBS common and EVBS preferred stock outstanding on
that date, respectively, and all such shares of EVBS common and EVBS preferred stock are subject to the Voting
Agreements.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

Subject to the limitations, assumptions and qualifications described herein, it is the opinion of each of Alston
& Bird LLP and Troutman Sanders LLP that the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to
“U.S. holders” (as defined below) of EVBS common and EVBS preferred stock that exchange their shares of
EVBS common or EVBS preferred stock for shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation in the
merger are as described below. The following discussion is based upon the Code, regulations of the U.S.
Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”), judicial authorities, published positions of the IRS and other applicable
authorities, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations (possibly
with retroactive effect). The tax opinions of outside legal counsel for each of SONA and EVBS are filed as
Exhibit 8.1 and Exhibit 8.2, respectively, to the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus is a part. These opinions, however, will not bind the IRS or the courts. No assurance can be
given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax
consequences set forth below.

This discussion does not address the tax consequences of the merger under state, local or foreign tax laws, or
federal laws other than those pertaining to income tax, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the
unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of
2010.

This discussion is limited to U.S. holders (as defined below) that hold their shares of EVBS common or
EVBS preferred stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held
for investment). Furthermore, this discussion does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to
a particular EVBS shareholder or to EVBS shareholders that are subject to special rules under U.S. federal
income tax laws, such as: shareholders that are not U.S. holders; banks, thrifts or other financial institutions;
qualified insurance plans; insurance companies; mutual funds; qualified retirement plans and individual
retirement accounts; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations or other pass-through entities (or investors in such
entities); regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; dealers in securities or currencies;
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code; former citizens or residents of the United
States; persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; persons who purchase or sell their shares of
EVBS common or EVBS preferred stock as part of a wash sale; traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-
market method of accounting; persons who own more than 5% of the outstanding EVBS common stock and
EVBS preferred stock; persons who hold EVBS common stock or EVBS preferred stock as part of a straddle,
hedge, constructive sale or conversion transaction; and U.S. holders who acquired their shares of EVBS common
stock or EVBS preferred stock through the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation.

For purposes of this section, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of EVBS common stock or
EVBS preferred stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is: a citizen or resident of the United States; a
corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in
or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; an estate that is subject to
U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source; or a trust, the substantial decisions of which are
controlled by one or more U.S. persons and which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court, or a trust
that validly has elected under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

If a partnership or other entity taxed as a partnership holds EVBS common stock or EVBS preferred stock,
the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners in such a partnership should consult their tax advisers
about the tax consequences of the merger to them.

Holders of EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred stock are urged to consult with their own tax
advisors as to the tax consequences of the merger in their particular circumstances, including the
applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local or foreign and other tax laws
and of any changes in those laws.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Merger

Subject to the limitations, assumptions and qualifications described herein, the merger will be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Accordingly, and as described in greater detail
below, no gain or loss will be recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes in respect of the receipt of shares
of the Continuing Corporation, except for any gain or loss that may result from the receipt of cash instead of
fractional shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation. Consummation of the merger is conditioned
upon each of SONA and EVBS receiving a written tax opinion, dated the closing date of the merger, from its
outside legal counsel to the effect that, based upon facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to
in such opinions, the merger will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
The issuance of the opinions is conditioned on, among other things, such counsel’s receipt of representation
letters from each of SONA and EVBS, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such
counsel, and on customary factual assumptions. SONA and EVBS each has the ability to waive the condition to
obtain a tax opinion. Neither SONA nor EVBS currently intends to waive this opinion condition to its obligation
to consummate the merger. If either SONA or EVBS waives this opinion condition after the registration statement
of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part is declared effective by the SEC, and if the tax
consequences of the merger to EVBS shareholders have materially changed, SONA and EVBS will recirculate
appropriate soliciting materials to resolicit the votes of the SONA and EVBS shareholders. Neither of these
opinions of counsel is binding on the IRS or the courts and no ruling has been, or will be, sought from the IRS as
to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the IRS
will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to the consequences set forth below. In
addition, if any of the representations or assumptions upon which the opinions are based are inconsistent with the
actual facts, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger could be adversely affected. Accordingly,
each EVBS shareholder should consult its tax advisor with respect to the particular tax consequences of the
merger to such holder.

Consequences to SONA and EVBS

Each of SONA and EVBS will be a party to the merger within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code,
and neither SONA nor EVBS will recognize any gain or loss as a result of the merger.

Consequences to Shareholders

Exchange of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Preferred Stock for Common Stock of the Continuing
Corporation.   U.S. holders of EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred stock that exchange all of their EVBS
common stock and EVBS preferred stock for common stock of the Continuing Corporation will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except, as discussed below, with respect to cash
received in lieu of fractional shares of common stock of the Continuing Corporation.

Cash Received in Lieu of Fractional Shares.   A U.S. holder of EVBS common stock or EVBS preferred
stock that receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of common stock of the Continuing Corporation in the merger
generally will be treated as if the fractional share of common stock of the Continuing Corporation had been
distributed to such U.S. holder as part of the merger, and then redeemed by SONA in exchange for the cash
actually distributed in lieu of the fractional share, with the redemption generally qualifying as an “exchange”
under Section 302(a) of the Code. Consequently, those holders generally will recognize capital gain or loss with
respect to the cash payments they receive in lieu of fractional shares, measured by the difference between the
amount of cash received and the tax basis allocated to the fractional shares, and such gain or loss will be long-
term capital gain or loss if, as of the effective date of the merger, the holding period of such shares is greater than
one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Tax Basis in, and Holding Period for, Common Stock of the Continuing Corporation Received in the
Merger.   A U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in the common stock of the Continuing Corporation received in the
merger will be equal to such shareholder’s aggregate tax basis in the EVBS common stock or EVBS preferred
stock surrendered in the merger, reduced by any basis allocable to a fractional share of common stock of the
Continuing Corporation for which cash is received. The holding period of common stock of the Continuing
Corporation received by a U.S. holder in the merger will include the holding period of the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EVBS common stock or EVBS preferred stock exchanged in the merger if the EVBS common stock or EVBS
preferred stock exchanged is held as a capital asset at the time of the merger. If a U.S. holder acquired different
blocks of EVBS common stock or EVBS preferred stock at different times or at different prices, the common
stock of the Continuing Corporation such holder receives will be allocated pro rata to each block of EVBS
common stock and EVBS preferred stock, and the basis and holding period of each block of common stock and
non-voting common stock of the Continuing Corporation such holder receives will be determined on a block-for-
block basis depending on the basis and holding period of the blocks of EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred
stock exchanged for such block of common stock of the Continuing Corporation.

Backup Withholding and Reporting Requirements

U.S. holders of EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred stock, other than certain exempt recipients, may
be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 28% with respect to any cash payment received in the merger in lieu
of fractional shares. However, backup withholding will not apply to any U.S. holder that either (a) furnishes a
correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding or (b) otherwise
proves to SONA and its exchange agent that the U.S. holder is exempt from backup withholding. Any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or credit against the holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.

In addition, U.S. holders of EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred stock are required to retain
permanent records and make such records available to any authorized IRS officers and employees. The records
should include the number of shares of EVBS stock exchanged, the number of shares of Continuing Corporation
stock received, the fair market value and tax basis of EVBS common stock and preferred stock exchanged and
the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the common stock of the Continuing Corporation received.

If a U.S. holder of EVBS common stock or EVBS preferred stock that exchanges such stock for common
stock of the Continuing Corporation is a “significant holder” with respect to EVBS, the U.S. holder is required to
include a statement with respect to the exchange on or with the U.S. federal income tax return of the U.S. holder
for the year of the exchange. A U.S. holder of EVBS common stock or EVBS preferred stock will be treated as a
significant holder in EVBS if the U.S. holder’s ownership interest in EVBS is five percent (5%) or more, by vote
or value, of EVBS’s issued and outstanding common stock and preferred stock or if the U.S. holder’s basis in the
shares of EVBS stock exchanged is one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more. The statement must be prepared in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3 and must be entitled “STATEMENT PURSUANT TO
§1.368-3 BY [INSERT NAME AND TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF TAXPAYER], A
SIGNIFICANT HOLDER”. The statement must include the information set forth in such regulation, including
the names and employer identification numbers of EVBS and SONA, the date of the merger, and the fair market
value and tax basis of EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred stock exchanged (determined immediately
before the merger).

The foregoing tax discussion is only a summary. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed
as, tax advice. Holders of EVBS common stock and EVBS preferred stock are urged to consult their
independent tax advisors with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular
situations as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, or under
the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

You are advised to obtain current market quotations for SONA common stock and EVBS common stock.
The market price of SONA common stock at the effective date of the merger or at the time former shareholders of
EVBS receive evidence of book entry issuance of shares, or if requested certificates evidencing shares, of SONA
common stock after the merger is completed may be higher or lower than the market price at the time the merger
agreement was executed, at the date of mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the
special meetings.

SONA and EVBS are legal entities separate and distinct from their subsidiaries, and their revenues depend
primarily on the payment of dividends from their subsidiary banks. Therefore, SONA’s and EVBS’s principal
sources of funds with which to pay dividends on their stock and their other separate expenses are dividends they
receive, respectively, from Sonabank and EVB. The subsidiary banks of both SONA and EVBS are subject to
certain regulatory and other legal restrictions on the amount of dividends they are permitted to pay to SONA and
EVBS. See “Description of SONA Capital Stock — Common Stock — Dividends” on page 109.

SONA currently pays dividends on its common stock on a quarterly basis, and it anticipates declaring and
paying quarterly dividends after completion of the merger. SONA has no current intention to change its dividend
strategy, but has and will continue to evaluate that decision on a quarterly basis. After the merger, the final
determination of the timing, amount and payment of dividends on SONA common stock will be at the discretion
of its board of directors and will depend upon the earnings of SONA and its subsidiaries, the financial condition
of SONA and other factors, including general economic conditions and applicable governmental regulations and
policies.

corporation generally may not authorize and make distributions if, after giving effect to the distribution, it would
be unable to meet its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or if the corporation’s total assets
would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if it were dissolved at that
time, to satisfy the preferential rights of shareholders whose rights are superior to the rights of those receiving the
distribution. In addition, the payment of distributions to shareholders is subject to any prior rights of outstanding
preferred stock.

As a bank holding company, SONA’s ability to pay dividends is affected by the ability of Sonabank, its bank
subsidiary, to pay dividends to the holding company. The ability of Sonabank, as well as SONA, to pay dividends
in the future is, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory requirements and capital guidelines.

Liquidation Rights.   In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of SONA, the holders of
shares of its common stock will be entitled to receive, after payment of all debts and liabilities of SONA and after
satisfaction of all liquidation preferences applicable to any preferred stock, all remaining assets of SONA
available for distribution in cash or in kind.

Voting Rights.   The holders of SONA common stock are entitled to one vote per share and, in general, a
majority of votes cast with respect to a matter is sufficient to authorize action upon routine matters. Holders of
SONA common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes
cast, and shareholders do not have the right to cumulate their votes in the election of directors.

Directors and Classes of Directors.   SONA’s board of directors is divided into three classes with directors
serving staggered three-year terms. Any newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships are
apportioned among the classes as evenly as possible. Currently, the SONA board of

directors consists of eight directors. Under SONA’s articles of incorporation, directors may be removed for cause
upon the affirmative vote of not less than 75% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in an election
of directors. Cause for removal exists only if a director whose removal is proposed has been either declared
incompetent by an order of a court, convicted of a felony or of an offense punishable by imprisonment for a term
of more than one year, or deemed liable by a court for gross negligence or misconduct in the performance of such
director’s duties to SONA.

No Preemptive Rights; Redemption and Assessment.   Holders of shares of SONA will not be entitled to
preemptive rights with respect to any shares that may be issued. SONA common stock is not subject to
redemption or any sinking fund and the outstanding shares are fully paid and nonassessable.

Preferred Stock

The board of directors of SONA is empowered to authorize the issuance, in one or more series, of shares of
preferred stock at such times, for such purposes and for such consideration as it may deem advisable without
shareholder approval. The SONA board of directors is also authorized to fix the designations, voting, conversion,
preference and other relative rights, qualifications and limitations of any such series of preferred stock. The
SONA board of directors, without shareholder approval, may authorize the issuance of one or more series of
preferred stock with voting and conversion rights which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of
SONA common stock and, under certain circumstances, discourage an attempt by others to gain control of
SONA.

The creation and issuance of any series of preferred stock, and the relative rights, designations and
preferences of such series, if and when established, will depend upon, among other things, the future capital
needs of SONA, then existing market conditions and other factors that, in the judgment of the SONA board,
might warrant the issuance of preferred stock.

COMPARATIVE RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

SONA and EVBS are Virginia corporations subject to the provisions of the Virginia SCA. The rights of
shareholders of SONA and EVBS are governed by their respective articles of incorporation and bylaws. Upon
completion of the proposed merger, EVBS shareholders will become shareholders of SONA and, as such, their
shareholder rights will be governed by SONA’s articles of incorporation and bylaws and will continue to be
governed by the Virginia SCA.

The table below summarizes the material differences between the rights of SONA’s shareholders and those
of EVBS’s shareholders pursuant to the Virginia SCA and their respective constitutive documents as they are
currently in effect. While SONA and EVBS believe that the summary table includes the material differences
between the rights of their respective shareholders prior to the merger, this summary does not include a complete
description of all the differences between the rights of SONA’s shareholders and those of EVBS’s shareholders,
nor does it include a complete description of the specific rights of the respective shareholders discussed. The
inclusion of differences in the rights of these shareholders in the table is not intended to indicate that all of such
differences should necessarily be considered material by you or that other differences that you may consider
equally important do not exist. Shareholders should read carefully the relevant provisions of the Virginia SCA
and the respective articles of incorporation and bylaws of SONA and EVBS. This summary is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of SONA and EVBS, as currently in effect, and
to the provisions of the Virginia SCA.

incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue
the preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the

or state securities law.

SONA EVBS
SONA’s articles of incorporation provide that the
personal liability of directors and officers for monetary

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If EVBS holds a special meeting of shareholders at
which directors are to be elected, the EVBS bylaws
provide that a shareholder may nominate a person for
election to the board of directors of EVBS by
delivering written notice to EVBS that satisfies
requirements set forth in the EVBS bylaws that are
substantially similar to the requirements described
above.

The EVBS bylaws also provide that a shareholder may
propose business to be considered by shareholders at
an annual meeting of shareholders, subject to the same
notice requirements as apply to shareholder
nomination of directors for election at an annual
meeting; provided that the proposing shareholder must
also include in the shareholder’s notice a brief
description of the business to be brought before the
meeting (including the text of the proposal or
resolution to be approved), the reasons for conducting
such business, and any material interest in such
business of the proposing shareholder.

Payment of Dividends
SONA EVBS

SONA’s bylaws permit SONA’s board of directors to
declare dividends upon its capital stock at any regular
or special meeting, to be paid in cash, in property or in
shares of capital stock. Before payment of any
dividend, there will be set aside out of any funds of
SONA available for dividends such sum or sums as the
board of directors, in its absolute discretion, may deem
proper as a reserve to meet contingencies, or for
dividends, or for repairing or maintain property or for
any other proper purpose.

The Virginia SCA permits the payment of dividends so
long as, after giving effect to such dividend, (i) the
corporation is able to pay its debts as they become due
in the usual course or business and (ii) the
corporation’s total assets is not less than the sum of its
total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if
the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the
dividend to satisfy the preferential rights upon
dissolution to shareholders whose preferential rights
are superior to those receiving the dividend.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Appraisal Rights
The Virginia SCA provides that shareholders of a Virginia corporation are generally entitled to object and receive
payment of the fair value of the shares they hold in the event of any of the following corporate actions: (i) a
merger if shareholder approval is required and the shareholders are entitled to vote on the merger; (ii) a share
exchange, if the shareholders are entitled to vote on the share exchange; (iii) disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the corporation, if the shareholders are entitled to vote on the disposition; or (iv) an amendment to
the articles of incorporation that reduces the number of shares owned by the shareholders to a fraction of a share
if the corporation has the obligation or right to repurchase the fractional shares.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Virginia SCA further provides that appraisal rights are not available to holders
of shares of any class or series of shares of a Virginia corporation in a merger when the stock is either (x) listed
on a national securities exchange, such as the NASDAQ Global Market, or (y) is traded on an organized market,
held by at least 2,000 shareholders of record and has a public float of at least $20 million. Despite these
exceptions, appraisal rights will be available to holders of capital stock of a Virginia corporation in one of the
applicable corporate actions if: (i) the articles of incorporation provide for appraisal rights regardless of an
available exception (although neither the SONA articles of incorporation nor the EVBS articles of incorporation
authorize such special appraisal rights); (ii) in the case of a merger or share exchange, shareholders are required
by the terms of the corporate action to accept anything for their shares other than (A) cash or (B) shares of the
surviving or acquiring corporation, or any other proprietary interest of any other entity, that are either listed on a
national securities exchange or traded on an organized market, held by more than 2,000 shareholders of record
and have a public float of at least $20 million, or a combination of cash or such shares; or (iii) the corporate
action is an “interested transaction” as defined in the Virginia SCA.

SONA EVBS
SONA’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ
Global Market. Therefore, unless one of the exceptions
outlined above applies to a given transaction,
shareholders of SONA are not entitled to appraisal
rights.

Shareholders of SONA are not entitled to appraisal
rights in connection with the merger.

EVBS’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market. Therefore, unless one of the
exceptions outlined above applies to a given
transaction, common shareholders of EVBS are not
entitled to appraisal rights. EVBS’s preferred stock is
not listed on a national securities exchange or traded
on an organized market and, therefore, are generally
entitled to appraisal rights in applicable transactions.

Common shareholders of EVBS are not entitled to
appraisal rights in connection with the merger. All
holders of EVBS preferred stock have consented to the
merger, and under the Virginia law no such holder can
exercise appraisal rights with respect to the EVBS
preferred stock.

Merger; Sale of All or Substantially All of a Corporation’s Assets; Plans of Dissolution
SONA EVBS

The Virginia SCA provides that, unless a corporation’s
articles of incorporation provide for a greater or lesser
vote, certain significant corporate actions must be
approved by the affirmative vote of more than two-
thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
Certain corporate actions requiring a more than two-
thirds vote include: (i) adoption of plans of merger or
share exchange; (ii) sales or other dispositions of all or
substantially all of a corporation’s assets other than in

The EVBS articles of incorporation provide that the
approval of a majority vote of the votes entitled to be
cast by each voting group entitled to vote is required to
approve (i) adoption of plans of merger or share
exchange and (ii) sales or other dispositions of all or
substantially all of EVBS’s property, otherwise than in
the usual and regular course of business, provided that
if such corporate action was not approved by at least
two-thirds of EVBS’s directors, holders of more than
two-thirds of the

The Virginia SCA provides that a corporation’s articles
may either increase the vote required to approve those
actions or may decrease the vote required to not less
than a majority of all the votes cast by each voting
group entitled to vote at a meeting at which a quorum
of the voting group exists. SONA’s articles of

must vote in favor of the amendment, and provided
further that the EVBS board of directors may condition
its submission of any such corporate action on any
basis, including the requirement of a greater vote.

The EVBS articles of incorporation do not modify the
vote required to approve adoption of a plan of
dissolution.

Anti-takeover Provisions
Affiliated Transactions Statute.   The Affiliated Transaction Statute of the Virginia SCA contains provisions
governing “affiliated transactions.” These include various transactions such as mergers, share exchanges, sales,
leases, or other dispositions of material assets, issuances of securities, dissolutions, and similar transactions with
an “interested shareholder.” An interested shareholder is generally the beneficial owner of more than 10% of any
class of a corporation’s outstanding voting shares. During the three years following the date a shareholder
becomes an interested shareholder, any affiliated transaction with the interested shareholder must be approved by
both a majority (but not less than two) of the “disinterested directors” (those directors who were directors before
the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder or who were recommended for election by a majority
of the disinterested directors) and by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the corporation’s voting
shares other than shares beneficially owned by the interested shareholder.

These requirements do not apply to affiliated transactions if, among other things, a majority of the disinterested
directors approve the interested shareholder’s acquisition of voting shares making such a person an interested
shareholder before such acquisition. Beginning three years after the shareholder becomes an interested
shareholder, the corporation may engage in an affiliated transaction with the interested shareholder if: (i) the
transaction is approved by the holders of two-thirds of the corporation’s voting shares, other than shares
beneficially owned by the interested shareholder; (ii) the affiliated transaction has been approved by a majority of
the disinterested directors; or (iii) subject to certain additional requirements, in the affiliated transaction the
holders of each class or series of voting shares will receive consideration meeting specified fair price and other
requirements designed to ensure that all shareholders receive fair and equivalent consideration, regardless of
when they tendered their shares.

A Virginia corporation may include in its articles of incorporation initially filed with the Virginia SCC a
provision opting out of the Affiliated Transactions Statute. The shareholders of a Virginia corporation may also
adopt an amendment to the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws opting out of the Affiliated
Transactions Statute.

Control Share Acquisitions Statute.   Under the Virginia SCA’s Control Share Acquisitions Statute, voting rights
of shares of stock of a Virginia corporation acquired by an acquiring person or other entity at ownership levels of
20%, 33 ⁄3%, and 50% of the outstanding shares may, under certain circumstances, be denied.

The voting rights may be denied: (i) unless conferred by a special shareholder vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors, other than shares held by the acquiring person and officers and
directors of the corporation; or (ii) among other exceptions, such acquisition of shares is made pursuant to a
merger agreement with the corporation or the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws permit the
acquisition of such shares before the acquiring person’s acquisition thereof.

If authorized in the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, the statute also permits the corporation to
redeem the acquired shares at the average per share price paid for such shares if the voting rights are not
approved or if the acquiring person does not file a “control share acquisition statement” with the corporation
within 60 days of the last acquisition of such shares. If voting rights are approved for

materials for such meeting has already passed. For any shareholder proposal to be presented in connection with
the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders of SONA but without inclusion in SONA’s proxy materials, the
shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of SONA. To be timely, a
shareholder’s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of SONA not
later than 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting. The deadline for
shareholders to submit a proposal for inclusion in SONA’s proxy materials for its 2018 annual meeting of
shareholders will be set forth in SONA’s proxy statement for its 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, which has
yet to be released to its shareholders as of the date of this joint proxy statement/ prospectus.

EVBS

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, EVBS intends to hold its 2017 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders only if the merger is not completed. However, if the merger is not completed, or if EVBS is
otherwise required to do so under applicable law, EVBS will hold a 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders at a
future date, and in that event EVBS will publicly announce the date of such meeting and the deadline for
submission of shareholder proposals for such meeting.

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of
December 13, 2016, between SOUTHERN NATIONAL BANCORP OF VIRGINIA, INC., a Virginia
corporation (“SONA”), and EASTERN VIRGINIA BANKSHARES, INC., a Virginia corporation (“EVBS”).

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of SONA and EVBS have unanimously approved, and deem it
advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders to consummate, the business combination
transaction provided for herein in which EVBS will merge with and into SONA (the “Merger”);

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of EVBS and SONA have each determined that the Merger is
consistent with and will further their respective business strategies and goals; and

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify
as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”), and that this Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a “plan of reorganization” for purposes
of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of such EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series
B Preferred Stock have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Such letter of transmittal shall permit each
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to elect to receive, in lieu of shares of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock or Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, as applicable, represented by book-entry
registry, a physical stock certificate representing shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock or Continuing
Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, as applicable, payable pursuant to this Article 2.

(d) Upon the Effective Date, each holder of an outstanding share of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series
B Preferred Stock who has properly surrendered such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates), together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably require, (i) (x) the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing EVBS Common Stock

compliance with reasonable conditions imposed by the Continuing Corporation and the Exchange Agent pursuant

standard policy (including the requirement that the shareholder furnish an affidavit of lost certificate, surety bond
or other customary indemnity).

(f) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by SONA;
provided, that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration or any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable to holders of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock entitled to
receive such consideration, and SONA shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of holders of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock in the amount of any such losses
to the extent necessary for payment of the Merger Consideration. Any interest or other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to SONA or as directed by SONA. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any
interest or other income earned thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of EVBS Common Stock and
EVBS Series B Preferred Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Date shall, to the extent permitted by
law, be paid to the Continuing Corporation. Any former holders of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Continuing
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions on Continuing
Corporation Common Stock or Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock deliverable in respect of
each former share of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.

Section 2.4 Rights of Former Holders of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock.

At the Effective Date, the stock transfer books of EVBS shall be closed as to holders of EVBS Common
Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock, and no transfer of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred
Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.3, each Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall from and after the Effective Date
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in exchange
therefor. To the extent permitted by law, former holders of record of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Date at any meeting of Continuing Corporation
shareholders the number of whole shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock into which their respective
shares of EVBS Common Stock and EVBS Series B Preferred Stock are converted, regardless of whether such
holders have surrendered their Book-Entry Shares or Certificates for exchange as provided in Section 2.3, but
beginning thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, no such holder shall be entitled to vote on any matter until
such holder surrenders such Certificate or Book-Entry Share for exchange as provided in Article 2. Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by the Continuing Corporation on Continuing Corporation Common
Stock or Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Date, the declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this
Agreement, but no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of EVBS Common Stock or
EVBS Series B Preferred Stock, if any, as of any time subsequent to the Effective Date shall be delivered to the
holder of any Book-Entry Share or Certificate issued and outstanding at the Effective Date until such holder
surrenders such Book-Entry Share or Certificate for exchange as provided in Section 2.3. However, upon
surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate representing EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock, the Merger Consideration, together with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions
without interest, shall be delivered and paid with respect to each Book-Entry Share or other share represented by
such Certificate.

Option”) granted under an equity or equity-based compensation plan of EVBS (an “EVBS Stock Plan”) that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall vest and be converted into and become an option to
purchase shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock (each, an “Assumed Option”), and the Continuing
Corporation shall assume each Assumed Option, in accordance with the terms of the EVBS Stock Plan and award
agreement by which it is evidenced, except that (i) each Assumed Option assumed by

the Continuing Corporation may be exercised solely for shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock, (ii)
the number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option shall be equal
to the number of shares of EVBS Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option immediately prior to the
Effective Date multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounding down to the nearest share and (iii) the per share
exercise price of such Assumed Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price of such
Assumed Option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
method of adjusting each Assumed Option that is intended to be an “incentive stock option” (as defined in
Section 422 of the Code) shall comply with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder and the method of adjusting all other Assumed Options shall comply with Section 409A
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification of such Assumed
Option that would cause such Assumed Option to violate Code Section 409A. At the Effective Date, the
Continuing Corporation shall assume the EVBS Stock Plans; provided that such assumption shall only be with
respect to the Assumed Options, and the Continuing Corporation shall have no obligation to make any additional
grants or awards under the EVBS Stock Plans.

(b) The Continuing Corporation shall deliver to the holders of Assumed Options, as soon as practicable after
the Effective Date, any required notices setting forth such holders’ rights pursuant to the Assumed Option and
stating that such Assumed Option has been issued by the Continuing Corporation and shall continue in effect on
the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.5).

(c) At the Effective Date, each share of EVBS Common Stock subject to time-based or performance-based
vesting restrictions granted under a EVBS Stock Plan (a “EVBS Stock Award”) that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Date shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable and shall be converted automatically into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration, less the amount of
any required withholding Tax, and the shares of EVBS Common Stock subject to such EVBS Stock Award will
be treated in the same manner as all other shares of EVBS Common Stock for such purposes.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Date, EVBS, the Board of Directors of EVBS or a committee thereof, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 2.5, including, but not limited to, delivering a notice of a change of control event under the terms of
the EVBS Stock Plans at least thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Date.

Section 2.6 No Fractional Shares.

Each holder of shares of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock exchanged pursuant to
the Merger which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock or Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, as applicable, shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a
share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock or Continuing Corporation Non-Voting Common Stock, as
applicable, multiplied by the closing sale price of SONA Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market for the
trading day immediately preceding (but not including) the Effective Date.

Section 2.7 Withholding Rights.

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as
defined herein) law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Authority by the Exchange Agent, such amounts withheld will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange
Agent.

appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more of such party’s representations or warranties contained in Section 3.3 or to one or more
of its covenants or agreements contained in Articles 4 or 5; provided, that (i) no such item is required to be set
forth in a party’s Disclosure Letter as an exception to any representation or warranty of such party if its absence
would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard

a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by that party that such item represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined herein) with respect to such party.

(b) Any disclosures made with respect to a subsection of Section 3.3 shall be deemed to qualify (i) any
subsections of Section 3.3 specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (ii) other subsections of Section 3.3 to

such disclosure or (F) a decline in the trading price of a party’s common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to

Subject to and giving effect to Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 and except as set forth in the relevant Disclosure
Letters or in any of such party’s SEC Reports (as defined below) filed on or after January 1, 2016 and prior to the

specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), SONA represents and warrants to EVBS, to the
extent applicable, and EVBS represents and warrants to SONA, to the extent applicable, as follows:

(a) Organization, Standing and Power. It is a Virginia corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of Virginia. It has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now
conducted and to own, lease and operate its assets, properties and business. It is duly registered as a bank holding
company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. It is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified is not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision
of the Organizational Documents or such articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of such Subsidiary, as applicable. True and complete copies of its Articles of
Incorporation, Bylaws or other similar governing instruments (the “Organizational Documents”), in each case as
amended to the date hereof and as in full force and effect as of the date hereof have been made available to the
other party.

(b) Subsidiaries. Each of its Subsidiaries (i) is a duly organized bank, corporation or statutory trust, validly
existing and in good standing under applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized,
(ii) has full corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and to own, lease and
operate its assets, properties and business, and (iii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned
or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or

generality of the foregoing and except as otherwise set forth in Section 3.3(o)(ix) of its Disclosure Letter, no
amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by it or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an “excess parachute payment”
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Except as set forth in Section 3.3(o)(ix) of its Disclosure
Letter, no Benefit Plan maintained by it or any of its Subsidiaries provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise.

(x) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(o)(x) of its Disclosure Letter, it and its Subsidiaries have made
prior to the date hereof all bonus and commission payments to which they were required or are otherwise
committed to make to any employee or independent contractor under any Benefit Plan for calendar years
2013, 2014 and 2015.

(xi) Each Benefit Plan of it and its Subsidiaries that is a health or welfare plan has terms that are in
compliance with and has been administered in accordance with the requirements of the ACA. It and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all respects with the requirements of Section 4980H of the Code so as to
avoid the imposition of any taxes or assessable payments thereunder. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any liability or obligation to provide postretirement health, medical or life insurance benefits to any
employees or former employees, leased employees, independent contractors, officers, or directors, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, except as otherwise required under state or federal benefits continuation
laws. In the case of any such required continuation coverage, the covered individual is required to pay the
full cost of coverage. No tax under Code Sections 4980B, 4980H or 5000 has been incurred with respect to
any Benefit Plan of it or its Subsidiaries, it, or any of its Subsidiaries, and no circumstance exists which
could give rise to such tax.

(p) Insurance. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, it and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers against such risks and in such
amounts as its management reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry practices, and
are in compliance in all material respects with their insurance policies and are not in default under any of the
terms thereof. Each such insurance policy is outstanding and in full force and effect, and, except for policies
insuring against potential liabilities of officers, directors and employees of it and its Subsidiaries, it or its relevant
Subsidiary is the sole named beneficiary of such policies, and all premiums and other payments due under any
such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion. Since
December 31, 2015, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of a premium increase or
cancellation or a failure to renew with respect to any insurance policy or bond or, within the last three (3)
calendar years and since January 1, 2016 has been refused any insurance coverage sought or applied for, and it
has no reason to believe that existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when the same shall expire
upon terms and conditions as favorable as those presently in effect, other than possible increases in premiums or
unavailability of coverage that do not result from any extraordinary loss experience on the part of it or its
Subsidiaries. Set forth in Section 3.3(p) of its Disclosure Letter is a list of all insurance policies or bonds
currently maintained by it and its Subsidiaries.

with, any person or entity that makes an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to such
party (that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.5) if, and only to the extent that (i) such party’s board of
directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
actions would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under
applicable law, (ii) before taking such action, such party receives from such person or entity an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less restrictive with respect to the confidential treatment of information by

any person given such access shall have previously been provided to the other party or shall be provided to the
other party prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such person, and (iii) such party’s board of

more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the party; or (iii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 20% or more of any

purposes of this definition of  “Superior Proposal,” the Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in Section 5.5(c), except the reference to “20% or more” in such definition shall be deemed to be a
reference to “50%” and “Acquisition Proposal” shall only be deemed to refer to a transaction involving EVBS or

SONA, nor, in each case, any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the

approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors of EVBS or SONA, as
applicable, or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(a “Change in EVBS Recommendation” or a “Change in SONA Recommendation,” respectively).

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the
Board of Directors of EVBS or SONA, as applicable, may either:

(i) enter into a definitive agreement to accept a Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(j) or Section 7.1(k), as the case may be, provided that such party shall pay the
Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to Section 7.4(b) or Section 7.4(d), as the case may be; or

(ii) make a Change in EVBS Recommendation or a Change in SONA Recommendation, as applicable,
if and only if  (A) an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.5) is made to EVBS or SONA, as applicable, by a third party, and such Acquisition Proposal
is not withdrawn, (B) the Board of Directors of EVBS or SONA, as applicable, has concluded in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the Board of Directors of EVBS or SONA, as applicable, have
concluded in good faith (after consultation with their outside legal counsel) that failure to make a Change in
EVBS Recommendation or a Change in SONA Recommendation, as applicable, would be reasonably likely
to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable law, (D) five (5) business
days shall have elapsed since the party proposing to take such action has given written notice to the other
party advising such other party that the notifying party intends to take such action and specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal
that is the basis of the proposed action (a “Notice of Recommendation Change”) (it being understood that
any amendment to any material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice of
Recommendation Change, except that, in such case, the five (5) business day period referred to in this clause
(D) and in clauses (E) and (F) shall be reduced to three (3) business days following the giving of such new
Notice of Recommendation Change), (E) during such five (5) business day period, the notifying party has
considered and, at the reasonable request of the other party, engaged in good faith discussions with such
party regarding, any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other party,
and (F) the board of directors of the party proposing to take such action, following such five (5) business day
period, again reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisors, and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the other party) that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
to its shareholders under applicable law.

Corporation.

(c) Prior to the Effective Date, EVBS shall one hundred percent vest all accrued benefits provided under the
VBA Defined Contribution Plan for Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (the “EVBS 401(k) Plan”), subject to
consummation of the Merger. SONA and EVBS shall use reasonable efforts to take such action as may be
necessary to merge the EVBS 401(k) Plan and the VBA Defined Contribution Plan for Sonabank (the “SONA
401(k) Plan” and together with the EVBS 401(k) Plan, each a “401(k) Plan”), with the specifics and timing of
such merger to be determined by the parties in good faith. In the event the parties determine that the merger of the
401(k) Plans is to occur after the Effective Date, then prior to the Effective Date, each party agrees to amend its
401(k) Plan to insure that there is no duplication of participation or benefits in the 401(k) Plans.

(d) With regard to the VBA Cash Balance Pension Plan for Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (the “EVBS
Cash Balance Plan”), unless agreed upon otherwise in writing by the parties hereto, prior to the Effective Date,
EVBS will fully fund the EVBS Cash Balance Plan as calculated by the EVBS Cash Balance Plan’s actuary on a
plan termination basis to ensure that there is no funding deficiency as of the Effective Date. In addition, prior to
the Effective Date, EVBS shall amend the EVBS Cash Balance Plan and take such other actions as necessary,
effective as of the Effective Date or such earlier time agreed upon by the parties, to terminate the EVBS Cash
Balance Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable law and provide for 100% vesting to all affected
participants in the EVBS Cash Balance Plan. The parties agree that the EVBS Cash Balance Plan will be
submitted to the IRS for a determination letter following its termination and distributions from the EVBS Cash
Balance Plan shall be made in accordance with plan terms and applicable law after receipt of a favorable
determination letter.

(e) Prior to the Effective Date, EVBS and SONA will determine if any Benefit Plans of EVBS or SONA not
otherwise addressed in this Agreement are to be terminated prior to the Effective Date. If the parties hereto agree
that any such Benefit Plans are to be terminated, EVBS or SONA, as appropriate, shall take all steps necessary to
terminate any such Benefit Plans immediately preceding the Effective Date and pay any benefits due thereunder
in accordance with the terms of any such plan and/or in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, if applicable.

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be construed to limit the right of the Continuing Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Date, to amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans maintained by
SONA or EVBS or their respective Subsidiaries before the Effective Date to the extent such amendment or
termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan.

Section 5.10 Reservation of Shares; NASDAQ Listing.

(a) SONA shall take all corporate action as may be necessary to authorize and reserve for issuance such
number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement, and to
cause all such shares, when issued pursuant to this Agreement, to be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable.

(b) SONA shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of the Continuing Corporation Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ Global Market, subject to official
notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event before the Effective Date.

Section 5.11 Indemnification.

(a) Following the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless any person who has rights to indemnification from EVBS or any of its
Subsidiaries (an “Indemnified Party”) (in all capacities), to the same extent and on the same conditions as such
person was entitled to indemnification pursuant to applicable law and EVBS’s Organizational Documents or any
EVBS Subsidiary’s Organizational Documents, as the case may be, as in effect on the date of this Agreement
(including advancing expenses when requested, subject to such person’s

compliance with Section 13.1-699 of the VSCA). Without limiting the foregoing, in any case or proceeding in
which corporate approval may be required to effectuate any indemnification, the Continuing Corporation or its
applicable Subsidiary shall direct, if any Indemnified Party elects, that the determination of permissibility of
indemnification shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon between the Continuing
Corporation or such Subsidiary and such Indemnified Party.

(b) The Continuing Corporation shall, at or prior to the Effective Date, purchase a six (6) year “tail” prepaid
policy on the same terms and conditions as the existing directors’ and officers’ liability (and fiduciary) insurance
maintained by EVBS from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, covering, without limitation, the
Merger; provided, however, that the cost of such “tail” policy shall in no event exceed three hundred percent
(300%) of the amount of the last annual premium paid by EVBS for such existing directors’ and officers’ liability
(and fiduciary) insurance. If, but for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Continuing
Corporation would be required to expend more than three hundred percent (300%) of current annual premiums,
the Continuing Corporation will obtain the maximum amount of that insurance obtainable by payment of annual
premiums equal to three hundred percent (300%) of current annual premiums.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to
EVBS or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.11 is not prior to or in substitution
for any such claims under such policies.

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party
and his or her respective heirs and legal representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement and the
other rights provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party
is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

Section 5.12 Employment and Other Arrangements.
(a) Except for employees of EVBS, SONA and their respective Subsidiaries with individual agreements that

provide for payment of severance under certain circumstances or employees of EVBS and its Subsidiaries
covered by the EVBS Executive Severance Plan (who will be paid severance only in accordance with such
agreements or plan), SONA and EVBS agree that each employee of EVBS, SONA and their respective
Subsidiaries who is involuntarily terminated by EVBS or SONA, respectively, following the date of this
Agreement but before the Effective Date, or by the Continuing Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
for cause) on or within six (6) months following the Effective Date (the “Severance Coverage Period”) shall
receive a severance payment equal to two weeks of base pay (at the rate in effect on the termination date) for each
year of service at EVBS, SONA or their respective Subsidiaries, respectively, (with credit for partial years of
service) with a maximum payment equal to twenty-six weeks of base pay. A former employee of EVBS, SONA
or their respective Subsidiaries must execute a general release of claims before any severance payment shall be
made pursuant to this Section 5.12(a), and all such releases of claims shall be in a form approved in writing in
advance by SONA. After the expiration of the Severance Coverage Period, the foregoing severance benefit may
be changed, replaced or discontinued in its entirety in the sole discretion of the Continuing Corporation or its
Subsidiaries.

(b) EVBS and SONA will establish a retention bonus pool that will be dedicated to certain of their non-
executive officer employees for purposes of retaining such employees prior to and after the Effective Date, with
the participating employees and specific terms of such retention bonuses to be determined by EVBS and SONA.

(c) EVBS hereby acknowledges that the Merger will result in a “change in control” of SONA or other event
of similar import, within the meaning of the Change in Control Agreement by and between SONA and Georgia S.
Derrico, the Change in Control Agreement by and between SONA and Rod Porter, the Change in Control
Agreement by and between SONA and Thomas Baker, the Change in Control Agreement by and between SONA

case in exchange for payment to Ms. Derrico, Mr. Porter and Mr. Baker, respectively, of an amount representing

surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate representing EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B
Preferred Stock, the Merger Consideration, together with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions
without interest, shall be delivered and paid with respect to each Book-Entry Share or other share represented by
such Certificate.

2.4 EVBS Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards.

(a) At the Effective Date, each option to purchase shares of EVBS Common Stock (an “EVBS Stock
Option”) granted under an equity or equity-based compensation plan of EVBS (an “EVBS Stock Plan”) that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall vest and be converted into and become an option to
purchase shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock (each, an “Assumed Option”), and the Continuing
Corporation shall assume each Assumed Option, in accordance with the terms of the EVBS Stock Plan and award
agreement by which it is evidenced, except that (i) each Assumed Option assumed by the Continuing Corporation
may be exercised solely for shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(ii) the number of shares of Continuing Corporation Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option shall be
equal to the number of shares of EVBS Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option immediately prior to the
Effective Date multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounding down to the nearest share and (iii) the per share
exercise price of such Assumed Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price of such
Assumed Option by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
method of adjusting each Assumed Option that is intended to be an “incentive stock option” (as defined in
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) shall comply with the requirements
of Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the method of adjusting all other
Assumed Options shall comply with Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as
not to constitute a modification of such Assumed Option that would cause such Assumed Option to violate Code
Section 409A. At the Effective Date, the Continuing Corporation shall assume the EVBS Stock Plans; provided
that such assumption shall only be with respect to the Assumed Options, and the Continuing Corporation shall
have no obligation to make any additional grants or awards under the EVBS Stock Plans.

(b) The Continuing Corporation shall deliver to the holders of Assumed Options, as soon as practicable after
the Effective Date, any required notices setting forth such holders’ rights pursuant to the Assumed Option and
stating that such Assumed Option has been issued by the Continuing Corporation and shall continue in effect on
the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.4).

(c) At the Effective Date, each share of EVBS Common Stock subject to time-based or performance-based
vesting restrictions granted under a EVBS Stock Plan (a “EVBS Stock Award”) that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Date shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable and shall be converted automatically into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration, less the amount of
any required withholding Tax (as defined in the Agreement), and the shares of EVBS Common Stock subject to
such EVBS Stock Award will be treated in the same manner as all other shares of EVBS Common Stock for such
purposes.

2.5 No Fractional Shares.

Each holder of shares of EVBS Common Stock or EVBS Series B Preferred Stock exchanged pursuant to
the Merger which would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Continuing Corporation
Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of Continuing Corporation Common Stock multiplied by the closing sale
price of SONA Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Market for the trading day immediately preceding (but
not including) the Effective Date.

2.6 Withholding Rights.

The Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger to any person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in the Agreement) law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority (as defined in the Agreement) by the Exchange
Agent, such amounts withheld will be treated for all purposes of this Plan of Merger as having been paid to such
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.

ARTICLE 3 
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Continuing Corporation

The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of SONA as in effect on the Effective Date will be the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Continuing Corporation.

ARTICLE 4

Suite 100 
McLean, VA 22101

Members of the Board of Directors:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio
(defined below) in connection with the proposed merger (the “Merger”) of Southern National Bancorp of
Virginia, Inc. (“SONA”) and Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (“EVBS”) subject to the terms and conditions of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 13, 2016 (the “Agreement”).

Pursuant to the Agreement, each share of EVBS common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive 0.6313 shares of SONA common stock
(“the “Exchange Ratio”). The terms of the Merger are set forth more fully in the Agreement.

FIG Partners, LLC (“FIG”), as part of its investment banking business, is routinely engaged in the valuation
of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings,
competitive bidding, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations
for estate, corporate and other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, we have
experience and knowledge of, the valuation of banking institutions. This opinion has been reviewed by FIG’s
compliance officer consistent with internal policy. FIG has been engaged by SONA during the prior two years
and we have received compensation for services provided.

We were retained by SONA to act as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger and in rendering
this opinion. We will receive compensation from SONA in connection with our services and SONA has agreed to
indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

During the course of our engagement and for the purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

(ix) reviewed the terms of recent merger and acquisition transactions, to the extent publicly available,
involving banks and bank holding companies that we considered relevant; and

(x) performed such other analyses and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

We also took into account our assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and our
experience in other transactions as well as our knowledge of the banking industry and our general experience in
securities valuation.

In rendering this opinion, we have assumed and relied on, without independent verification, the accuracy
and completeness of the financial and other information and representations contained in the materials provided
to us by SONA and EVBS in the discussions with the Company. In that regard, we have assumed that the
financial forecasts, including, without limitation, the Synergies and projections have been reasonably prepared on
a basis reflecting the best currently-available information and judgments and estimates of SONA and EVBS, and
that such forecasts will be realized in the amounts and at the times contemplated thereby. We are not experts in
the evaluation of loan and lease portfolios for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the allowances for losses
with respect thereto and have assumed that such allowances for SONA and EVBS are in the aggregate adequate
to cover such losses. We were not retained to and did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or
facilities of SONA and EVBS. In addition, we have not reviewed individual credit files nor have we made an
independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of SONA and EVBS or any of their respective
subsidiaries and we were not furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals.

We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated substantially in accordance with the terms set forth
in the Agreement. We have further assumed that the Merger will be accounted for as a purchase under generally
accepted accounting principles. We have assumed that the Merger is, and will be, in compliance with all laws and
regulations that are applicable to SONA and EVBS. In rendering this opinion, we have been advised by SONA
and EVBS and we have assumed that there are no factors that would impede any necessary regulatory or
governmental approval of the Merger.

The opinion is based solely upon the information available to us and the economic, market and other
circumstances, as they exist as of the date hereof. Events occurring and information that becomes available after
the date hereof could materially affect the assumptions and analyses used in preparing this opinion. We have not
undertaken to reaffirm or revise this opinion or otherwise comment upon any events occurring or information that
becomes available after the date hereof, except as otherwise agreed in our engagement letter.

This letter is solely for the information of the Board of Directors of SONA and is not to be used, circulated,
quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose, nor is it to be filed with, included in or referred to in whole
or in part in any proxy statement or any other document, except in each case in accordance with our prior written
consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that we hereby consent to the inclusion
and reference to this letter in any proxy statement, registration statement or information statement to be delivered
to the holders of SONA and EVBS common stock in connection with the Merger if and only if this letter is
quoted in full or attached as an exhibit to such document and this letter has not been withdrawn prior to the date
of such document.

Subject to the foregoing and based on our experience as investment bankers, our activities and assumptions
as described above, and other factors we have deemed relevant, we are of the opinion as of the date hereof that
the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of SONA.

Sincerely,

FIG PARTNERS, LLC

Board of Directors 
Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc. 
330 Hospital Road 
Tappahannock, VA 22560

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (the “EVBS”) and Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc. (“SONA”)
are proposing to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which EVBS will
merge with and into SONA, with SONA being the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement, at the Effective Date, each share of common stock, par value $2.00 per share, of EVBS (“EVBS
Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date, except for certain shares of
EVBS Common Stock as specified in the Agreement, will be converted into the right to receive 0.6313 shares
(the “Exchange Ratio”) of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of SONA (“SONA Common Stock”).
Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement. The
terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement. You have requested our opinion as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio to the holders of EVBS Common Stock.

Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. (“Sandler O’Neill”, “we” or “our”), as part of its investment banking
business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions. In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed and
considered, among other things: (i) a draft of the Agreement, dated December 13, 2016; (ii) certain publicly
available financial statements and other historical financial information of EVBS that we deemed relevant; (iii)
certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of SONA that we deemed
relevant; (iv) publicly available consensus median analyst estimates for EVBS for the years ending December 31,
2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated long-term annual earnings and balance
sheet growth rates for EVBS for the years thereafter, as reviewed with and confirmed by the senior management
of EVBS; (v) publicly available consensus analyst estimates for SONA for the years ending December 31, 2016
and December 31, 2017, as well as estimated long-term annual earnings and balance sheet growth rates for the
years thereafter, as provided by the senior management of SONA and their representatives and as adjusted by the
senior management of SONA for the offer and sale of  $25 million of subordinated notes by SONA with a coupon
of 6.5%; (vi) the pro forma financial impact of the Merger on SONA based on certain assumptions relating to
purchase accounting adjustments, cost savings and transaction expenses, as provided by the senior management
of SONA; (vii) the relative contribution of assets, liabilities, equity and earnings of EVBS and SONA to the
combined entity; (viii) the publicly reported historical price and trading activity for EVBS Common Stock and
SONA Common Stock, including a comparison of certain stock market information for EVBS CommonStock
and SONA Common Stock and certain stock indices as well as publicly available information for certain other
similar companies, the securities of which are publicly traded; (ix) a comparison of certain financial information
for EVBS and SONA with similar institutions for which information is publicly available; (x) the financial terms
of certain recent business combinations in the bank and thrift industry on a nationwide basis, to the extent
publicly available; (xi) the current market environment generally and the banking environment in particular; and
(xii) such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market
criteria as we considered relevant. We also discussed with certain members of the senior management of EVBS
the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of EVBS and held similar discussions with
certain members of the senior management of SONA regarding the business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects of SONA.

In performing our review, we have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and
other information that was available to and reviewed by us from public sources, that was provided to us by EVBS
or SONA or their respective representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by us, and we have

TABLE OF CONTENTS

assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering this opinion without any independent
verification or investigation. We have relied on the assurances of the respective managements of EVBS and
SONA that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make any of such information inaccurate
or misleading. We have not been asked to and have not undertaken an independent verification of any of such
information and we do not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. We did
not make an independent evaluation or perform an appraisal of the specific assets, the collateral securing assets or
the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of EVBS or SONA or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor have we
been furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. We render no opinion or evaluation on the collectability
of any assets or the future performance of any loans of EVBS or SONA. We did not make an independent
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of EVBS or SONA, or of the combined entity after
the Merger, and we have not reviewed any individual credit files relating to EVBS or SONA. We have assumed,
with your consent, that the respective allowances for loan losses for both EVBS and SONA are adequate to cover
such losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the combined entity.

In preparing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus median analyst estimates for
EVBS for the years ending December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated
long-term annual earnings and balance sheet growth rates for EVBS for the years thereafter, as reviewed with and
confirmed by the senior management of EVBS. In addition, Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus
analyst estimates for SONA for the years ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, as well as
estimated long-term annual earnings and balance sheet growth rates for the years thereafter, as provided by the
senior management of SONA and their representatives and as adjusted by the senior management of SONA.
Sandler O’Neill also received and used in its pro forma analyses certain assumptions relating to purchase
accounting adjustments, cost savings and transaction expenses, as provided by the senior management of SONA.
With respect to the foregoing information, the respective senior managements of EVBS and SONA confirmed to
us that such information reflected (or, in the case of the publicly available consensus analyst estimates referred to
above, were consistent with) the best currently available estimates and judgments of those respective senior
managements as to the future financial performance of EVBS and SONA, respectively, and the other matters
covered thereby, and we assumed that the future financial performance reflected in such information would be
achieved. We express no opinion as to such information, or the assumptions on which such information is based.
We have also assumed that there has been no material change in the respective assets, financial condition, results
of operations, business or prospects of EVBS or SONA since the date of the most recent financial statements
made available to us. We have assumed in all respects material to our analysis that EVBS and SONA will remain
as going concerns for all periods relevant to our analysis.

We have also assumed, with your consent, that (i) each of the parties to the Agreement will comply in all
material respects with all material terms and conditions of the Agreement and all related agreements, that all of
the representations and warranties contained in such agreements are true and correct in all material respects, that
each of the parties to such agreements will perform in all material respects all of the covenants and other
obligations required to be performed by such party under such agreements and that the conditions precedent in
such agreements are not and will not be waived, (ii) in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third
party approvals, consents and releases with respect to the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition
will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on EVBS, SONA or the Merger or any related transaction, (iii)
the Merger and any related transactions will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement
without any waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof and in
compliance with all applicable laws and other requirements, and (iv) the Merger will qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Finally, with your consent, we have relied upon the advice that
EVBS has received from its legal, accounting and tax advisors as to all legal, accounting and tax matters relating
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement. We express no opinion as to any such
matters.

Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof could materially
affect this opinion. We have not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this opinion

or otherwise comment upon events occurring after the date hereof. We express no opinion as to the trading values
of EVBS Common Stock or SONA Common Stock at any time or what the value of SONA Common Stock will
be once it is actually received by the holders of EVBS Common Stock.

We have acted as EVBS’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our
services which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. We will also receive a fee for rendering this
opinion, which opinion fee will be credited in full towards the transaction fee which will become payable to
Sandler O’Neill on the day of closing of the Merger. EVBS has also agreed to indemnify us against certain claims
and liabilities arising out of our engagement and to reimburse us for certain of our out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with our engagement. In April 2015, Sandler O’Neill acted as placement agent to EVBS in
connection with the offer and sale by EVBS of subordinated notes for which Sandler O’Neill received a
customary investment banking fee. Except for the foregoing, we have not provided any other investment banking
services to EVBS in the two years preceding the date of this opinion nor have we provided any investment
banking services to SONA in the two years preceding the date of this opinion. In the ordinary course of our
business as a broker-dealer, we may purchase securities from and sell securities to EVBS, SONA and their
respective affiliates. We may also actively trade the equity and debt securities of EVBS, SONA and their
respective affiliates for our own account and for the accounts of our customers.

Our opinion is directed to the Board of Directors of EVBS in connection with its consideration of the
Agreement and the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of EVBS as to how any
such shareholder should vote at any meeting of shareholders called to consider and vote upon the approval of the
Agreement and the Merger. Our opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
Exchange Ratio to the holders of EVBS Common Stock and does not address the underlying business decision of
EVBS to engage in the Merger, the form or structure of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated in the
Agreement, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative transactions or business
strategies that might exist for EVBS or the effect of any other transaction in which EVBS might engage. We also
do not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to be received in the
Merger by any officer, director or employee of EVBS or SONA, or any class of such persons, if any, relative to
the compensation to be received in the Merger by any other shareholder. This opinion has been approved by
Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion committee. This opinion shall not be reproduced without Sandler O’Neill’s
prior written consent; provided, however, Sandler O’Neill will provide its consent for the opinion to be included
in regulatory filings to be completed in connection with the Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is
fair to holders of EVBS Common Stock from a financial point of view.

Very truly yours,

/s/ Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P.
