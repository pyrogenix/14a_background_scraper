September 5, 2018

Dear Stockholder:

        You are cordially invited to attend the Special Meeting of Stockholders of Web.com Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "Web.com"). The special meeting (the
"Special Meeting") will be held on October 10, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time, at 12808 Gran Bay Parkway West, Jacksonville, Florida 32258. Only holders of record of Company common
stock at the close of business on August 30, 2018, will be entitled to vote at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting.

        At the Special Meeting, we will ask you to vote for the adoption of the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 5, 2018, by and among Parker Private
Holdings II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Parent"), Parker Private Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger Sub"),
and Web.com, as it may be amended from time to time, (as so amended, the "Merger Agreement") which provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Web.com (the "Merger"), with
Web.com continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger (the
"Merger Proposal").

        We are also asking you (a) to approve, on an advisory basis, the Merger-related compensation that may be paid or become payable to Web.com's named executive officers (the "Executive
Compensation Proposal"), and (b) to approve the adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting, if necessary, to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at
the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Proposal (the "Adjournment Proposal").

        If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $28.00 in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes (the "Merger Consideration"), for each share of
Web.com common stock that you own, and you will have no ongoing ownership interest in the continuing business of Web.com. The Merger Consideration represents a premium of
approximately 20.7% over the closing price of our common stock on June 20, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the execution of the original merger agreement that
was signed on June 20, 2018, and a premium of approximately 35.8% over the volume-weighted average closing price of a share of our common stock during the thirty days ended June 20,
2018. We cannot complete the Merger unless all of the conditions to the completion of the Merger, including the approval of the Merger Proposal by holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company common stock on the record date, are satisfied or waived.

        The Company's board of directors (the "Company Board") carefully reviewed and considered the terms and conditions of the proposed Merger. Based on its review, the Company Board
has duly approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The Company Board has (i) determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
Web.com and its stockholders that Web.com enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement,
(ii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote for adoption at the Special Meeting, and (iii) recommended that our stockholders approve the Merger Proposal and thereby
approve the Merger.

        The Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal, "FOR" the Executive Compensation Proposal, and "FOR" the Adjournment
Proposal.

YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. 

        In the materials accompanying this letter, you will find a Notice of Special Meeting of Stockholders, a proxy statement relating to the actions to be taken by our stockholders at the Special
Meeting and a proxy card.

        The proxy statement includes other important information about the Merger Agreement and the Merger. We encourage you to read the entire proxy statement and its annexes carefully. A
copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the attached proxy statement.

        Your vote is very important, regardless of how many shares you own. Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting, please complete, sign, date and return your proxy
card in the enclosed envelope as promptly as possible or submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone as instructed in these materials. It is important that your shares be
represented and voted at the Special Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Special Meeting as you wish, even if you have previously returned your proxy
card or appointed a proxy over the Internet or by telephone. If your shares are held in the name of your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor,
from the holder of record to be able to vote in person at the Special Meeting.

        If your shares of the Company's common stock are held in street name by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will be unable to vote
your shares of the Company's common stock without instructions from you. You should instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee as to how to vote your shares of the Company's
common stock, following the procedures provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee. The failure to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your shares
of the Company's common stock "FOR" approval of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the principal terms of the Merger will have the same effect as voting
against the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the principal terms of the Merger.

        If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares of the Company's common stock, please call our proxy solicitor, Georgeson LLC toll-free at 1-888-613-3524.

        On behalf of the Company Board, I thank you for your support and urge you to vote "FOR" the approval of the Merger Agreement and the principal terms of the Merger.

passed upon the merits or fairness of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, including the proposed Merger or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of
the information contained in the accompanying proxy statement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

To Be Held On October 10, 2018 

Dear Stockholder:

        You are cordially invited to attend the Special Meeting of Stockholders of WEB.COM GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "Web.com"). The meeting will be held
on October 10, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time, at 12808 Gran Bay Parkway West, Jacksonville, Florida 32258 (the "Special Meeting").

The purpose of the Special Meeting is to:

1. Consider and vote on the proposal to adopt the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 5, 2018, by and among Parker Private Holdings II, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company ("Parent"), Parker Private Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Web.com, as it
may be amended from time to time (as so amended, the "Merger Agreement"). A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement accompanying this
notice, which provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Web.com (the "Merger"), with Web.com continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent and approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger (the "Merger Proposal"). Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Siris Capital
Group, LLC, a private equity firm; 

2. Consider and vote, on an advisory basis, upon a proposal to approve the Merger-related compensation for the Company's named executive officers (the "Executive Compensation
Proposal"); 

3. Approve the adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal
at the time of the Special Meeting (the "Adjournment Proposal"); and 

4. Transact such other business as may properly come before the Special Meeting.

        The board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") carefully reviewed and considered the terms and conditions of the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Based
on its review, the Company Board has duly approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, and has (i) determined that it was and is advisable
and in the best interests of Web.com and its stockholders that Web.com enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement, (ii) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote for adoption at the Special Meeting, and (iii) recommended that our stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement and thereby approve the Merger. This item of business to be submitted to a vote of the stockholders at the Special Meeting is more fully described in the attached proxy statement,
which we urge you to read carefully. The Company Board also recommends that you (a) vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the Executive Compensation Proposal, and (b) vote to approve
the Adjournment Proposal. We are not aware of any other business to come before the Special Meeting.

        Stockholders of record at the close of business on August 30, 2018, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the Special
Meeting. All stockholders are cordially invited to attend the Special Meeting in person. Adoption of the Merger Proposal will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Company's common stock at the close of business on the record date.

        Web.com's stockholders will have the right to demand appraisal of their shares of the Company's common stock and obtain payment in cash for the fair value of their shares of the
Company's common stock, but only if they submit a written demand for an appraisal before the vote is taken on the Merger

statement, and a summary of these provisions can be found under "The Merger—Appraisal Rights" in the attached proxy statement.

        You should not send any certificates representing shares of the Company's common stock with your proxy card. Upon completion of the Merger, you will be sent instructions regarding the
procedure to exchange your stock certificates for $28.00 in cash without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, for each share of the Company's common stock that you own.

        THE COMPANY BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE MERGER PROPOSAL, "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION PROPOSAL, AND "FOR" THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL. YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.

        Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, we request that you complete, sign, date and return the
enclosed proxy card, or appoint a proxy over the Internet or by telephone as instructed in these materials, to ensure that your shares will be represented and voted at the Special Meeting if you
are unable to attend. If you sign, date and mail your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Proposal, for
the approval of the Executive Compensation Proposal, and, if necessary, for the approval of the Adjournment Proposal.

        If you fail to return your proxy card or if you fail to appoint a proxy over the Internet or by telephone, your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present at the Special Meeting and will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on the vote to approve the Executive Compensation
Proposal or, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal. If you do attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person, you may withdraw your proxy and vote in person. If your shares are held
in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record to be able to vote in person at the Special Meeting.

        No person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representations other than those set forth in the proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies made
hereby, and, if given or made, such information must not be relied upon as having been authorized by Web.com or any other person.

common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the "Company Common Stock"), at the close of business on August 30, 2018 (the "record date"), will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the
Special Meeting and any continuation, postponement, or adjournment of the Special Meeting. As of the record date, there were approximately 50,220,900 shares of the Company Common

PROPOSALS 

        At the Special Meeting, our stockholders will be asked:

Holdings II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Parent"), Parker Private Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger

Sub with and into Web.com (the "Merger"), with Web.com continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger Proposal"); 

• To consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on an advisory non-binding basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Web.com's named executive officers
in connection with the Merger (the "Executive Compensation Proposal"); and

INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROXY STATEMENT 

        Why you received this proxy statement.    You received these proxy materials because the Company Board is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the Special Meeting. As a
stockholder, you are invited to participate in the Special Meeting and to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement. This proxy statement includes information that we are required
to provide to you under the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and that is designed to assist you in voting your shares.

        Householding.    The SEC's rules permit us to deliver a single set of proxy materials to one address shared by two or more of our stockholders. This delivery method is referred to as
"householding" and can result in significant cost savings. To take advantage of this opportunity, we have delivered only one set of proxy materials to multiple stockholders who share an
address, unless we received contrary instructions from the impacted stockholders prior to the mailing date. We agree to deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the
proxy materials, as requested, to any stockholder at the shared address to which a single copy of those documents was delivered. Alternatively, stockholders sharing an address who are
receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials may request to receive a single copy of such materials in the future. Instructions for making these requests are provided below under
"Questions and Answers about the Special Meeting and Merger."

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address some commonly asked questions you may have regarding the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder of Web.com. Please refer to
the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents incorporated by reference or referred to in this proxy
statement, which you should read carefully and in their entirety.

Q: Why am I receiving these proxy materials? 

A: You are receiving these proxy materials because you own shares of the Company Common Stock. This proxy statement describes matters on which we urge you to vote and is intended
to assist you in deciding how to vote your shares of Common Stock with respect to such matters. On August 5, 2018, Web.com entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and
Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Web.com, with Web.com continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Web.com is holding the Special Meeting to obtain stockholder approval of
the Merger Proposal, the Executive Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. We cannot complete the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement unless the Merger Proposal is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the
close of business on the record date. 

This proxy statement includes important information about the Merger and the Special Meeting. Web.com stockholders should read this information carefully and in its entirety. A copy
of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.

Your vote is very important—we urge you to submit your proxy as soon as possible. Please follow the instructions set forth on the enclosed proxy card (or voting instruction
form provided by the record holder if your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee).

remaining and will be cancelled at the Effective Time and, generally at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than ten business days thereafter),
the holder will receive an amount of cash per share equal to $28.00, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding taxes. 

Q: Will the Merger be taxable to me? 

A: Generally, yes. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally, subject to the more complete summary referenced in the next sentence, you will recognize a taxable gain or loss as a
result of the Merger measured by the difference, if any, between the total amount of cash you receive in the Merger for your shares of the Company Common Stock and your aggregate
adjusted tax basis in those shares. You should read "The Merger—Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 62 for a more complete
summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.

—Reasons for the Recommendation of the Company Board" beginning on page 28.

Table of Contents

Q: What vote of the stockholders is required to adopt the Merger Agreement? 

A: To adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the Merger, stockholders of record as of August 30, 2018, holding a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common
Stock must vote "FOR" the adoption of the Merger Agreement. There are 50,220,900 shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to be voted at the Special Meeting. The failure of
any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote electronically at the Special Meeting will have the
same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal. If you hold your shares in "street name," the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares
of the Company Common Stock will result in a "broker non-vote" of such shares and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal. Abstentions by you or your
bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal. 

Q: What vote is required to approve the Executive Compensation proposal and the Adjournment Proposal? 

A: The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is required to approve the Executive Compensation
Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. The failure of any stockholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or to vote
electronically at the Special Meeting will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in "street name," the failure
to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares will result in a broker non-vote and will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the
Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will not have an effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. 

Q: What is an abstention and how will abstentions be treated? 

A: An "abstention" represents a stockholder's affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. Abstentions are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a
quorum at the Special Meeting. Abstentions by you or your bank, broker or other nominee will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, but will not have an
effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal. 

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights? 

A: Yes. Under Delaware law, you have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of your shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the Merger is completed, but only if
you submit a written demand for an appraisal before the vote on the Merger Agreement, do not vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement and comply with the Delaware law
procedures explained in this proxy statement. Please see the discussion below beginning on page 58 for a detailed discussion. Annex D to this proxy statement contains a copy of the
Delaware statute relating to stockholders' right of appraisal. Failure to follow all of the steps required by this statute will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. We encourage you to
read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. 

Q: What do I need to do now? 

A: We urge you to read this proxy statement carefully, including its annexes, and consider how the Merger affects you. Then mail your completed, dated and signed proxy card in the
enclosed return envelope or appoint a proxy over the Internet or by telephone as soon as possible so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting.

Q: What happens if I do not return a proxy card or otherwise appoint a proxy? 

A: The failure to return your proxy card (or to appoint a proxy over the Internet or by telephone or to vote in person) will have the same effect as voting against adoption of the Merger
Agreement. 

Q: May I vote in person? 

A: Yes. You may vote in person at the Special Meeting, rather than signing and returning your proxy card or appointing a proxy over the Internet or by telephone, if you own shares in your
own name. However, we encourage you to return your signed proxy card, or appoint a proxy over the Internet or by telephone, to ensure that your shares are voted. You may also vote
in person at the Special Meeting if your shares are held in "street name" through a broker or bank provided that you bring a legal proxy from your broker or bank and present it at the
Special Meeting. You may also be asked to present photo identification for admittance. 

Q: May I vote over the Internet or by telephone? 

A: Yes. You may vote by appointing a proxy over the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions included in these materials. 

Q: How many votes do I have? 

A: Holders of record of the Company Common Stock at the close of business on August 30, 2018, are entitled to one vote per share at the Special Meeting on each proposal presented. 

Q: What is a quorum? 

A: A quorum will be present at the Special Meeting if a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock are represented in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting. In
the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, or there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Proposal, we expect that the
Special Meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. 

Q: May I revoke my proxy or change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card or otherwise appointed a proxy? 

A: Yes. You may change your vote at any time before the shares reflected on your proxy card (or with respect to which you have appointed a proxy over the Internet or by telephone) are
voted at the Special Meeting. You can do this in one of four ways. First, you can send a written, dated notice to our corporate secretary stating that you would like to revoke your proxy.
Second, you can complete, sign, date and submit a new proxy card. Third, you can submit a subsequent proxy over the Internet or by telephone. Fourth, you can attend the Special
Meeting and vote in person. Your attendance alone will not revoke your proxy. If you have instructed a broker to vote your shares, you must follow the directions received from your
broker to change your instructions. 

Q: If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me? 

A: Your broker will not vote your shares with respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement without instructions from you. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares,
following the procedure provided by your broker. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted with respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement, which will have the same
effect as voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement. In addition, your broker will not vote your shares with respect to the approval of the Merger-related compensation for
Web.com's named executive officers or, if necessary, to adjourn

or postpone the Special Meeting for the purposes of obtaining additional proxies to vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement.

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now? 

A: No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive written instructions for exchanging your shares of the Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration of $28.00 in cash,
without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, for each share of the Company Common Stock. 

Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed? 

A: We are working toward completing the Merger in the fourth quarter of 2018; however, the Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including Web.com stockholder approval. We
cannot assure you that all conditions to the Merger will be satisfied or, if satisfied, as to the date by which they will be satisfied. 

Q: When will I receive the Merger Consideration for my shares of the Company Common Stock? 

A: After the Merger is completed, you will receive written instructions, including a letter of transmittal, that explain how to exchange your shares for the Merger Consideration payable in
the Merger. When you properly return and complete the required documentation described in the written instructions, you will receive from the paying representative a payment of the
cash consideration for your shares. 

Q: Who can help answer my additional questions? 

A: If you would like additional copies, without charge, of this proxy statement or if you have additional questions about the Merger, including with respect to the procedures for voting
your shares, you should contact us, as follows:

liability company ("Parent"), Parker Private Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Web.com, as it may be amended from

Parent, Merger Sub, and Web.com (the "Original Agreement"), and for a more complete description of the legal terms of the Merger Agreement, you should read carefully this entire
proxy statement and the documents to which we refer. See "Other Matters—Where You Can Find More Information" (page 100) to obtain additional information on Web.com. We have
included page references in parentheses to direct you to a more complete description of the topics presented in this summary. The Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this
proxy statement. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement as it is the legal document that governs the Merger.

        Parent and Merger Sub (page 15).    Parent has not engaged in any business except for activities incidental to its formation and as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and
Merger Sub has been formed specifically for the purpose of participating in the Merger transaction with Web.com. Upon the completion of the Merger, Merger Sub will be merged with
and into the Company, the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Siris Capital
Group, LLC, a private equity firm.

        The Merger (page 22).    Under the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Web.com, and Web.com will be the surviving corporation in the Merger. After the
completion of the Merger, Parent will own all of our outstanding stock. Our stockholders will receive cash in the Merger in exchange for their shares of the Company Common Stock.

        Merger Consideration (page 22).    If the Merger is completed, you will receive $28.00 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the "Merger
Consideration"), in exchange for each share of the Company Common Stock that you own unless you dissent and seek appraisal of the fair value of your shares. After the Merger is
completed, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a Web.com stockholder.

be cancelled in the Merger and the holder will receive an amount of cash per share equal to $28.00, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding taxes; and

level of performance in each performance year remaining, will be cancelled in the Merger and the holder will receive an amount of cash per share equal to $28.00, without any interest

        Market for the Company Common Stock; Dividend Data (page 20).    Our Company Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol
"WEB." On June 20, 2018, the last full trading day prior to the public announcement of the Original Agreement, the Company Common Stock closed at $23.20 per share. On
September 4, 2018, the last full trading day prior to the date of this proxy statement, the Company Common Stock closed at $27.93 per share. Our stock price can fluctuate broadly even
over short periods of time. It is impossible to predict the actual price of our stock immediately prior to the completion of the Merger.

        Reasons for the Merger (page 28).    In the course of reaching its decision to approve the Merger and the Merger Agreement, the Company Board considered possible change of
control transactions involving us, including the Merger described in this proxy statement, and considered a number of other factors in its deliberations. Those factors are described below
in this proxy statement.

        Opinions of the Company's Financial Advisors (page 32).    The Company Board retained Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("BofA Merrill Lynch") and J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC ("J.P. Morgan") as its financial advisors in connection with the potential sale of Web.com. The Company Board elected not to request updated opinions from
BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan when it accepted the higher offer from Parent since the new $28.00 per share cash price to be paid to the holders of the shares of the Company
Common Stock contemplated by the Merger Agreement fell within or above the range of consideration that the financial advisors advised the Company Board would be fair, from a
financial point of view, to the Company's stockholders.

        Opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (page 33).    BofA Merrill Lynch delivered its oral opinion to the Company Board to the effect that, as of
June 20, 2018, and based on and subject to the factors considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken,
the consideration contemplated by the Original Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Company Common Stock. The full text of BofA Merrill Lynch's
written opinion, which is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement, is incorporated herein in its entirety and which you should read carefully and in its entirety, is subject to the
assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other conditions contained in such opinion and is necessarily based on economic, capital markets and other conditions, and the information
made available to BofA Merrill Lynch, as of the date of such opinion.

        The opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch was provided to the Company Board (in its capacity as such) for its information and assistance in connection with its evaluation of the merger
consideration contemplated by the Original Agreement. The opinion and any materials provided in connection therewith did not constitute a recommendation to the Company Board
with respect to the Merger, nor does the opinion constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of the Company Common Stock as to how to vote or act in connection with the
Merger or otherwise. The opinion was provided for the benefit and use of the Company Board in connection with and for the purpose of evaluating, from a financial point of view and as
of the date of such opinion, the merger consideration contemplated by the Original Agreement to be paid to holders of the Company Common Stock, to the extent expressly specified in
such opinion. The opinion does not express any opinion or view as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to the
Company or in which the Company might engage or as to the underlying business decision of the Company to proceed with or effect the Merger, nor does it address any other term,
aspect or implication of the Merger, the Original Agreement (including, without

connection with the Merger or any financing or other transactions related thereto. In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration of
$28.00 per share of the Company Common Stock contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

        For a description of the opinion that the Company Board received from BofA Merrill Lynch, see "The Merger—Opinions of Web.com's Financial Advisors—Opinion of BofA
Merrill Lynch" beginning on page 33.

Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (page 41).

        At the meeting of the Company Board on June 20, 2018, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Company Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors
and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the consideration contemplated in the Original Agreement to be paid to the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the proposed
Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its June 20, 2018 oral opinion by delivering its written opinion to the Company Board,
dated June 20, 2018 that, as of such date, the consideration contemplated in the Original Agreement to be paid to the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the Merger
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.

        The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached
as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of such opinion. The Company's stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan's written opinion was addressed to the Company Board (in
its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the consideration contemplated in the Original Agreement to
be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the
consideration contemplated in the Original Agreement to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by
the Company to engage in the proposed Merger. In addition, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration of $28.00 per share of the Company
Common Stock contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The issuance of J.P. Morgan's opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.

        For a description of the opinion that the Company Board received from J.P. Morgan, see "The Merger—Opinions of Web.com's Financial Advisors—Opinion of J.P. Morgan"
beginning on page 41.

        Recommendations of the Company Board (pages 52, 93, 98 and 99).    The Company Board has unanimously determined that the Merger and the Merger Agreement are fair to,
and in the best interests of, Web.com and its stockholders and declared the Merger and the Merger Agreement to be advisable. The Company Board unanimously recommends that you
vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal. In addition, the Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the Executive Compensation Proposal, and "FOR" the Adjournment
Proposal.

        Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 53).    In considering the recommendation of the Company Board to vote in favor of the Merger
Proposal, you should be aware that the consummation of the Merger will result in certain benefits to our directors and executive officers that are not available to our stockholders
generally, including the following: (a) cash severance payments for our executive officers either at the closing of the Merger or at the time terminated within 12 to 18 months following
the Merger; (b) accelerated vesting of equity awards for our executive officers; (c) accelerated

vesting of restricted stock held by our directors; and (d) continuation of certain indemnification and insurance arrangements.

        Appraisal Rights (page 58).    If you do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration in the Merger, you have the right under Delaware law to have your shares appraised by the
Delaware Chancery Court. This "right of appraisal" is subject to a number of restrictions and technical requirements. Generally, to exercise appraisal rights, among other things, (1) you
must NOT vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (2) you must make a written demand for appraisal in compliance with Delaware law BEFORE the vote on the
adoption of the Merger Agreement, and (3) you must hold shares of the Company Common Stock on the date of making the demand for appraisal and continuously hold such shares
through the completion of the Merger. The fair value of your shares of the Company Common Stock as determined in accordance with Delaware law may be more or less than, or the
same as, the Merger Consideration to be paid to non-dissenting stockholders in the Merger. Merely voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not preserve your right of
appraisal under Delaware law. Annex D to this proxy statement contains a copy of the Delaware statute relating to stockholders' right of appraisal. Failure to follow all of the steps
required by this statute will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. We encourage you to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety.

        Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 62).    The Merger will be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, subject to the
more complete summary referenced in the next sentence, this means that for U.S. federal income tax purposes you will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the
cash you receive in the Merger and your adjusted tax basis in your shares of the Company Common Stock. You should read "The Merger—Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 62 for a more complete summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger. Tax matters can be complicated and
the tax consequences of the Merger to you will depend on the facts of your own situation. You should consult your own tax advisor to understand fully the tax consequences of the
Merger to you.

        Antitrust Matters (page 64).    The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act") prohibits us from completing the Merger until we have furnished
certain information and materials to the United States Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the required waiting
period has expired or been terminated. On July 20, 2018, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, in connection with the Merger.

The Special Meeting (page 16).

        Time, Date and Place.    The Special Meeting will be held (a) to consider and vote upon the Merger Proposal, (b) to consider and vote, on an advisory basis, upon the Executive

Bay Parkway West, Jacksonville, Florida 32258 on October 10, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

        Record Date and Voting Power.    You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of the Company Common Stock at the close of business on August 30, 2018,
the record date for the Special Meeting. You will have one vote at the Special Meeting for each share of the Company Common Stock you owned at the close of business on the record

your shares without instruction from you. Failure to instruct your broker to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote "against" the adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will
have no effect on the other two proposals.

        Required Vote.    The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock at the
close of business on the record date. The approval of the Executive Compensation Proposal, on an advisory basis, requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of the
Company Common Stock present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting. The approval of the Adjournment Proposal, if necessary, requires the
approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company Common Stock present, in person or by proxy, at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. Abstentions
will have the same effect as "against" votes with respect to (1) the Merger Proposal, (2) the Executive Compensation Proposal, and (3) the Adjournment Proposal. Broker non-votes will
have the same effect as "against" votes with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Proposal, and will have no effect with respect to the other two proposals. Broker non-votes are
shares held in "street name" by the beneficial owner of the shares and for which no instruction has been given to the broker on how to vote the shares, and the broker then does not vote
the shares because the broker does not have the discretionary authority to do so.

The Merger Agreement (page 66).

        Go-Shop and No-Shop Provisions.    The Merger Agreement provides that during the "Go-Shop Period" that commenced on the date of the Original Agreement and continued until
11:59 PM (Eastern Time) on August 5, 2018 (the day on which the Go-Shop Period ended, the "No-Shop Period Start Date"), the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers or other employees, controlled affiliates, or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other agent or representative retained by any of them
(collectively, "Representatives") had the right to:

• initiate, solicit and encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, could constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), including by furnishing information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to any person pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement entered into by such person containing confidentiality terms that are no more favorable in the aggregate to such person than those contained in the
confidentiality agreement between the Company and Siris Capital Group, LLC (any such confidentiality agreement, an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement");
provided that the Company was required, to the extent not previously provided to Merger Sub or Parent, provide or make available to Merger Sub or Parent any material
non-public information concerning the Company or its subsidiaries provided or made available to any person prior to or substantially concurrently to providing such
information to such person; and 

• participate in any discussions or negotiations with any persons or group of persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposals or any proposal or offer that constitutes,
could constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and cooperate with or assist or participate in or facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Acquisition Proposals.

        After the date of the Original Agreement, the Company provided a written report to Parent every ten business days containing certain information, including, but not limited to:
(x) a copy of any Acquisition Proposal made in writing since the date of the last written report by the Company and any other written material terms or proposals provided (including
financing commitments) to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (y) the identity of the person or persons making such Acquisition Proposal and (z) a written summary of the material
terms of any Acquisition Proposal not made in writing (including any terms proposed orally or supplementally). During the Go-Shop Period, 87 prospective buyers were contacted

regarding their potential interest in exploring a transaction with the Company. Nine prospective buyers entered into Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements with the Company and were
provided with non-public information relating to the Company. One prospective buyer submitted an Acquisition Proposal to the Company which constituted a Superior Proposal to the
Original Agreement at the time of submission. The Company subsequently negotiated with such prospective buyer, Parent and Merger Sub during the Go-Shop Period to improve their
respective Acquisition Proposals, and during this time Parent and Merger Sub revised the Original Agreement to (among other things) increase the Merger Consideration from $25.00
per share to $28.00 per share (in each case without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) to make the Merger Agreement a Superior Proposal). Following such
negotiations, the Company Board concluded that the prospective buyer's acquisition proposal no longer constituted a Superior Proposal. See "The Merger—Background of the Merger"
beginning on page 22 for a more complete summary.

        The Merger Agreement provides that, except as may relate to any excluded party that submitted an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Proposal prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date (for so long as such Acquisition Proposal is not abandoned or withdrawn and in any event until Company stockholder
approval is obtained for the Merger) or as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, from the No-Shop Period Start Date continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of
the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company and its subsidiaries will not, and the Company will cause its and its subsidiaries' representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:

• solicit, initiate, cause or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal; 

• furnish to any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub) any non-public information relating to the Company or its subsidiaries, or
afford to any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Parent) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or the
intent to encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to constitute an
Acquisition Proposal; 

• participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; 

• amend, modify or grant any waiver or release under, any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement of the Company or any subsidiary, except that the Company may
grant a limited waiver under any "standstill provision" or similar obligation of any third party with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries to allow such third
party to submit an Acquisition Proposal; or 

• enter into any contract contemplating or otherwise relating to an acquisition transaction (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

        Conditions to the Merger.    The obligations of the Parent, Merger Sub and Web.com to complete the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary
conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, the absence of legal prohibitions, the accuracy of representations and warranties of the parties (subject
in some instances to materiality or "material adverse effect" qualifiers), compliance by the parties with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement and the absence of a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in "The Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties" beginning on page 74) since June 30, 2018.

        Termination of the Merger Agreement.    Parent and the Company can terminate the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, including
in certain circumstances if (1) the Merger is not completed on or prior to December 20, 2018, (2) a final, non-appealable order is

Merger, (3) the Company stockholder approval of the Merger is not obtained at the Special Meeting (including any adjournment of postponement thereof), (4) there is a material breach
by a party to the Merger Agreement that is not cured within the applicable time period set forth in the Merger Agreement, (5) there is a change in the Company Board recommendation
in favor of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, (6) there is a willful and material breach by the Company of the no-shop provisions in the Merger Agreement, or (7) the Company
enters into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal prior to the Company stockholder approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement in accordance
with the terms of the Merger Agreement. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page 89 for a more complete summary.

        Expenses.    The Merger Agreement provides that, other than with respect to the termination fees described below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

        Termination Fees.    The Merger Agreement requires us to pay Parent a termination fee of $39.1 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances
described therein, including if (1) there is a change in the Company Board recommendation in favor of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, (2) there is a willful and material breach
by the Company of the no-shop provisions in the Merger Agreement, or (3) in certain circumstances if the Company enters into an alternative acquisition agreement within nine months
after such termination. The Merger Agreement requires Parent to pay us a termination fee of $85.06 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent if Parent and Merger Sub
do not consummate the Merger when required under the Merger Agreement or as a result of Parent or Merger Sub failing to perform or comply with any of its covenants or agreements
in the Merger Agreement in any material respect and such breach is not cured within the time period set forth in the Merger Agreement. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees"
beginning on page 91 for a more complete summary.

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        We are furnishing this proxy statement to you as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Company Board for use at the Special Meeting.

Date, Time and Place

        The Special Meeting will be held at 12808 Gran Bay Parkway West, Jacksonville, Florida 32258, at 10:30 a.m., Eastern Time, on October 10, 2018.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

        You will be asked at the Special Meeting to vote on the Merger Proposal. Based on its review, the Company Board has duly approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated thereby, determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of Web.com and its stockholders that Web.com enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the
Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote for adoption at the Special Meeting, and
recommended that our stockholders adopt the Merger Proposal. You will also be asked to approve, on an advisory basis, the Executive Compensation Proposal and to vote on an Adjournment
Proposal to adjourn or postpone, if necessary, the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting proxies to vote in favor of the Merger Proposal.

Record Date; Stock Entitled to Vote; Quorum

        Only holders of record of the Company Common Stock at the close of business on August 30, 2018, the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting. At the
close of business on the record date, 50,220,900 shares of the Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding and such shares were held by approximately 677 holders of record. A
quorum will be present at the Special Meeting if a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to vote are represented in person or by proxy at the Special
Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, or there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Proposal, we expect that the
Special Meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. Holders of record of the Company Common Stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to one
vote per share at the Special Meeting on each proposal presented.

Vote Required

        The approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock at the close of business on the
record date. If you abstain from voting or do not vote, either in person or by proxy, it will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Broker non-votes will
have the same effect as "against" votes with respect to Merger Proposal.

        The approval, on an advisory basis, of the Executive Compensation Proposal, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company Common Stock
present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. If you abstain from voting, either in person or by proxy, on this matter, it will have the same effect as a vote against
the approval of this matter. Broker non-votes will have no effect with respect to this matter.

        The Adjournment Proposal requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company Common Stock present, in person or by proxy, at the Special Meeting. If you
abstain from voting, either in person or by proxy, on this matter, it will have the same effect as a vote against the approval of this matter. Broker non-votes will have no effect with respect to
this matter.

Voting of Proxies

        All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in the manner specified by the holders. Properly
executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted "FOR" the adoption of the Merger Proposal, "FOR" approval, on an advisory basis, the Executive Compensation
Proposal, and "FOR" approval of the Adjournment Proposal.

        To vote, please complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card or, to vote by appointing a proxy over the Internet or by telephone, follow the instructions provided below. If you
attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person, you may withdraw your proxy and vote in person. If your shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, you must
obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record to be able to vote at the Special Meeting.

        Shares of the Company Common Stock represented at the Special Meeting but not voted, including shares of the Company Common Stock for which proxies have been received but for
which stockholders have abstained, will be treated as present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business.

        Only shares that are affirmatively voted for the approval of the Merger Proposal, including properly executed proxies that do not contain specific voting instructions, will be counted in
favor of that proposal. If you properly execute a proxy card, appoint a proxy over the Internet or by telephone or attend the Special Meeting in person, but abstain from voting on any of the
proposals at the Special Meeting, it will (a) have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, (b) have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Executive Compensation
Proposal, and (c) have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Adjournment Proposal. If you do not properly execute a proxy card, do not appoint a proxy over the Internet or by telephone
and do not attend the Special Meeting in person, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, and will have no effect on each of the Executive Compensation
Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Brokers who hold shares in street name for customers have the authority to vote on "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from
beneficial owners. However, brokers are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to approval of non-routine matters, such as the Merger Proposal and the Executive
Compensation Proposal, and, as a result, absent specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, brokers are not empowered to vote those shares, referred to generally as "broker
non-votes." Broker non-votes, if any, will be treated as shares that are present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists and will have the same effect as
votes "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal, but will have no effect on the Executive Compensation Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal.

        We do not expect that any matter other than the Merger Proposal, the Executive Compensation Proposal, and, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal will be presented at the Special
Meeting. If, however, any other matters are properly presented at the Special Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment as to matters that they believe
to be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Voting over the Internet or by Telephone

        You may also grant a proxy to vote your shares over the Internet or by telephone. The laws of Delaware, under which we are incorporated, specifically permit electronically transmitted
proxies, provided that each such proxy contains or is submitted with information from which the inspector of election can determine that such proxy was authorized by the stockholder.

        The Internet and telephone voting procedures described below are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, to allow stockholders to grant a proxy to vote their shares and to
confirm that stockholders' instructions have been recorded properly. Stockholders granting a proxy to vote over the

Table of Contents

Internet should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies, which must be borne by
the stockholder.

For Shares Registered in Your Name

        Stockholders of record may go to www.proxyvote.com to grant a proxy to vote their shares over the Internet. Have your proxy card in hand when you access the web site and follow the
instructions to obtain your records and to create an electronic voting instruction form. Any stockholder using a touch-tone telephone may also grant a proxy to vote shares by calling 1-800-
690-6903 and following the recorded instructions.

For Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank

        If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee, such as a bank or trust, then such broker or other nominee is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect
to your shares. However, you are still considered to be the beneficial owner of those shares, with your shares being held in "street name." Most beneficial owners whose stock is held in street
name receive instructions for authorizing votes by the broker or other nominee.

        If your shares are held in street name, you may be eligible to vote your shares by telephone or through the Internet. A large number of banks and brokerage firms provide eligible
stockholders the opportunity to vote in this manner. If your bank or brokerage firm allows for this, your voting form provided by your broker or other nominee will provide instructions for
such alternative method of voting.

General Information for All Shares Voted over the Internet or by Telephone

        Votes submitted over the Internet or by telephone must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 9, 2018. Submitting your proxy over the Internet or by telephone will not
affect your right to vote in person should you decide to attend the Special Meeting.

Revocability of Proxies

        The grant of a proxy on the enclosed proxy card or over the Internet or by telephone does not preclude a stockholder from voting in person at the Special Meeting. You may revoke your
proxy at any time before the shares reflected on your proxy card (or with respect to which you have appointed a proxy over the Internet or by telephone) are voted at the Special Meeting by:

• filing with our corporate secretary a properly executed and dated revocation of proxy; 

• submitting a properly completed, executed and dated proxy card to our corporate secretary bearing a later date; 

• submitting a subsequent vote over the Internet or by telephone; or 

• appearing at the Special Meeting and voting in person.

        Your attendance at the Special Meeting will not in and of itself constitute the revocation of a proxy. If you have instructed your broker to vote your shares, you must follow the directions
received from your broker to change these instructions.

Solicitation of Proxies

        All proxy solicitation costs will be borne by us. In addition to solicitation by mail, our directors, officers, employees and agents may solicit proxies from stockholders by telephone or
other electronic means or in person. We also may reimburse brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses in sending these materials to you and getting your voting
instructions. We have also retained

the services of a paid solicitor, Georgeson LLC, to solicit proxies. We anticipate that the cost will be approximately $10,000 plus expenses and will be paid by Web.com.

        You should not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. A letter of transmittal with instructions for the surrender of the Company Common Stock certificates will be mailed to
our stockholders as soon as practicable after completion of the Merger.

Delivery of this Proxy Statement to Multiple Stockholders with the Same Address

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders
sharing the same address, if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family, by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. Each stockholder will
continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," is potentially more convenient for stockholders and more
cost effective for companies since it reduces the volume of duplicate information.

        A number of brokers with account holders who are our stockholders will be "householding" our proxy materials. A single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders
sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they will be "householding"
communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If your household received a single proxy statement, but you
would prefer to receive your own copy, please notify your broker and direct your written request to Web.com Group, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 12808 Gran Bay Parkway West,
Jacksonville, Florida 32258, or contact our Investor Relations Department at 1-904-680-6600. If you would like to receive your own set of our proxy materials in the future, please contact your
broker and Web.com Group, Inc. Investor Relations and inform them of your request. Be sure to include your name, the name of your brokerage firm and your account number. Conversely, if
you and another person sharing your same address are receiving multiple copies of annual reports or proxy statements and you would like to request that you only receive one copy, please
contact your broker and Web.com Group, Inc. Investor Relations and inform them of your request. Be sure to include your name, the name of your brokerage firm and your account number.

Stockholder List

        A list of the Web.com stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available for inspection at our principal executive offices located at 12808 Gran Bay Parkway West,
Jacksonville, Florida 32258, at least 10 days prior to the date of the Special Meeting and continuing through the Special Meeting for any purpose germane to the Special Meeting. The list will
also be available at the Special Meeting for inspection by any stockholder present at the Special Meeting.

THE MERGER 

The Merger

        The discussion under the sections of this proxy statement titled "The Merger" and "The Merger Agreement" summarizes the material terms of the Merger and the Merger Agreement.
Although we believe that the description covers the material terms of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, this summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you. We
urge you to read this proxy statement, the Merger Agreement and the other documents referred to herein carefully for a more complete understanding of the Merger and the Merger Agreement.
The discussion of the Merger in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement and incorporated
by reference into this proxy statement.

Merger Consideration

        Upon consummation of the Merger, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or
Web.com or their respective stockholders, each outstanding share of the Company Common Stock (excluding cancelled shares and Dissenting Shares), will be converted into the right to
receive $28.00 in cash, without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes, which we refer to as the Merger Consideration. From and after the Effective Time, each share of the
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and
each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of the Company Common Stock or book-entry shares will thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such securities other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such certificates and book-entry shares, the Merger Consideration for each share represented thereby. As described
further under the section titled "The Merger Agreement—Payment for the Company Common Stock" of this proxy statement, prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit or cause to be
deposited, with a reputable bank or trust company as payment agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all of the holders of the Company Common Stock
(including the Company Common Stock represented by book-entry shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Dissenting Shares. As promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time (but in no event more than the three business days following the Effective Time), the payment agent will mail to you a letter of transmittal instructing you to send
your certificates or book-entry shares to the paying agent to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of the Company Common Stock represented by such certificates or book-entry
shares.

        After the Merger is consummated, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, you will have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as a
Web.com stockholder as a result of the Merger (except with respect to Dissenting Shares), nor will you be entitled to receive any shares in Parent or the surviving corporation.

Background of the Merger

        The Company Board, also referred to herein as "our board" or the "Company Board", and senior management of the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, over the years, as
part of the Company's strategic planning process, reviewed the Company's near-term and long-term strategy, performance, positioning and operating prospects. As part of this process, the
Company Board also regularly reviewed the competitive landscape of the Company's markets, including consolidation in the industry and the entry of new competitors and new competitive
offerings from existing competitors. These reviews included, from time to time, consideration of potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value, including a sale transaction.

        In February 2015, David Brown, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company Board (whom we refer to as "Mr. Brown") was first contacted by Frank Baker (whom we
refer to as "Mr. Baker"), a Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Siris Capital Group, LLC ("Siris") regarding a

potential transaction, and at the direction of the Company Board, a confidentiality agreement with Siris was executed. Over the course of the next three months, senior management of the
Company, at the direction of the Company Board, participated in several management meetings with Siris. In May 2015, discussions with Siris regarding a potential transaction ended when
valuation could not be agreed upon by the parties. Siris' price range was $21.00 to $22.00 per share. In May 2015, the closing prices for the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market ranged from $21.06 to $23.57 per share.

        In February 2017, in response to in-bound general verbal expressions of interest from strategic and financial investors and after repeated discussions with one of the Company's
stockholders holding approximately eighteen percent (18%) of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, which stockholder had been advocating a sale of the Company (or its
interest in the Company), representatives of the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, authorized BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan, to solicit indications of interest from a
select third party list, including Bidder 1, Bidder 2, and Siris, with respect to a possible acquisition of the Company. BofA Merrill and J.P. Morgan had been selected by the Company based on
their knowledge of the Company through prior engagements relating to capital and debt market transactions and having provided the Company assistance in connection with merger and
acquisition discussions, at varying times during the Company's existence. In connection with the solicitation of interest from Siris, the above-mentioned confidentiality agreement with Siris
was extended, and discussions with Siris regarding a potential transaction were restarted. The Company provided confidential information and held management meetings with eight
(8) potential buyers, all of which were potential financial buyers.

        During the months of April 2017 through June 2017, the Company received preliminary indications of interest to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock
from three private equity firms, Bidder 1, Bidder 2 and Siris. Bidder 1 proposed a per-share price range of $22.00 to $24.00, Bidder 2 proposed a per-share price range of $22.50 to $24.50 and
Siris proposed a per-share price range of $22.00 to $24.00 in April 2017, and $24.00 to $26.00 in June 2017. In June 2017, after deliberation, the Company Board ended the process when it
determined that it was not willing to sell the Company at the valuation proposed by the bidders at that time. During the period of April 2017 through June 2017, the range of closing prices for
Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $17.30 to $25.30 per share.

        On April 4, 2018, Mr. Baker reached out to Mr. Brown to schedule a time to discuss a possible transaction with the Company.

        On April 19, 2018, Mr. Baker and Mr. Brown had a preliminary discussion regarding a possible transaction between Siris and the Company. During the telephone call, valuation and
transaction structure were discussed with Siris proposing to evaluate an acquisition of the Company for $26.00 per share, based on feedback received from Mr. Brown. Subsequent to this call,
Mr. Brown updated Timothy Maudlin, the lead independent director of the Company Board (whom we refer to as "Mr. Maudlin"), on the discussions with Siris in preparation for the Company
Board meeting on April 26, 2018. On April 19, 2018, the closing price for the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $18.65 per share.

        On April 26, 2018, the Company Board held a meeting at which it considered whether to engage with Siris in connection with its non-binding oral proposal to evaluate an acquisition of
the Company for $26.00 per share. Members of the Company's senior management and representatives of Cooley LLP, the Company's counsel ("Cooley"), attended the meeting. After being
presented with the merits and risks attributable to the transaction, including the Company's prior history with Siris, the Company Board directed Mr. Brown to continue discussions with Siris
regarding a potential transaction. On April 26, 2018, the closing price for the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $18.70 per share.

        On May 1, 2018, the Company and Siris entered into an amended confidentiality agreement to extend the term thereof.

        On May 2, 2018, Mr. Brown and Mr. Baker discussed the terms and valuation ($26.00 per share) upon which the Company Board previously agreed it would continue discussions as well

$24.00 per share in connection with a proposed acquisition of the Company, subject to completion of due diligence and definitive documentation. Mr. Brown advised Mr. Baker that the
Company was not willing to transact at $24.00 per share but that Mr. Brown would nevertheless discuss the offer with the Company Board in an upcoming Company Board meeting. On
May 15, 2018, the closing price for the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $18.70 per share.

        On May 17, 2018, Mr. Brown met briefly with Peter Berger, a Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Siris, at the J.P. Morgan Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference,
held in Boston, Massachusetts and briefly discussed the proposed transaction.

        On May 18, 2018, the Company Board held a meeting. Members of the Company's senior management and representatives of Cooley and BofA Merrill Lynch attended the meeting.
Management provided a presentation to the Company Board regarding the Company and BofA Merrill Lynch discussed initial valuation numbers for the Company. Mr. Brown reported that
Siris provided no rationale for lowering the offer price previously discussed to $24.00 per share, and was directed by the Company Board to restate to Siris that the Company would only be
willing to continue discussions if Siris reaffirmed its $26.00 per share proposal. On May 18, 2018, the closing price for Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was
$19.00 per share.

        Mr. Brown conveyed the Company Board's feedback to Mr. Baker and, as a result of this feedback, on May 21, 2018, May 22, 2018, May 23, 2018 and May 24, 2018, Mr. Brown and
Mr. Baker spoke at various times to discuss valuation and Mr. Baker ultimately agreed that Siris would be prepared to pay $25.00 per share and allow for a go-shop period, subject to
completion of due diligence and definitive documentation. Mr. Brown indicated he would discuss Siris' revised proposal with the Company Board. Mr. Brown and Mr. Baker also discussed
Siris' request for the exclusive right to engage in discussions regarding the sale of the Company for a two-week period to finalize its due diligence, obtain financing commitments and negotiate
definitive agreements in connection with the proposed transaction.

        On May 24, 2018, the Company Board met and authorized management to negotiate the grant of exclusivity to Siris based on a $25.00 per share valuation price of the Company Common
Stock. On May 24, 2018, the closing price for the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $18.45 per share.

seven (7) day periods so long as Siris continued to use good faith efforts to progress towards the execution of final definitive agreements relating to the proposed transaction.

        On May 31, 2018, Siris' counsel, Sidley Austin LLP ("Sidley"), provided a draft of the merger agreement to Cooley.

        On June 8, 2018, Cooley sent Sidley a revised draft of the merger agreement as well as an initial draft of the Company's disclosure schedules.

        On June 8, 2018, a representative of Starboard Value LP ("Starboard") called Mr. Brown to inform the Company that funds affiliated with Starboard acquired beneficial ownership of
approximately 9.4% of the Company Common Stock. During the call, Starboard expressed its desire to engage in communications with the Company Board regarding suggestions for
improving the Company's financial and operational performance. In its statement on Schedule 13D, Starboard disclosed its belief that the shares held by Starboard, when purchased, were
undervalued. The Schedule 13D filed by Starboard reflected that Starboard acquired shares of the Company Common Stock during the period between May 2, 2018 through June 7, 2018. On
May 1, 2018, the date of the last closing price prior to the accumulation by Starboard, the closing price for the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $18.75 per
share. On June 7, 2018, the date of the last purchase by Starboard reported in its Schedule 13D, the closing price for the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was

diligence information at the request of Siris, with a view to securing the most favorable terms possible for the Company's stockholders in the merger agreement and the related transaction
documents.

        On June 12, 2018, representatives of Siris, the Company and BofA Merrill Lynch held another in-depth, off-site, in-person, due diligence session.

transaction. The Company Board reviewed and considered conflicts disclosures that had been previously provided to the Company Board by each of BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan, and
resolved to engage each of BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan as the Company's financial advisors with respect to the transaction.

        On June 16, 2018, Mr. Baker and Mr. Brown spoke by telephone to discuss the due diligence and terms of the proposed transaction.

in certain other circumstances, and Siris would be required to pay a reverse termination fee of $78.2 million in the circumstances set forth in the Original Agreement. Representatives of BofA
Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan reviewed with the Company Board a proposed plan to be adopted by the Company Board for the Go-Shop Period as well a list of additional potential buyers to
be contacted during the Go-Shop Period. Also at this meeting, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed with the Company Board its financial analysis of the financial terms of the
proposed transaction and rendered its oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June 20, 2018, to the Company Board to the effect that, as of that date and
based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions and limitations set forth in the written opinion, the $25.00 per share in cash to be paid to the holders of shares of Company's Common Stock
pursuant to the Original Agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. Representatives of J.P. Morgan also reviewed with the Company Board J.P. Morgan's financial
analysis of the financial terms of the proposed transaction and rendered J.P. Morgan's oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of J.P. Morgan's written opinion dated June 20, 2018, to
the Company Board to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions and limitations set forth in J.P. Morgan's written opinion, the $25.00 per share in
cash to be paid to the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. The Company Board also considered the
risks attributable to the Company and its stand-alone business, price and certainty of the proposed transaction.

        Following deliberation of the matters discussed during the course of the meeting, the Company Board unanimously (i) approved and adopted the Original Agreement, the other transaction
documents to which the Company is a party and the execution, delivery and performance of the Original Agreement and the other transaction documents to which the Company is a party,
(ii) recommended to the Company's stockholders that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of the Merger and the Original Agreement, and (iii) directed that such matter be submitted to
the Company's stockholders at a special meeting of the stockholders for approval.

        The limited guarantee was executed and delivered by representatives of the Company and the equity investors. Sidley delivered to Cooley on behalf of Sidley's clients fully executed
copies of the debt commitment letter, the equity commitment letter and limited guarantee on June 20, 2018.

        The Original Agreement was executed by representatives of the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub in the evening of June 20, 2018, and publicly announced the next day.

        On June 21, 2018, following the execution of the Original Agreement and issuance of the press release, pursuant to the "go-shop" provisions of the Original Agreement, at the direction of
the Company Board, BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan commenced the Company's go-shop process. During the Go-Shop Period, 87 prospective buyers (which included the parties still in
existence that had been previously contacted by the Company, BofA Merrill Lynch or J.P. Morgan, including Bidder 1 and Bidder 2, during previous market checks in prior years) were
contacted regarding their potential interest in a transaction with the Company and nine such prospective buyers entered into confidentiality agreements with the Company and were provided
with non-public information relating to the Company. The confidentiality agreements explicitly allow such prospective buyers to submit Acquisition Proposals (as defined in the confidentiality
agreement) to the Company until the Company Stockholder Vote (as defined in the confidentiality agreement), or after the valid termination of the Merger Agreement and the Company enters
into a binding definitive agreement (other than the Merger Agreement) with any third party to effect a purchase, tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination that, if
consummated, would result in a third party owning at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries (taken as a whole). No other standstill provision or similar provision that would prevent a potential bidder from making an offer to the Company Board were outstanding from the
2017 market check described above.

        Over the next several weeks, Mr. Brown and other representatives of the Company held meetings and had discussions with representatives of nine interested parties, including a private
equity firm that ultimately submitted an Acquisition Proposal ("Bidder 3").

        On or around June 25-27, 2018, Bidder 3 reached out to Mr. Baker requesting the opportunity to discuss a potential co-investment with Siris in the recently announced transaction. In light
of the pending go-shop process and Siris' confidentiality agreement with Web.com, Mr. Baker responded that he could not discuss the matter further with Bidder 3.

        On July 25, 2018, the Company Board constituted a Transaction Committee, comprising three independent directors, Timothy P. Cost, Hugh M. Durden, and Philip J. Facchina, to review
any Acquisition Proposals, determine whether any such Acquisition Proposals would constitute a Superior Proposal under the terms of the Original Agreement and negotiate with the parties
relating to a Superior Proposal.

        On August 1, 2018, Bidder 3 provided to the Company an Acquisition Proposal consisting of an offer to pay $26.00 per share plus the $13 million Company termination fee required
under the Original Agreement, and further provided that the Company termination fee would be (i) repayment to Bidder 3 of the $13 million Company termination fee required under the
Original Agreement plus Bidder 3's transaction expenses up to $4 million through August 20, 2018, or (ii) repayment to Bidder 3 of the $13 million Company termination fee required under
the Original Agreement plus an additional $19.55 million after August 20, 2018.

        On August 1, 2018, the Transaction Committee met twice to discuss the Acquisition Proposal from Bidder 3. The Transaction Committee determined that the Bidder 3 Acquisition
Proposal was a Superior Proposal and the Company notified Siris of such proposal. Mr. Brown, representatives of the Company and representatives of Siris met in person later that day to
discuss due diligence matters unrelated to such proposal.

        On August 2, 2018, Siris submitted an Acquisition Proposal of $26.50 per share that expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on August 5, 2018 (the expiration of the Go-Shop Period). This
Acquisition Proposal specified that the higher Company termination fee of $39.1 million (as opposed to the lower Company termination fee of $13 million) would be payable by the Company
if it entered into a Superior Proposal in accordance with the terms of Siris' Acquisition Proposal with any other party after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period (rather than the lower
$13 million Company termination fee that would have been payable by the Company under the Original Agreement if the Company entered into a definitive agreement, within five business
days after the Go-Shop Period with a party that submitted an Acquisition Proposal that constituted or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal prior to the expiration of the
Go-Shop Period). The Transaction Committee reviewed and instructed management to communicate the terms of such Acquisition Proposal to Bidder 3. The Company's financial advisors
conveyed the terms of Siris' Acquisition Proposal (including the expiration thereof and the changes to the Company termination fee thereunder) to Bidder 3 and requested that Bidder 3 submit
its best and final Acquisition Proposal.

        At approximately 6:30 p.m. Eastern time on August 5, 2018, Bidder 3 submitted an Acquisition Proposal of $27.00 per share under which Bidder 3 would pay Parent the $13 million
Company termination fee required under the Original Agreement, and the Company termination fee under such Bidder 3 Acquisition Proposal would be (i) repayment to Bidder 3 of the
$13 million Company termination fee required under the Original Agreement plus an additional $13 million through August 20, 2018, or (ii) repayment to Bidder 3 of the $13 million
Company termination fee required under the Original Agreement plus an additional $39.1 million after August 20, 2018. At approximately 7:30 p.m. Eastern time on August 5, 2018, Siris
submitted a $28.00 per share Acquisition Proposal on substantially similar terms as its prior Acquisition Proposal which also had an expiration time of 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on August 5,
2018. The Company's financial advisors conveyed the terms of Siris' new Acquisition Proposal to Bidder 3 and again requested that Bidder 3 submit its best and final Acquisition Proposal. At
approximately 10:30 p.m. Eastern time on August 5, 2018, Bidder 3 submitted a letter indicating that it was willing to

match the $28.00 per share offer. In comparing the Acquisition Proposals submitted by Siris and Bidder 3, the Company Board was made aware that the Siris proposal included an equity
commitment letter from its affiliated investment funds that committed $55.52 million more equity for the transaction than the equity commitment letter submitted by Bidder 3 (which
commitment represented approximately fifty percent of the uncalled capital commitments of the investment fund associated with Bidder 3) and that Bidder 3 had secured debt commitments for
more than $30 million more than the debt commitments delivered by Siris. Except as described above, the other deal terms were substantially comparable between the Acquisition Proposals
submitted by Siris and Bidder 3. On August 5, 2018, the Company Board held meetings throughout the day and night, at which members of the Company management and representatives of
each of Cooley, BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan were present to consider the various Acquisition Proposals submitted by Siris and Bidder 3. The Company Board reviewed and
considered updated conflicts disclosures that had been provided to the Company Board prior to the meetings by each of BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan prior to considering the
Acquisition Proposals. After consultation with the Company's financial and legal advisors, and a discussion comparing the two Acquisition Proposals, including the level of reliance on equity
and debt financing by the parties, the Company Board, prior to the deadline set by Siris, ultimately determined that Bidder 3's offer was not a Superior Proposal relative to Siris' Acquisition
Proposal of $28.00 per share, taking into account the terms of the proposal, certainty of closing, the economic value to the stockholders and other factors deemed relevant by the Company
Board. The Company Board duly (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are fair, advisable to, and in the best interests of,
the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved the execution, delivery, and performance by the Company of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger, and (iii) recommended that the Company's stockholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

        The Merger Agreement was executed by representatives of the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub at approximately 11:55 p.m. Eastern time on August 5, 2018, and publicly announced
the next day. The Go-Shop Period expired at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on August 5, 2018.

Reasons for the Recommendation of the Company Board

        On August 5, 2018, at a meeting duly called and held, the Company Board (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are
fair, advisable to, and in the best interest of, Web.com and its stockholders, (ii) duly approved the execution, delivery, and performance by Web.com of the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and (iii) recommended that Web.com's stockholders approve the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

        The Company Board consulted with the Company's outside financial and legal advisors and senior management at various times and considered the following factors (which are not listed
in any relative order of importance) in reaching its conclusion to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and to recommend approval
of the adoption of the Merger Agreement to our stockholders, all of which it viewed as generally supporting its decision to approve the business combination with Parent:

        General Business Considerations.    The Company Board considered the Company's background, recent operating history, and current position in the marketplace in its deliberations
concerning the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the following:

• Business and Financial Condition of the Company.  The Company Board considered the Company's business and industry, financial condition, historical and projected financial
performance, competitive position and assets and prospects, as well as current industry, economic and market conditions and trends in the markets in which the Company
competes.

• Management Projections.  The Company Board considered certain forecasts for the Company prepared by the Company's management, and the present value of the Company
based on those projections. The Company Board also considered that the projections were based on various assumptions made by the Company's senior management. The
Company Board considered that there is inherent uncertainty in forecasts and related assumptions and that, as a result, the Company's actual financial results in future periods
could differ materially from management's forecasted results. 

• Financial Presentations of BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan.  The Company Board considered the financial analyses of BofA Merrill Lynch that were performed in
connection with the written opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch, dated June 20, 2018, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions and
limitations set forth in the written opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share to be paid to the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Original Agreement
was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more fully described below under the heading "Opinions of the Company's Financial Advisors—Opinion of BofA
Merrill Lynch." The Company Board also considered the financial analyses of J.P. Morgan that were performed in connection with the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, dated
June 20, 2018, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions and limitations set forth in its opinion, the $25.00 in cash per share to be
paid to the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the Original Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, as more fully described
below under the heading "Opinions of the Company's Financial Advisors—Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC." The Company Board elected not to request updated
opinions from BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan since the new $28.00 in cash per share to be paid to the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock contemplated by
the Merger Agreement fell within or above the range of consideration that the financial advisors advised the Company Board was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
Company's stockholders. 

• Per Share Merger Consideration.  The Company Board considered the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock, including the performance of the
Company Common Stock relative to other participants in the Company's industry, including: 

• Parent's offer consists solely of cash, providing certainty, near-term value and liquidity to our stockholders; 

• the current and historical market price of the Company Common Stock, including the fact that the $28.00 price to be paid for each share represents a premium of
approximately 20.7% over the closing price of $23.20 per share on June 20, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the execution of the Original
Agreement; 

• the fact that the Merger Consideration represents a 35.8% premium over the 30-day volume-weighted average closing price of the Company Common Stock ended
June 20, 2018; 

• the fact that the Merger Consideration represents a 45.2% premium over the 90-day volume-weighted average closing price of the Company Common Stock ended
June 20, 2018; 

• the fact that the Company provided for a 45-day go-shop provision in the Original Agreement to ensure that the Company could solicit a Superior Proposal (as defined
in the section titled "The Merger Agreement—Solicitation of Other Offers" beginning on page 80); and 

• the Company Board's consideration of the risks related to (i) the Company's ability to sustain its revenue growth rate, (ii) the economic and other risks impacting
spending by small businesses for subscription-based solutions for domains, hosting, website design and management, search engine optimization, online marketing
campaigns, local sales leads, social media, mobile products and e-Commerce solutions, and (iii) its current and future competitive position in its industry.

• Strategic Alternatives.  In recent years, the Company has explored various strategic alternatives, involving both strategic and financial buyers, including the sale of the
Company's entire business. No other sale efforts resulted in an agreement.

        Positive Deal Considerations.    The Company Board considered a number of positive factors in its deliberations concerning the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the following:

• Likelihood of Completion; Certainty of Payment.  Absent a Superior Proposal, the Merger represented a transaction that would likely be consummated based on, among other
factors: 

• the absence of any financing condition to the consummation of the Merger; 

• the reputation and financial condition of Siris and its affiliated investment funds and their proven ability to complete acquisition transactions; and 

• the Company's ability to request that the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court located
in the County of New Castle, Delaware) specifically enforce the Merger Agreement, including the consummation of the Merger, under certain circumstances described
in "The Merger Agreement—Specific Performance." 

• Certainty of Consideration.  The Company Board considered the all-cash nature of the consideration to be paid in the Merger, which allows Company stockholders to realize
immediate value, in cash, for their investment in the Company, while enabling stockholders to avoid further risk of investment in the Company. 

• Other Positive Terms of the Merger Agreement.  The Company Board considered the terms of the Merger Agreement, which are more fully described below under the heading
"The Merger Agreement." Certain provisions of the Merger Agreement that the Company Board considered significant include: 

• the scope of the representations, warranties and covenants being made by Parent and Merger Sub; 

• the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, including the requirement that the Merger Agreement be approved by the Company's stockholders; 

• the fact that the Company solicited alternative Acquisition Proposals during a 45-day Go-Shop Period after the signing of the Merger Agreement, subject to paying a
reduced termination fee to Parent equal to $13,000,000 during the Go-Shop Period, and the ability to accept Superior Proposals made thereafter, at a termination fee of
$39,100,000 (the "Company Termination Fee"); 

• the Company Board's belief that, if triggered, the Company Termination Fee payable to Parent is consistent with fees payable in comparable transactions and would not
be likely to preclude another party from making a competing proposal; 

• Parent's obligation to pay the Company a termination fee, equal to $85,060,000 ("Parent Termination Fee"), if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain
circumstances based upon Parent and Merger Sub's (i) breach of the Merger Agreement that would give rise to any failure of certain closing conditions therein, where
such breach is incurable prior to the Outside Date, or if curable, is not cured by the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days after notice of the Outside Date or (ii) failure to
consummate the Merger for any reason after the satisfaction of all closing conditions; 

• the fact that the Merger Agreement provides for specific performance in certain conditions as an alternative remedy available to the Company other than the Parent
Termination Fee; and 

• the following additional "deal protection" terms of the Merger and Merger Agreement: 

• the lack of a financing contingency to Parent's obligations to close the Merger;

• the requirement that Parent secure and deliver executed documents evidencing the ability to finance the Merger contemporaneous with the signing of the Merger
Agreement; 

• the guarantee by affiliates of Parent of certain of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under the Merger Agreement, including payment of the Parent
Termination Fee; 

• certain items, subject to certain conditions, will not be considered a Company Material Adverse Effect, including (i) changes in financial, banking or securities
markets, (ii) conditions or changes in the Company's industry, (iii) general political or economic conditions, (iv) changes in customers, supplier, or other
Company relationships arising from the announcement or pendency of the Merger, (v) litigation arising from the announcement or pendency of the Merger,
(vi) the failure of the Company to achieve its projections, and (vii) changes in laws or accounting principles; and 

• the holders of Dissenting Shares will be entitled to the payment of the appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares if demand is made and pursued in accordance
with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

        Other Deal Considerations.    The Company Board also considered a number of uncertainties, risks and potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the following:

• No Participation in the Company's Future.  The Company Board considered that if the Merger is consummated, Company stockholders will receive the per share Merger
Consideration in cash and will no longer have the opportunity to participate in any future earnings or growth of the Company or benefit from any potential future appreciation in
the value of Company shares, including any value that could be achieved if the Company engages in future strategic or other transactions. Moreover, upon the closing of the
Merger, Company stockholders not voting in favor of the Merger will be required to surrender their shares (other than the Dissenting Shares) in exchange for a price determined
by the Company Board and approved by a majority of the Company stockholders. 

• No-Shop Period.  The Company Board considered that, following the Go-Shop Period, the Company cannot solicit other Acquisition Proposals after the Go-Shop Period, and
must pay Parent $39,100,000 if, thereafter, the Company exercises its right to enter into a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal subject to the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement, which may deter others from proposing an alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to the Company's stockholders. 

• Risks the Merger May Not Be Completed.  The Company Board considered the risk that the conditions to the Merger may not be satisfied and that, therefore, the Merger would
not be consummated. The Company Board also considered the risks and costs to the Company if the Merger is not consummated, including: 

• the possible effects of the pendency (or termination) of the Merger Agreement on the Company's business, operating results, prospects, management, employees,
customers, distributors and suppliers, including diversion from day to day operations, which effects are likely to be exacerbated the longer the time period between the
signing and any termination of the Merger Agreement; 

• the potential effect on the trading price of the Company Common Stock; 

• if Parent fails to complete the Merger as a result of a breach of the Merger Agreement, depending upon the reason for not closing, remedies may be limited to the Parent
Termination Fee payable by Parent, which may be inadequate to compensate the Company for the damage caused (and such Parent Termination Fee is itself limited in
certain situations), and if available, other rights and remedies may be expensive and difficult to enforce, and the success of any such action may be uncertain; and 

• the fact that the Company is subject to various remedies available to Parent should the Company fail to complete the Merger or breach the Merger Agreement.

• Interim Operating Covenants.  The Company Board considered that the Merger Agreement imposes restrictions on the conduct of the Company's business prior to the
consummation of the Merger, requiring the Company and its subsidiaries to conduct their business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business and to use
commercially reasonable best efforts to preserve their business organizations substantially intact, customers and suppliers having significant business dealings with them and
keep available the services of their key employees, and that may limit the Company and its subsidiaries from taking specified actions, which may delay or prevent the Company
from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the Merger.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Company Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the Company
Board. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger, the Company Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign
relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The
Company Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate determination.
The Company Board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented.

        In considering the recommendation of the Company Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have
interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours. The Company Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the
Merger Agreement and the Merger, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the Company. See "The Merger—Interests of our Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger."

        Portions of this explanation of the reasons for the Merger and other information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the section
titled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

        The Company Board concluded that the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the
Merger to the holders of the Company Common Stock.

        The foregoing discussion of the Company Board's reasons for its recommendation to approve the Merger is not meant to be exhaustive, but addresses the material information and factors
considered by the Company Board in consideration of its recommendation. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Company Board in connection with its evaluation of the
Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Company Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in
reaching its determination and recommendation. Rather, the directors made their determinations and recommendations based on the totality of the information presented to them, and the
judgments of individual members of the Company Board may have been influenced to a greater or lesser degree by different factors. In arriving at their respective recommendations, the
members of the Company Board were aware of the interests of executive officers and directors of Web.com as described under "The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger."

The Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote
"FOR" the approval of the Merger Proposal.

and use of the Company Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the consideration contemplated by the Original Agreement from a
financial point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger
in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage or as to the underlying business decision of the
Company to proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the proposed Merger or any other matter.

        In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch, among other things:

(i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company; 

(ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of the Company furnished to or discussed with BofA Merrill
Lynch by the management of the Company, including certain financial forecasts relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company, referred to herein as
Company management forecasts; 

(iii) reviewed the estimated net operating loss tax attributes of the Company prepared by the management of the Company, referred to herein as the NOLs; 

(iv) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company with members of senior management of the Company; 

(v) reviewed the trading history for the Company Common Stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading histories of other companies BofA Merrill Lynch
deemed relevant; 

(vi) compared certain financial and stock market information of the Company with similar information of other companies BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant; 

(vii) compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant; 

(viii) considered the results of BofA Merrill Lynch's prior efforts in 2017 on behalf of the Company to solicit, at the direction of the Company, indications of interest and definitive
proposals from third parties with respect to a possible acquisition of the Company; 

(ix) reviewed the Original Agreement; and 

(x) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Merrill Lynch deemed appropriate.

        In arriving at its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and data
publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with it and relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company that it was not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Company management forecasts and the NOLs, BofA Merrill
Lynch was advised by the Company, and assumed, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of
the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company and the other matters covered thereby. BofA Merrill Lynch relied, at the Company's direction, upon the assessments of the
management of the Company as to the potential impact of market, governmental and regulatory trends and developments relating to or affecting the Company and its business. BofA Merrill
Lynch also relied, at the Company's direction, on the assessments of the Company management as to the ability to utilize the NOLs and was advised by the Company, and assumed at the
Company's direction, that such NOLs would be utilized in the amounts and at the times projected. BofA Merrill Lynch did not make

under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, at the direction of the Company, that the Merger would be
consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary
governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or
amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits of the Merger.

        BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Merger (other than the then - applicable $25.00 per share merger consideration to
the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any related transactions or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding
entered into in connection with or related to the Merger or otherwise. BofA Merrill Lynch was not requested to solicit (except as summarized in "Background of the Merger" above and in the
following sentence), and since 2017 did not solicit, indications of interest or proposals from third parties regarding a possible acquisition of all or any part of the Company or any alternative
transaction. However, the Original Agreement permitted the Company to authorize BofA Merrill Lynch, during a specified period of time following the execution of the Original Agreement,
to solicit on the Company's behalf indications of interest or proposals from third parties with respect to the possible acquisition of all or any part of the Company. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion
was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration contemplated by the Original Agreement to be received by the holders of the Company Common Stock and no
view or opinion was expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party.
In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors
or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the then - applicable $25.00 per share merger consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was
expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage or as to the
underlying business decision of the Company to proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Merrill Lynch also did not express any view or opinion with respect to, and BofA Merrill Lynch
relied, at the direction of the Company, upon the assessments of representatives of the Company regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to the Company or the
Merger, as to which matters BofA Merrill Lynch understood that the Company obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch
expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other matter.

        BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available
to BofA Merrill Lynch as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect its opinion, and BofA Merrill Lynch does not have any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Merrill Lynch. Except as described in this
summary, the Company imposed no other limitations on the investigations made or procedures followed by BofA Merrill Lynch in rendering its opinion.

        The discussion set forth below in the section titled "Company Financial Analyses" represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to the

Merrill Lynch, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by
BofA Merrill Lynch. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch.

Company Financial Analyses

        Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis.    BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information for the Company and the following four publicly
traded companies in the internet services and online marketing solutions sector, two of which it classified as "core" companies (selected publicly traded companies with projected revenue
growth of less than 10% in 2018 and 2019):

• United Internet AG (core) 

• Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. (core) 

• GoDaddy Inc. (other) 

• Wix.com Ltd. (other)

        BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, among other things, enterprise values of the selected publicly traded companies, calculated as the sum of the market capitalization, total debt, preferred
stock and minority interest, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, as a multiple of calendar year 2018 and calendar year 2019 estimated earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and one-time, non-recurring items. For the two
core companies, the observed multiples were 10.6x and 10.4x for calendar year 2018 and 9.8x and 9.8x for calendar year 2019. For one of the other companies, the observed multiples were
28.4x and 23.2x for calendar year 2018 and calendar year 2019, respectively. For the remaining other company, the observed multiples were designated "not meaningful," for each of calendar
year 2018 and calendar year 2019. BofA Merrill Lynch also observed the multiples derived from the Company management forecasts and certain publicly available financial forecasts with
respect to the Company, referred to herein as the Company public forecasts, as of May 1, 2018 (the date of the last closing price prior to the accumulation by Starboard Value LP ("Starboard"),
a holder of Company Common Stock (the "Pre-Starboard Accumulation Date")) and June 8, 2018 (the date on which Starboard filed a Form 13-D with the SEC indicating its ownership of the
Company Common Stock (the "Starboard 13-D Date")), ranging from 8.1x to 9.3x for calendar year 2018 and from 7.4x to 9.0x for calendar year 2019. BofA Merrill Lynch then applied
multiples of 9.0x to 10.5x and 8.5x to 10.0x, respectively to the Company's calendar year 2018 and 2019 estimated adjusted EBITDA. In applying the calendar year 2018 and 2019 multiples,
BofA Merrill Lynch took into consideration, among other things, the observed data for the selected publicly traded companies and for the Company, the historical trading prices of the
Company Common Stock and the common stocks of the selected publicly traded companies and the differences in the financial profiles of the Company and the selected publicly traded
companies, including that the Company had an enterprise value / estimated next twelve months ("NTM") adjusted EBITDA multiple that (i) was 0.8x and 0.7x lower than the multiple for the
"core" selected publicly traded companies as of the Pre-Starboard Accumulation Date and the Starboard 13-D Date, respectively, (ii) for the period ended the Starboard 13-D Date, was 1.4x
lower than the one month, six month, one year and three year average multiples for the "core" selected publicly traded companies and (iii) for the period ended the Starboard 13-D Date, was
1.3x lower than the five year average multiple for the "core" selected publicly traded companies. BofA Merrill Lynch also reviewed enterprise values of the selected publicly traded companies
as a multiple of unlevered free cash flow based on adjusted EBITDA, less capital expenditures. For the two core companies, the observed multiples were 13.1x and 12.4x for calendar year
2018 and 12.9x and 11.6x for calendar year 2019. For the other companies, the observed multiples were designated "not

meaningful," other than a multiple of 27.0x for one of such companies for calendar year 2019. The observed multiples derived from the Company management forecasts and the Company
public forecasts as of the Pre-Starboard Accumulation Date and the Starboard 13-D Date ranged from 8.9x to 10.4x for calendar year 2018 and 8.2x to 10.0x for calendar year 2019. BofA
Merrill Lynch then applied multiples of 10.0x to 12.5x and 9.5x to 12.0x, respectively, to the Company's calendar year 2018 and 2019 estimated unlevered free cash flow. In applying the
calendar year 2018 and 2019 multiples, BofA Merrill Lynch took into consideration, among other things, the observed data for the selected publicly traded companies and for the Company, the
historical trading prices of the Company Common Stock and the common stocks of the selected publicly traded companies and the differences in the financial profiles of the Company and the
selected publicly traded companies, including that the Company had an enterprise value / estimated NTM unlevered free cash flow multiple that (i) was 1.9x lower than the multiple for the
"core" selected publicly traded companies as of both the Pre-Starboard Accumulation Date and the Starboard 13-D Date and (ii) for the period ended the Starboard 13-D Date, was 2.7x, 2.5x,
2.4x, 2.3x and 2.7x lower than the one month, six month, one year, three year and five year average multiples, respectively, for the "core" selected publicly traded companies. BofA Merrill
Lynch also reviewed equity values of the selected publicly traded companies as a multiple of free cash flow based on cash flow from operations, less cash expenditures. For the two core
companies, the observed multiples were 19.8x and 10.8x for calendar year 2018 and 17.4x and 9.0x for calendar year 2019. For the other companies, the observed multiples were designated
"not meaningful" for one company, and 23.5x for calendar year 2018 and 20.8x for calendar year 2019 for the other company. The observed multiples derived from the Company management
forecasts and the Company public forecasts as of the Pre-Starboard Accumulation Date and the Starboard 13-D Date ranged from 7.6x to 8.9x for calendar year 2018 and 6.0x to 8.5x for
calendar year 2019. BofA Merrill Lynch then applied multiples of 10.0x to 16.0x and 7.5x to 13.5x, respectively, to the Company's calendar year 2018 and 2019 free cash flow. In applying the
calendar year 2018 and 2019 multiples, BofA Merrill Lynch took into consideration, among other things, the observed data for the selected publicly traded companies and for the Company, the
historical trading prices of the Company Common Stock and the common stocks of the selected publicly traded companies and the differences in the financial profiles of the Company and the
selected publicly traded companies, including that the Company had an equity value / estimated NTM free cash flow multiple that (i) was 4.1x and 4.8x lower than the multiple for the "core"
selected publicly traded companies as of the Pre-Starboard Accumulation Date and the Starboard 13-D Date, respectively and (ii) for the period ended the Starboard 13-D Date, was 6.3x, 4.8x,
5.2x, 4.8x and 5.1x lower than the one month, six month, one year, three year and five year average multiples, respectively, for the "core" selected publicly traded companies. Estimated
financial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts' estimates, and estimated financial data of the Company were based on the Company
management forecasts. These analyses indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for the Company, as compared to the then - applicable $25.00 per
share merger consideration (rounded to the nearest $0.05 per share):

        No company used in these analyses are identical or directly comparable to the Company. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this
analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics

        Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis.    BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to the following twenty selected transactions
involving companies in the internet services and online marketing solutions sector:

        BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed transaction values, based on the consideration payable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target company's last twelve months' EBITDA. The
observed multiples ranged from 5.9x to 16.4x (with an average (excluding Web.com/Yodle) of 11.0x and a median (excluding Web.com/Yodle) of 11.1x). BofA Merrill Lynch then applied last
twelve months' EBITDA multiples of 9.0x to 12.0x, derived from the selected transactions and based on BofA Merrill Lynch's professional judgment and experience, to the Company's last
twelve months' EBITDA, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and one-time, non-recurring items. Estimated financial data of the selected transactions were based on
publicly available information. Estimated financial data of the Company were based on the Company management forecasts. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per
share equity value reference ranges for the Company, as compared to the then-applicable $25.00 per share merger consideration (rounded to the nearest $0.05 per share):

        No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to the Company or the Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not
entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect
the acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which the Company and the Merger were compared.

        Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company to calculate the estimated present value of the standalone unlevered,
after-tax free cash flows (which unlevered free cash flows were calculated based on the tax-effected adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization plus depreciation less capital
expenditures, other cash flow and change in net working capital, in each case as set forth in the Company Forecasts (see, as defined in "The Merger—Certain Company Forecasts") and the
filings made by the Company with the SEC) that the Company was forecasted to generate from the second fiscal quarter of 2018 through fiscal year 2022, together with the estimated cash flow
benefit that the Company was forecasted to realize from certain NOLs from the second fiscal quarter of 2018 through fiscal year 2023, in each case based as set forth in the Company Forecasts
(see, as defined in "The Merger—Certain Company Forecasts") and the filings made by the Company with the SEC). BofA Merrill Lynch calculated implied terminal values for the Company
based on perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.0%, which range was selected based on BofA Merrill Lynch's professional judgment and experience. The cash flows and terminal
values were then discounted to present value as of March 31, 2018, which present values ranged from approximately $495 million to $514 million in the case of cash flows, and approximately
$1.187 billion to $1.736 billion in the case of terminal values, in each case using discount rates ranging from 9.25% to 11.00%, which were based on an estimate of the Company's weighted
average cost of capital derived using the capital asset pricing model. These estimates assumed fully diluted shares calculated based on 49.779 million basic shares outstanding, 0.611 million
shares of restricted and performance stock units and 5.245 million outstanding options with a weighted average exercise price of $17.58 per share, converted using the Treasury Stock Method),
and net debt of $632 million ($17 million of cash and cash equivalents and $649 million of debt). This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference
range for the Company as compared to the then - applicable merger consideration (rounded to the nearest $0.05 per share):

Other Factors

        BofA Merrill Lynch also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Merrill Lynch's material financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced
for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:

• historical trading prices of the Company Common Stock during the 52-week period ended the Starboard 13-D Date, which ranged between $17.35 and $25.95 per share; 

• publicly available research analysts' price targets for the Company Common Stock, which generally indicated low to high price targets for the Company Common Stock of
approximately $18.00 to $28.00 per share, with one analyst setting a target price of $32.00 based on such analyst's view of the potential ability to improve operations or sell the
business; and

Miscellaneous

        As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the section titled "Company Financial Analyses" is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to the
Company Board in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or factors considered by BofA Merrill Lynch in connection with its opinion.
The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application
of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Merrill Lynch believes that its
analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Merrill Lynch further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information
presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying
BofA Merrill Lynch's analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight
than any other analysis referred to in the summary.

        In performing its analyses, BofA Merrill Lynch considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of
the Company. The estimates of the future performance of the Company in or underlying BofA Merrill Lynch's analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Merrill Lynch's analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Merrill
Lynch's analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the then—applicable merger consideration to be received by such holders and
were provided to the Company Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company
might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from,
any particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Merrill Lynch's view of the actual values of the Company.

        The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between the Company and Parent, rather than by any financial advisor, and was
approved by the Company Board. The decisions to enter into the Original Agreement and the Merger Agreement were solely that of the Company Board. As described above, BofA Merrill
Lynch's opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Company Board in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the
views of the Company Board or management with respect to the Merger or the $25.00 per share merger consideration as of June 20, 2018.

        BofA Merrill Lynch received a fee from the Company of $1.5 million for the delivery of its opinion. The Company has agreed to pay BofA Merrill Lynch a transaction fee of
approximately $17.04 million, against which the opinion fee will be credited, upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company also has agreed to reimburse BofA Merrill Lynch for its
expenses incurred in connection with BofA Merrill Lynch's engagement and to indemnify BofA Merrill Lynch, any controlling person of BofA Merrill Lynch and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.

        At the meeting of the Company Board on June 20, 2018, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the Company Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth in its opinion, the consideration contemplated by the Original Agreement to be paid to the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. J.P. Morgan has confirmed its June 20, 2018 oral opinion by delivering its written

opinion to the Company Board, dated June 20, 2018 that, as of such date, the consideration contemplated by the Original Agreement to be paid to the holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders.

        The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan dated as of June 20, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is attached as
Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the full text of such opinion. The Company's stockholders are urged to read the opinion in its entirety. J.P. Morgan's written opinion was addressed to the Company Board (in its capacity as
such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the consideration contemplated by the Original Agreement to be paid to the holders
of the Company Common Stock in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger. In addition, J. P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration
of $28.00 per share of the Company Common Stock contemplated by the Merger Agreement. J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the consideration contemplated by the
Original Agreement to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the proposed
Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan's opinion was approved by a fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as
to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter.

        In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan, among other things:

• reviewed the Original Agreement; 

• reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates; 

• compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and
the consideration paid for such companies; 

• compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other companies J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and
reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies; 

• reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business; and 

• performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the purposes of its opinion.

        In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to certain aspects of the Merger, and the past and current business
operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its inquiry.

        In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan
by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its engagement
letter with the Company, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or
appraisal of any assets or liabilities, nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of the Company or Parent under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In
relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or

derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the
expected future results of operations and financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the
assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Original Agreement will be consummated as described in the
Original Agreement. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub in the Original Agreement and the related agreements
were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with
respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained
without any adverse effect on the Company or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.

        J.P. Morgan's opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion.
J.P. Morgan's opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan's opinion, and that J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P.
Morgan's opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration contemplated by the Original Agreement to be paid to the holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan has expressed no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid in connection with the Merger to the holders of any other
class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion
with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the consideration
contemplated by the Original Agreement to be paid to the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan
expressed no opinion as to the price at which the Company Common Stock will trade at any future time.

        The terms of the Original Agreement and the Merger Agreement were determined through arm's length negotiations between the Company and Parent, and the decisions to enter into the
Original Agreement and the Merger Agreement were solely that of the Company Board. J.P. Morgan's opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the
Company Board in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Company Board or management with respect to the proposed Merger or
the consideration.

        In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodology in rendering its opinion to the Company Board on June 20,
2018 and contained in the presentation delivered to the Company Board on such date in connection with the rendering of such opinion and does not purport to be a complete description of the
analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and to
more fully understand the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below without considering
the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan's
analyses.

        J.P. Morgan calculated and compared various financial multiples and ratios based on public filings with the SEC, equity analyst research reports, FactSet market prices and other publicly
available information as of June 19, 2018 for each of the selected companies listed above and as of June 8, 2018 for the Company, the last trading day prior to the filing by Starboard Value LP
of a Schedule 13D reporting a 9.4% ownership interest in the Company Common Stock, and in all instances multiples were based on the closing share prices on June 19, 2018 for each of the
selected companies listed above and on June 8, 2018 for the Company.

        Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the ratio of such company's firm value to the equity research analyst consensus estimate for such
company's Adjusted EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-based compensation), for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018
(the "FV/2018E Adjusted EBITDA") and the ratio of such company's firm value to the equity research analyst consensus estimate for the company's estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2019 (the "FV/2019E Adjusted EBITDA"). In addition, with respect to the Company, J.P. Morgan also calculated and compared the FV/2018E Adjusted EBITDA
and FV/2019E Adjusted EBITDA based on equity research analyst consensus estimates for the Company. The following table represents the results of this analysis for each of the selected
companies:

        Based on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its experience and professional judgment, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple
reference range of 9.0x - 10.5x for FV/2018E Adjusted EBITDA and a multiple reference range of 8.5x - 10.0x for FV/2019E Adjusted EBITDA.

        After applying these ranges to the Company's estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 based on the Company projections (as
defined in the section titled "The Merger—Certain Company Forecasts" beginning on page 49), the analysis indicated the following ranges of implied equity value per share for the Company
Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25:

        The ranges of implied equity value per share were compared to (a) the unaffected closing price per share of the Company Common Stock of $21.05 as of June 8, 2018, and (b) the then -
proposed cash consideration of $25.00 per share of the Company Common Stock.

        In addition, using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the ratio of such company's firm value to the equity research analyst consensus
estimate for such company's unlevered free cash flow ("uFCF") for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the "FV/2018E uFCF") and the ratio of such company's firm value to the equity
research analyst consensus estimate for such company's uFCF for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (the "FV/2019E uFCF"). uFCF is defined as Adjusted EBITDA (before stock based
compensation) less capital expenditures. In addition, with respect to the Company, J.P. Morgan also calculated and compared the FV/2018E uFCF and FV/2019E uFCF based on equity
research analyst consensus estimates for the Company. The following table represents the results of this analysis:

        Based on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its experience and professional judgment, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple
reference range of 10.0x - 12.5x for FV/2018E uFCF and a multiple reference range of 10.0x - 12.0x for FV/2019E uFCF.

        After applying these ranges to the Company's estimated uFCF for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, based on the Company projections (as defined in the
section titled "The Merger—Certain Company Forecasts" beginning on page 49), the analysis indicated the following ranges of implied equity value per share ranges for the Company
Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25:

        The ranges of implied equity value per share were compared to (a) the unaffected closing price per share of the Company Common Stock of $21.05 as of June 8, 2018 and (b) the then -
proposed cash consideration of $25.00 per share of the Company Common Stock.

        Finally, using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected company, the ratio of such company's equity value to the equity research analyst consensus estimate
for such company's levered free cash flow ("LFCF") for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the "EV/2018E LFCF") and the ratio of such company's equity value as of June 19, 2018 to
the equity research analyst consensus estimate for such company's LFCF for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (the "EV/2019E LFCF"). LFCF is defined as cash flow from operating
activities, less capital expenditures. Equity value is defined as the product of a company's share price and the fully diluted number of outstanding shares of such company. In addition, with

        After applying these ranges to the Company's estimated LFCF for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 based on the Company projections (as defined in the
section titled "The Merger—Certain Company Forecasts" beginning on page 49), the analysis indicated the following ranges of implied equity value per share ranges for the Company

Selected Transaction Analysis

        Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan reviewed selected transactions involving businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan's analysis and based on its experience and
professional judgment, were considered similar to the Company's business. Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the transactions set forth in the below table involving companies in the domain
name registration and web hosting services industry.

        Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the ratio of the target company's firm value implied by the consideration paid in such

announcement of the applicable transaction ("FV/LTM Adjusted EBITDA"). The following table represents the results of this analysis for each of the selected transactions:

        Based on the results of this analysis and other factors which J.P. Morgan considered appropriate based on its experience and professional judgment, J.P. Morgan selected a multiple
reference range of 10.0x - 13.0x for FV/LTM Adjusted EBITDA and applied it to the Company's Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018. This analysis indicated a
range of implied equity values per share of the Company Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $24.25 - $34.50, which was compared to (a) the unaffected closing price per share of
the Company Common Stock of $21.05 as of June 8, 2018 and (b) the then - proposed cash consideration of $25.00 per share of the Company Common Stock.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.

        J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity value per share for the Company Common Stock. A discounted cash
flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset and taking into consideration the time value of money with
respect to those future cash flows by calculating their "present value." The "unlevered free cash flows," for purposes of the discounted cash flow analysis, refers to a calculation of the future
cash flows generated by an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. "Present value" refers to the current value of the future cash flows generated by the asset, and is
obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and estimates of risk, the cost of capital and other
appropriate factors. "Terminal value" refers to the present value of all future cash flows generated by the asset for periods beyond the projections period.

        J.P. Morgan calculated the present value of the future standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that the Company was forecasted to generate from the second fiscal quarter of 2018
through fiscal year 2022 based upon the Company projections. J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values for the Company at the end of the five-year period ended 2022 by
applying a terminal growth rate ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% (which range was developed with, and reviewed and approved by, the management of the Company) to the unlevered free cash
flows of the Company during the final year of the projections. The unlevered free cash flows and the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values as of March 31, 2018
using a range of discount rates from 8.75% to 10.75%. The discount rate range was selected by J.P. Morgan based on J.P. Morgan's analysis of the weighted average cost of capital for the
Company derived using the capital asset pricing model. The present values were then adjusted to take into account the present value of certain of the Company's tax attributes as well as the
Company's net debt of

$649 million ($10 million of cash and cash equivalents and $659 million of debt) as of March 31, 2018 to derive implied equity values for the Company. The implied equity values per share
assumed fully diluted shares calculated based on 49.779 million basic shares outstanding, 0.611 million shares of restricted and performance stock units and 5.245 million outstanding options
(with a weighted average exercise price of $17.58, converted using the Treasury Stock Method).

        Based on the foregoing, this analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of the Company Common Stock, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of $19.25 - $31.75, which was
compared to (a) the unaffected closing price per share of the Company Common Stock of $21.05 as of June 8, 2018 and (b) the then - proposed cash consideration of $25.00 per share of the
Company Common Stock.

Other Information

        52-Week Historical Trading Range.    For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed the trading range for the Company Common Stock for the
52-week period ended June 8, 2018, which was $17.35 per share to $25.95 per share, and compared that range to (a) the unaffected closing price per share of the Company Common Stock of
$21.05 as of June 8, 2018, and (b) the proposed cash consideration of $25.00 per share of the Company Common Stock.

        Analyst Price Target.    For reference only and not as a component of its fairness analysis, J.P. Morgan reviewed certain publicly available equity research analyst price targets for the
Company Common Stock available as of June 8, 2018, and noted that the range of such price targets was $18.00 per share to $28.00 per share, and compared that range to (a) the unaffected
closing price per share of the Company Common Stock of $21.05 as of June 8, 2018 and (b) the proposed cash consideration of $25.00 per share of the Company Common Stock.

        Miscellaneous.    The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete
view of the processes underlying the analyses and its opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were
merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of the Company. The order of analyses
described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion, J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any
analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its
opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.

        Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly,
forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses.
Moreover, J.P. Morgan's analyses are not and do not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected
companies reviewed as described in the above summary is identical to the Company, and none of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger. However, the companies
selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan's analysis, may be considered similar to those of the
Company. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants, size and other factors, for purposes of J.P. Morgan's analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger.
The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and

operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to the Company and the transactions compared to the Merger.

        As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate
and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise the Company with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience and its qualifications and reputation in
connection with such matters and its familiarity with the Company and the industries in which it operates.

        J.P. Morgan received a fee from the Company of $1.5 million for the delivery of its opinion. The Company has agreed to pay J.P. Morgan a transaction fee of approximately
$11.85 million, against which the opinion fee will be credited, upon the consummation of the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for its expenses incurred
in connection with its services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan's engagement. During the
two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan's opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company and Siris for which J.P.
Morgan and such affiliates have received or may receive customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as lead arranger and bookrunner on the Company's
facilities which closed in April 2018, joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner on the Company's facilities which closed in May 2017, and joint lead arranger and bookrunner on the credit
facility of an affiliate of Siris which closed in May 2018. In addition, J.P. Morgan's commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of the
Company, for which J.P. Morgan receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates held, on a proprietary basis, less than 2% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock. During the two year period preceding delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees received by J.P. Morgan from the Company were approximately
$960,000 and from Siris, including fees received after the issuance of J.P. Morgan's opinion, were approximately $915,000. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its
affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company for their own accounts or for the
accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

Certain Company Forecasts

        The Company's senior management prepares projections of the Company's expected financial performance as part of its ongoing management of the business. Other than guidance in
connection with its regularly-scheduled earnings calls, as a matter of course, these projections are not publicly disclosed due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and
estimates. However, the Company is including certain unaudited prospective financial information, which we refer to as the "Company Forecasts," in this proxy statement to provide
stockholders access to a summary of certain nonpublic unaudited prospective financial information that was made available to the Company Board in connection with its consideration of the
Merger, and was also provided by the Company's senior management to BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan in connection with the rendering of their respective opinions to the Company
Board and performing their related financial analyses.

        At the direction of the Company Board, each of BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan used and relied upon the Company Forecasts in connection with performing its respective financial
analyses and for purposes of rendering its respective opinion, as summarized in the sections of this proxy statement titled "The Merger—Opinions of Web.com's Financial Advisors—Opinion
of BofA Merrill Lynch" and "The Merger—Opinions of Web.com's Financial Advisors—Opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC" of this proxy statement. The Company Forecasts were not
prepared with a view toward public disclosure and reflect

subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions based on actual results and business developments.

        The Company's internal financial forecasts, like the Company Forecasts, and the assumptions upon which the Company Forecasts were based, are subjective in many respects and thus
subject to interpretation. Although presented with numerical specificity, the Company Forecasts are forward-looking statements and are based upon a variety of estimates and numerous
assumptions made by the Company's senior management with respect to, among other matters, industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, including the factors described under the section titled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" of this proxy statement and other risk factors described in the
Company's filings with the SEC, many of which are difficult to predict, are inherently uncertain, are beyond the Company's control, are subject to significant economic and competitive
uncertainties and may not reflect current prospects for the Company's business, changes in general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, transactions or events
that have occurred or that may occur and that were not anticipated when the Company Forecasts were prepared. In addition, since the Company Forecasts cover multiple years, such
information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made in preparing the Company Forecasts
will prove accurate, that the projected results will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. In addition, the Company Forecasts do not take into
account the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, that might also cause actual results to differ materially. The Company's
stockholders are urged to review the Company's filings with the SEC for a description of the Company's actual reported results of operations and financial condition.

        The Company Forecasts are not intended to comply with, and include financial metrics that were not prepared in accordance with, GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC regarding
financial projections and the use of non-GAAP measures or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial
projections and forecasts. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-
GAAP financial measures as used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Neither Ernst & Young, LLP, the Company's independent
registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent registered public accounting firm has examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the Company Forecasts,
and, accordingly, neither Ernst & Young, LLP nor any other public accounting firm expresses an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the Company Forecasts. Reports by
Ernst & Young, LLP incorporated by reference into this proxy statement relate solely to the Company's historical financial information. They do not extend to the prospective financial
information and should not be read to do so.

        Relative to each of the non-GAAP measures Web.com presents:

Non-GAAP Revenue.    Web.com excludes from non-GAAP revenue the impact of the fair value adjustment to amortized deferred revenue because management believes that excluding
such measures helps management and investors better understand the Company's revenue trends.

Adjusted EBITDA.    Web.com excludes from adjusted EBITDA depreciation and amortization expense, loss on sale of assets, asset impairment, income tax provision, interest expense,
interest income, stock-based compensation, fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and deferred expense, corporate development expenses and restructuring expenses, because
management believes that excluding such items helps investors better understand the Company's operating activities.

Free Cash Flow.    Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that Web.com uses and defines as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company
considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about

the amount of cash generated by the business after the acquisition of property and equipment, which can then be used for investment opportunities.

        No one has made or makes any representation regarding the information included in the Company Forecasts. Stockholders and other readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to
rely unduly, if at all, on the Company Forecasts. Some or all of the assumptions that have been made regarding, among other things, the timing of certain occurrences or effects, may have
changed since the date the Company Forecasts were prepared. The Company has not updated or otherwise revised, and does not intend to update or otherwise revise, the Company Forecasts to
reflect circumstances existing after the date when prepared or to reflect the occurrence or non-occurrence of events after the date when prepared, even if any or all of the assumptions on which
the Company Forecasts were based are shown to be inaccurate. Subject to the foregoing qualifications, set forth below is a summary of the Company Forecasts.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non GAAP Results

Note: Numbers may not add due to rounding.

Vote Required and Recommendation of the Company Board

        On August 5, 2018, the Company Board duly approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, determined that it was advisable and in the
best interests of Web.com and its stockholders that Web.com enter into the Merger Agreement and consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote for adoption at the Special Meeting, and recommended that our stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby
approve the Merger.

        Adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock at the close of business on the
record date. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as "against" votes with respect to the Merger Proposal.

The Company Board unanimously recommends that the Web.com stockholders
vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal.

Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

        In considering the recommendation of the Company Board in favor of the Merger, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are
different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally. The Company Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the Merger
Agreement and the Merger. Stockholders should take these benefits into account in deciding whether to vote for adoption of the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the Merger.

Outstanding Shares Held by Executive Officers and Directors

        Each share of the Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and shares held by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or
any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of either the Company or Parent) will be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive from
Parent the Merger Consideration per share of $28.00 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes.

        Directors and executive officers will receive the same cash consideration for any shares of Web.com stock on the same terms and conditions as the other stockholders of Web.com. As of
August 30, 2018, the executive officers and directors of Web.com beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 1,568,169 shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding. This number excludes
(i) shares of the Company Common Stock that are restricted stock (as defined below), and (ii) shares of the Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Web.com stock options and
the vesting of Web.com restricted stock units.

        The following table sets forth (i) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock beneficially owned and outstanding as of August 30, 2018, by each of our executive officers and
directors and (ii) the aggregate Merger Consideration that would be payable for such shares. This table excludes shares of restricted stock, and shares issuable pursuant to stock options and
restricted stock units, which are discussed under "Conversion of Web.com Equity Awards to Merger Consideration" below.

Conversion of Web.com Equity Awards to Merger Consideration

        As described above:

• Stock Options.  As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of the
Company Common Stock granted under our equity incentive plans that is not exercised before the Effective Time ("Stock Options"), will be fully vested (to the extent not
already vested) and exercisable and to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, will be canceled with the former holder of each Stock Option becoming entitled to
receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment) equal to the product of (A) the excess of the
Merger Consideration, if any, over the exercise price per share of each Stock Option multiplied by (B) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock underlying such
Stock Option held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time. If the exercise price per share of any such Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, then such Stock Option will be canceled and terminated without any cash payment being made. 

• Restricted Stock.  As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock granted under our
equity incentive plans ("restricted stock") subject to time-based vesting restrictions will be fully vested and nonforfeitable and will be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment) equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration
multiplied by (B) the number of shares of restricted stock subject to time-based vesting held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time. As of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock subject to performance-based vesting restrictions will become fully
vested and nonforfeitable based upon an assumed achievement of 100% of the target level of performance in each performance year remaining, and such shares will be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment) equal to the product of
(A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of restricted stock subject to performance-based vesting restrictions held by such holder immediately prior
to the Effective Time. 

• Restricted Stock Units.  As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, all outstanding restricted stock units
granted under our equity incentive plans subject to time-based vesting restrictions will fully vest and any such outstanding restricted stock units of Web.com will be canceled at
the Effective Time, and, generally, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than ten business days thereafter), the holder will be entitled to
receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment) equal to the product of (A) the Merger
Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock units held by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time. As of immediately prior to the effective of the Merger, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, all unvested restricted stock units granted
under our equity incentive plans subject to performance-based vesting restrictions will become fully vested based upon an assumed achievement of 100% of the target level of
performance in each performance year remaining. Each such performance-based restricted stock unit will be canceled at the Effective Time and, generally, at the Effective Time
or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than ten business days thereafter), and the holder will become entitled to receive an amount in cash (without interest
and less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment) equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares
of the Company Common Stock subject to such restricted stock units held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        The tables below sets forth, for each of our executive officers and directors holding Company stock options that have an exercise price less than $28.00 per share, restricted stock or
restricted stock units as of August 30, 2018, (i) the aggregate number of shares subject to such stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units (whether subject to performance-based
or time-based vesting), (ii) the weighted average exercise price of such stock options, (iii) the value of such stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units on a pre-tax basis,
calculated by (a) in the case of stock options, multiplying the excess of the $28.00 over the respective per share exercise prices of the applicable stock option by the number of shares subject to
such stock options and (b) in the case of restricted stock and restricted stock units, multiplying $28.00, the Merger Consideration, by the number of shares subject to such restricted stock and
restricted stock units.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 

        Since July 7, 2018 (the period commencing 60 days prior to the filing of this proxy statement), except for 41,727 shares sold by Mr. Giuliani, 13,704 shares gifted to non-profit entities as
well as 14,033 shares sold by Ms. Quazzo, and 12,000 shares gifted by Ms. Duran to non-profit entities, none of our current executive officers or directors have sold shares of the Company
Common Stock received upon exercise of Web.com stock options or vesting of Web.com restricted stock units. Our executive officers and directors may exercise their stock options prior to the
Merger to the extent such stock options are vested in accordance with their terms.

Employment Agreements and Severance Plan

        As described in more detail below, each of the executive officers is eligible to receive certain payments and benefits either under the terms of an employment agreement (in the case of
Mr. Brown and Mr. Carney) or under the terms of the Company's Executive Severance Benefit Plan, as amended and restated effective as of March 7, 2011 (the "Severance Plan"), in the case
of Ms. Duran and Ms. Lada. The Merger will constitute a "change of control" for purposes of each of these arrangements.

David Brown

        Upon a change of control, Mr. Brown is entitled to receive the following benefits, subject to Mr. Brown's execution of an effective release of claims in favor of the Company (which
release will contain a confidentiality covenant, and a covenant not to, for two years following termination of employment, compete with the Company or solicit employees or customers of the
Company): (a) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to eighteen (18) months of Mr. Brown's current base salary plus 150% of the greater of his target bonus for the year in which the
transaction occurs or the prior year's target bonus actually earned by Mr. Brown, subject to withholdings and deductions, and (b) full vesting of his equity awards. Pursuant to his employment
agreement, Mr. Brown is entitled to receive a gross-up payment with respect to excise taxes owed due to the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code") in connection with such chance of control payments, up to a maximum of $1,000,000, but it is not anticipated that such a payment will be made in connection with the
Merger,

because the value of his benefits and payments do not exceed the relevant limits in the Code that would trigger a gross-up payment. Aside from the obligation to pay such benefits, his
employment agreement otherwise terminates automatically upon a change of control and no severance would be owed in connection with a subsequent termination.

Kevin Carney

        Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Carney's employment agreement, if Mr. Carney is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (each as defined in his amended and restated
employment agreement), he will be entitled to the following, subject to his execution of an effective release of claims in favor of the Company (which release will contain a confidentiality
covenant, and a covenant not to, for two years following termination of employment, compete with the Company or solicit employees or customers of the Company): (a) a lump sum severance
payment equal to 12 months of Mr. Carney's then-current base salary plus 100% of the greater of (i) his target bonus for the year in which the transaction occurs or (ii) the prior year's target
bonus actually earned by Mr. Carney, subject to withholdings and deductions; and (b) if Mr. Carney timely elects COBRA health insurance coverage, reimbursement by the Company of
Mr. Carney's COBRA premiums for up to 12 months following the date his employment terminates. The treatment of Mr. Carney's equity awards will be as set forth above in "Conversion of
Web.com Equity Awards to Merger Consideration."

Roseann Duran and Jennifer Lada

        Ms. Duran and Ms. Lada participate in the Severance Plan of the Company, the terms of which are described below.

Executive Severance Benefit Plan

        The Severance Plan covers certain officers (other than Messrs. Brown and Carney), and other key employees as designated by the Company Board. Pursuant to the terms of the Severance
Plan, if the participant is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (each as defined in the plan), and such termination constitutes a separation from service for purposes of
Section 409A of the Code, he or she will be entitled to the following, subject to the execution of an effective release of claims in favor of the Company (which release will contain a
confidentiality covenant, and a covenant not to, for two years following termination of employment, compete with the Company or solicit employees or customers of the Company): (a) a lump
sum severance payment equal to six months of the participant's then-current base salary plus 50% of the greater of (i) the participant's target bonus for the year in which the transaction occurs
or (ii) the prior year's target bonus actually earned by the participant, subject to withholdings and deductions; and (b) if the participant timely elects COBRA health insurance coverage,
reimbursement by the Company of the participant's COBRA premiums for up to 6 months following the date the participant's employment terminates.

        The Severance Plan provides for certain equity vesting benefits upon such a termination (six months of vesting and an extended period of exercisability if the termination is prior to a
change of control or more than 18 months after a change of control, and the greater of six months of vesting and vesting of 50% of the unvested awards if the termination occurs within
18 months following a change of control). However, the treatment of equity awards as set forth above in "Conversion of Web.com Equity Awards to Merger Consideration" (that is, full vesting
followed by cash payouts) will apply instead upon the Merger.

Potential for Future Arrangements

        The Company is permitted under the Merger Agreement to establish a cash incentive bonus program in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.5 million, pursuant to which the Company
may, in its sole discretion, award eligible Company employees, including executive officers, who continue to be employed by the Company as of the closing of the Merger, cash bonuses
payable upon the closing; unless the Parent establishes, no later than ten (10) business days prior to the closing, a cash incentive bonus plan, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to be
effective following the Closing, that provides for aggregate cash payments of at least $1.5 million to continuing Company employees, to be paid on or before the later of (a) 3 months after the
closing and (b) when Company-wide annual bonuses for 2018 are customarily paid. At the present time, the Company has not established such a cash incentive bonus program.

        In connection with Ms. Lada, to the extent payments are made to her that are required or permitted to be paid to her pursuant to the Severance Plan in connection with the consummation
of the Merger (including in connection with a qualifying termination of employment following the consummation of the Merger), including with respect to the equity awards that are held by
her as of the date of the Merger Agreement, and such payments would result in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code to her, then
the Company may, under the Merger Agreement, make a "gross-up" payment to her on account of such taxes; provided, however, that such gross-up payments may not exceed (x) $525,000
assuming that Ms. Lada is not subject to a qualifying termination, or (y) $635,000, assuming that Ms. Lada is subject to a qualifying termination. Subject to the foregoing assumptions, the
Company currently estimates such excess parachute payments would be approximately (x) $992,986, plus excise taxes of approximately $198,597 assuming that Ms. Lada is not subject to a
qualifying termination, or (y) $1,226,986, plus excise taxes of approximately $245,397, assuming that Ms. Lada is subject to a qualifying termination.

        To our knowledge, except for certain agreements described in this proxy statement between Web.com and its executive officers and directors, no other employment, equity contribution or
other agreement, arrangement or understanding between any executive officer or director of Web.com, on the one hand, and Parent or its affiliates, on the other hand, existed as of the date of
this proxy statement, and the Merger is not conditioned upon any executive officer or director of Web.com entering into any such agreement, arrangement or understanding.

        Although such arrangements have not, to our knowledge, been discussed as of the date of this proxy statement, it is possible that members of our current management team will enter into
new employment or consulting arrangements with Parent or its affiliates. Any such arrangements with the existing management team are currently expected to be entered into after the
completion of the Merger and will not become effective until after the Merger is completed, if at all. There can be no assurance that the applicable parties will reach an agreement on any terms,
or at all.

Appraisal Rights

        If the Merger is completed, holders of the Company Common Stock will be entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Section 262"),
provided that they comply with the conditions established by Section 262.

        The discussion below is not a complete summary regarding your appraisal rights under Delaware law and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the relevant provisions of
Delaware law, which are attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. Stockholders intending to exercise appraisal rights should carefully review Annex D. Failure to follow precisely any of
the statutory procedures set forth in Annex D may result in a termination or waiver of these rights.

Table of Contents

        A record holder of shares of the Company Common Stock who makes the demand described below with respect to such shares, who continuously is the record holder of such shares
through the completion of the Merger, who otherwise complies with the statutory requirements of Section 262 and who neither votes in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor
consents thereto in writing will be entitled to an appraisal by the Delaware Court of Chancery (the "Delaware Court") of the fair value of his or her shares of the Company Common Stock. All
references in this summary of appraisal rights to a "stockholder" or "holders of shares of the Company Common Stock" are to the record holder or holders of shares of the Company Common
Stock. Except as set forth herein, stockholders of Web.com will not be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.

        Under Section 262, where a Merger is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, such as the Special Meeting, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting a constituent
corporation must notify each of the holders of its stock for whom appraisal rights are available that such appraisal rights are available and include in each such notice a copy of Section 262.
This proxy statement shall constitute such notice to the record holders of the Company Common Stock.

        Stockholders who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must satisfy all of the conditions of Section 262. Those conditions include the following:

• Stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights must not vote "for" the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Also, because a submitted proxy not marked "against" or "abstain"
will be voted "for" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the submission of a proxy not marked "against" or "abstain" will result in the waiver of appraisal rights. 

• A written demand for appraisal of shares must be delivered to us before the taking of the vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting on October 10, 2018. The
written demand for appraisal should specify the stockholder's name and mailing address, and that the stockholder thereby intends to demand appraisal of his or her Company
Common Stock. The written demand for appraisal of shares is in addition to and separate from a vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or an abstention from such
vote. Merely voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not preserve your right of appraisal or constitute written demand for appraisal under Delaware law. 

• A demand for appraisal should be executed by or for the stockholder of record, fully and correctly, as such stockholder's name appears on the share certificate. If the shares are
owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, this demand must be executed by or for the fiduciary. If the shares are owned by or for more
than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, such demand should be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or
more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record. However, the agent must identify the record owner and expressly disclose the fact that, in
exercising the demand, he is acting as agent for the record owner. A person having a beneficial interest in the Company Common Stock held of record in the name of another
person, such as a broker or nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below in a timely manner to perfect whatever appraisal rights
the beneficial owners may have. 

• A stockholder who elects to exercise appraisal rights should mail or deliver his, her or its written demand to Web.com Group, Inc. at 12808 Gran Bay Parkway West,
Jacksonville, Florida 32258, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

        Within ten days after the completion of the Merger, the surviving corporation must provide notice of the completion of the Merger to all of our stockholders who have complied with
Section 262 and have not voted for the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents

        Within 120 days after the completion of the Merger, either the surviving corporation or any stockholder who has complied with the required conditions of Section 262 may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of
the fair value of the shares of all dissenting stockholders. The surviving corporation has no obligation to file such an appraisal petition, no present intent to file such a petition and stockholders
seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the surviving corporation will file such a petition or that the surviving corporation will initiate any negotiations with respect to the
fair value of such shares. Accordingly, holders of the Company Common Stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their
appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262.

        Within 120 days after the completion of the Merger, any stockholder who has satisfied the requirements of Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving
corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares of the Company Common Stock not voting in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which
demands for appraisal were received by Web.com or the surviving corporation and the number of holders of such shares. Such statement must be mailed within 10 days after the stockholders'
request has been received by the surviving corporation or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for the delivery of demands as described above, whichever is later. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition
or request from the surviving corporation the statement described in this paragraph.

        If a petition for an appraisal is timely filed, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court will determine which stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court may
require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Delaware Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder. Under Section 262, the Delaware Court shall also dismiss the proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger or consolidation
for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million. Where proceedings are not dismissed, the Delaware Court will appraise the shares of the Company Common Stock owned by such
stockholders, determining the fair value of such shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with a fair rate of interest, if
any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. However, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, Web.com may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount of cash, in which case interest will accrue after such entry of judgment only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the
shares as determined by the Delaware Court and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Web.com is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such
entry of judgment.

        Although we believe that the $28.00 per share cash consideration payable in the Merger is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by
the Delaware Court and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the consideration they would
receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Moreover, we do not anticipate that the surviving corporation will offer more than the $28.00 per share cash consideration to any stockholder
exercising appraisal rights and reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262, the "fair value" of a share of Company Common Stock is less than the
$28.00 per share Merger Consideration. In determining "fair value", the Delaware Court is required to take into account all relevant factors. The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that "proof
of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the

financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered and that "fair price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company."
The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other facts which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value
is to be exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger. The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that such exclusion is a narrow exclusion that
does not encompass known elements of value, but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. The Delaware Supreme
Court has construed Section 262 to mean that elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the Merger and not the
product of speculation, may be considered.

        The cost of the appraisal proceeding may be determined by the Delaware Court and taxed against the parties as the Delaware Court deems equitable in the circumstances. However, costs
do not include attorneys' and expert witness fees. Each dissenting stockholder is responsible for his or her attorneys' and expert witness expenses, although, upon application of a dissenting
stockholder, the Delaware Court may order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any dissenting stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of stock entitled to appraisal.

        Any stockholder who has duly demanded appraisal in compliance with Section 262 will not, after the completion of the Merger, be entitled to vote for any purpose any shares subject to
such demand or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on such shares, except for dividends or distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date prior to the completion of
the Merger.

        At any time within 60 days after the completion of the Merger, any stockholder will have the right to withdraw his demand for appraisal and to accept the $28.00 per share cash
consideration offered in the Merger Agreement. After this period, a stockholder may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and receive payment for his, her or its shares as provided in
the Merger Agreement only with the consent of the surviving corporation. If no petition for appraisal is filed with the court within 120 days after the completion of the Merger, stockholders'
rights to appraisal (if available) will cease. Inasmuch as the surviving corporation will have no obligation to file such a petition, any stockholder who desires a petition to be filed is advised to
file it on a timely basis. Any stockholder may withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal by delivering to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of his or her demand for
appraisal and acceptance of the Merger Consideration, except (i) that any such attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the completion of the Merger will require written approval of
the surviving corporation and (ii) that no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court, and such approval
may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court deems just; provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the effective
date of the Merger, as set forth in the relevant provisions of Section 262.

        Failure by any Web.com stockholder to comply fully with the procedures described above and set forth in Annex D to this proxy statement may result in termination of such stockholder's
appraisal rights. In view of the complexity of exercising your appraisal rights under Delaware law, if you are considering exercising these rights you should consult with your legal counsel.

Delisting and Deregistration of Our Common Stock

        If the Merger is completed, the Company Common Stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq Global Select Market and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

        The following summary is a general discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences to our stockholders who are U.S. persons (as defined below) whose common
stock is converted into cash in the Merger assuming the Merger is consummated as contemplated herein. This summary is based on the current provisions of the Code, applicable Treasury
Regulations, judicial authority, and administrative rulings, each as in effect as of the date hereof. These laws and authorities are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax consequences to our stockholders as described herein. The tax treatment of the Merger to our stockholders will vary depending on their
particular situations.

        This summary is for the general information of our stockholders only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects of the Merger. Accordingly, our
stockholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of the Merger, including applicable federal state, local and non-U.S. tax
consequences. For example, this summary does not consider the effect of (i) any U.S. federal non-income tax laws, (ii) any applicable state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws, or (iii) the Medicare
contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. In addition, this discussion does not address the tax consequences of transactions effectuated prior to, concurrently
with, or after the completion of the Merger (whether or not such transactions occur in connection with the Merger), including, without limitation, any transaction involving the acquisition or
disposition of shares of the Company Common Stock other than pursuant to the Merger, or the tax consequences to holders of options, warrants or similar rights to acquire the Company
Common Stock issued by Web.com which are assumed, replaced, exercised, or converted, as the case may be, in connection with the Merger. In addition, it does not address all aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation that may affect particular Web.com stockholders in light of their particular circumstances or to stockholders who are subject to special tax rules, including, without
limitation, stockholders who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• are not "U.S. persons" as defined below; 

• are broker-dealers, traders in securities, financial institutions, mutual funds, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, insurance companies, or tax-exempt
entities; 

• hold their shares as part of an integrated investment (including a hedge or as part of a hedging, "straddle," pledge against currency risk, "constructive" sale or "conversion"
transaction or other risk reduction transaction) consisting of shares of the Company Common Stock and one or more other positions; 

• hold common stock which constitutes "qualified small business stock" for purposes of Section 1202 of the Code or as "Section 1244 stock" for purposes of Section 1244 of the
Code; 

• do not hold their shares as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment); 

• are accrual-method taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code; 

• have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; 

• hold their shares through individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts; 

• acquired their shares in a transaction subject to the gain rollover provisions of Section 1045 of the Code; 

• acquired their shares pursuant to the exercise of a compensatory option or in other compensatory transactions;

• acquired their shares pursuant to the exercise of warrants or conversion rights under convertible instruments; or 

• are partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, S corporations or other pass-through
entities (including hybrid entities).

        For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. person" is a beneficial owner of the Company Common Stock that is:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States or someone treated as a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

• a corporation, including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof,
or the District of Columbia; 

• an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

• a trust, if its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust,
or a trust in existence on August 20, 1996, that has made a valid election under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

        IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING AND BECAUSE THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED AS A GENERAL SUMMARY ONLY, EACH STOCKHOLDER
SHOULD CONSULT SUCH STOCKHOLDER'S OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE,
LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND ANY TAX REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS IN LIGHT OF
SUCH STOCKHOLDER'S OWN TAX SITUATION.

In General

        The conversion of the Company Common Stock into cash in the Merger will be a taxable transaction. Generally, this means that our stockholders will recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference between (1) the amount of cash they receive in the Merger, and (2) their adjusted tax basis in their Company Common Stock. For this purpose, Web.com stockholders who acquired
different blocks of shares of the Company Common Stock at different times for different prices must calculate gain or loss separately for each identifiable block of shares of the Company
Common Stock surrendered in the exchange.

        Subject to various exceptions, a stockholder's gain or loss on the disposition of the Company Common Stock will be characterized as capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term
capital gain or loss if the stockholder has held such stockholder's Company Common Stock for more than one year as of the Effective Time. If a stockholder's holding period for any Company
Common Stock is one year or less at the Effective Time, any gain or loss with respect to such Company Common Stock will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital
gains recognized by certain non-corporate stockholders generally are currently taxable at preferential rates relative to the rates applicable to other forms of income. Capital losses are subject to
limitations on deductibility.

Appraisal or Dissenter's Rights

        A Web.com stockholder who exercises appraisal or dissenters' rights for such stockholder's Company Common Stock with respect to the Merger and receives payment for such stock in
cash will generally recognize capital gain or loss, measured by the difference between the cash received and such stockholder's tax basis in its Company Common Stock. Stockholders who
exercise appraisal or dissenters' rights are urged to consult their own tax advisors. Interest, if any, awarded in an appraisal proceeding by a

court would be included in such stockholder's income as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

        A Web.com stockholder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to certain reportable payments, including taxable proceeds received in exchange for the stockholder's shares of
the Company Common Stock in the Merger. Backup withholding will generally not apply, however, to a Web.com stockholder who furnishes the paying agent with a correct taxpayer
identification number on IRS Form W-9 (if such stockholder is a U.S. person as defined in the instructions thereto) or the appropriate IRS Form W-8 (if the stockholder is not such a U.S.
person) or otherwise establishes a basis for exemption from backup withholding. Each Web.com stockholder and, if applicable, each other payee, should properly complete and sign the IRS
Form W-9 included with the letter of transmittal (or the applicable IRS Form W-8) to provide the information and certification(s) necessary to avoid the imposition of backup withholding,
unless an exemption applies and is established in a manner satisfactory to the paying representative. Web.com stockholders who fail to provide their correct taxpayer identification numbers
and the appropriate certifications, or to establish an exemption as described above, will be subject to backup withholding on cash they receive in the Merger and may be subject to penalties
imposed by the IRS. Web.com stockholders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualifications for exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an
exemption. If the paying representative withholds on a payment to a stockholder, the affected stockholder should contact its tax advisor regarding whether and how any refund, credit or other
tax benefit might be recognized with respect to any such withheld amounts.

        THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DESCRIPTION OF ALL POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, THE DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS TAX CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY VARY WITH, OR ARE
CONTINGENT ON, A STOCKHOLDER'S INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO CERTAIN TYPES OF STOCKHOLDERS MENTIONED ABOVE. MOREOVER, THE
DISCUSSION DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY NON-INCOME TAX OR ANY NON-U.S., STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER.

Antitrust Matters

        Under the HSR Act and the rules that have been promulgated under the HSR Act, certain acquisitions may not be completed until information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division
of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") and to the FTC and applicable waiting period requirements have been satisfied or early termination of the waiting period has been granted.
The Merger of Web.com with Merger Sub and the conversion of shares of the Company Common Stock into the right to receive the Merger Consideration are subject to the provisions of the
HSR Act. The Merger therefore cannot be completed until the expiration or early termination of the waiting period following the filing of Hart-Scott-Rodino Notification and Report Forms by
the ultimate parent entity of Parent and Web.com. Both Parent and Web.com have caused the required notification and report forms to be filed. On July 20, 2018, the FTC granted early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, in connection with the Merger.

        At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, notwithstanding that the applicable waiting period has ended or approval has been granted, the FTC, the DOJ, a state, foreign
country, or private individual could take action to enjoin the Merger under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. We cannot be sure that a challenge to the Merger will not be
made or that, if a challenge is made, that we will prevail.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        This section describes the material terms of the Merger Agreement. The description of the Merger Agreement in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. This summary does not
purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its
entirety. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy
statement.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

        The Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A, and this summary of its terms are included in this proxy statement to provide you with information regarding its terms.
Factual disclosures about the Company contained in this proxy statement or in the Company's public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about
the Company contained in the Merger Agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants made in the Merger Agreement by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub were made solely to
the parties to, and solely for the purposes of, the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates and were qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and
described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party
to the Merger Agreement may have the right not to consummate the Merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or
otherwise, and allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual
standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by matters contained in the
disclosure letter that the Company delivered to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement. Moreover,
information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement. Stockholders should not rely on the representations,
warranties and covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

        The Merger Agreement provides that the closing of the Merger will take place via the electronic exchange of signatures and documentation as soon as practicable, but in any event within
three business days following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver of the conditions to closing the Merger (described under "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger")
date (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied on the closing date of the Merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions on the closing date for
the Merger), or at such other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and Parent may agree in writing. However, if the Marketing Period (described under "The Merger
Agreement—Marketing Period") has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted in the Merger Agreement, waiver of the conditions to closing the Merger (other than
those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied on the closing date of the Merger, but subject to the satisfaction of waiver of those conditions on the closing date for the Merger), the
closing of the Merger shall occur on the date following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted in the Merger Agreement, waiver of those conditions that is the earliest to occur of (a) a date
during the Marketing Period to be specified by Parent in writing on no fewer than three business days' notice to the Company and (b) the second business day following the final day of the
Marketing Period.

        The Merger will become effective upon the date and time of the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other date and time as the
Company and as may be mutually agreed by the Parent and the Company as set forth in such certificate of merger.

Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws

        The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, at which
time the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease. The Company will be the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent with all its properties, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises continuing unaffected by the Merger, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the surviving corporation.

        From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors of the surviving corporation and the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the surviving corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the charter and the bylaws of the surviving corporation.

        The certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will be amended and restated in its entirety at the Effective Time to read as set forth in
Exhibit B to the Merger Agreement until amended in accordance with applicable law and the applicable provisions of such certificate of incorporation, and the bylaws of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law and the applicable provisions of such bylaws.

Merger Consideration

        At the Effective Time, each share of the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares owned by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub and (ii) shares owned by stockholders that exercise their appraisal rights as more fully described in the section titled "The Merger—Appraisal Rights") will be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration of $28.00 per share in cash, without interest. Each share of the Company Common Stock so converted will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and each certificate or book-entry share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares thereafter will
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share covered under the Merger Agreement upon surrender of such certificate or book-entry share together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal and related documents.

Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards

Stock Options

        As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and subject to the payments described in the next sentence, all outstanding
unvested options to purchase the Company Common Stock will become fully vested and exercisable and to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time all outstanding options to
purchase the Company Common Stock will be cancelled in the Merger. At the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than three business days thereafter), each
holder of an option to purchase the Company Common Stock will, with respect to each share of the Company Common Stock subject to such option, receive an amount of cash per share equal
to the excess, if any, of $28.00 over the exercise price per share of such stock option, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding taxes.

Restricted Stock

        As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, all outstanding shares of restricted stock of Web.com subject to time-based
vesting restrictions shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable and shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash per share of restricted stock equal to $28.00, without any
interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding taxes. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, all outstanding
shares of restricted stock of Web.com subject to performance-based vesting restrictions will become fully vested and nonforfeitable based upon an assumed achievement of 100% of the target
level of performance in each performance year remaining and each share of such restricted stock will be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash per share equal to $28.00, without
any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding taxes.

Restricted Stock Units

        As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, all unvested restricted stock units of Web.com subject to time-based vesting
shall fully vest and any such outstanding restricted stock unit of Web.com will be cancelled at the Effective Time and, generally, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but
in no event later than ten business days thereafter), the holder will receive an amount of cash per share equal to $28.00, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding
taxes. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, all unvested restricted stock units of Web.com subject to performance-based
vesting restrictions will become fully vested based upon an assumed achievement of 100% of the target level of performance in each performance year remaining and will be cancelled at the
Effective Time and, generally at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than ten business days thereafter), the holder will receive an amount of cash per
share equal to $28.00, without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding taxes.

Payment of Merger Consideration and Surrender of Stock Certificates

        The Merger Agreement provides that prior to the Effective Time, Parent will select a reputable bank or trust company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the "Payment Agent"). On or
prior to the Closing Date, Parent will deposit or cause to be deposited with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the stockholders (other than
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub) in connection with the Merger in exchange for the shares held by such Stockholders, including restricted and performance shares.

        The Merger Agreement provides that the Payment Agent will mail to the record holders of certificates or book-entry shares immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of transmittal
in customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company and instructions for effecting the surrender of certificates or transfer of the book-entry shares, as applicable, in exchange for Merger
Consideration. The Payment Agent will pay the Merger Consideration to the stockholders (i) upon receipt by the Payment Agent of surrendered certificates representing the shares of the
Company Common Stock, a validly executed letter of transmittal and any other items reasonably required by the Payment Agent, and the applicable declaration required for tax withholding
purposes or (ii) after compliance with reasonable procedures established by the Payment Agent for delivery of book-entry shares, as applicable. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, Merger
Sub and the surviving corporation are entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or any other payments made in connection with the Merger Agreement any applicable
withholding taxes or other amounts such person is required to deduct or withhold and pay over under the Code or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law.

        At any time one (1) year after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation may demand that any portion of the funds made available to the Payment Agent that remains unclaimed or
undistributed to

holders of certificates or book-entry shares be delivered to the surviving corporation. Any such holders of certificates or book-entry shares (other than with respect to any shares held by a
holder who has made a demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, as described below in the section titled "The Merger—Appraisal Rights") who have not previously
surrendered their certificates or book-entry shares prior to that time may look only to the surviving corporation for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration, without interest.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed or undistributed immediately prior to such time when the such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental body will
become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of the surviving corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled to such amount.

        You should not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy card, and you should not forward your stock certificates to the Payment Agent without a letter of
transmittal.

        In exchange for your certificates or book-entry shares, as applicable, you will receive the aggregate Merger Consideration to which you are entitled in cash. The Merger Consideration will
be delivered in the form of a check to be mailed within three business days of receipt of the required deliverables, and each certificated or book-entry share will be canceled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the certificates or due transfer of the book-entry shares. Until so surrendered or delivered, as applicable, each certificate or book-
entry share will represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

        In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration for the applicable shares may be made
to a person other than the registered owner if (i) such certificates are properly endorsed or are otherwise in proper form for transfer or such book-entry shares are properly transferred, as
applicable, and (ii) the person requesting such payment pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration on account of such shares or establishes
to the reasonable satisfaction of the surviving corporation and the Payment Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

        If you have lost a certificate, or if it has been stolen or destroyed, then before you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, you must make an affidavit of the loss,
theft or destruction, and if required by Parent, post a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent on
account of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. These procedures will be described in the letter of transmittal and instructions that you will receive, which you should read
carefully in their entirety.

Appraisal Rights

        If the Merger is completed, the Company's stockholders will be entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, provided that they comply with the conditions set forth in that
statute.

        Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, if you do not wish to accept the Merger Consideration provided for in the Merger Agreement, you have the right to seek appraisal of your shares of
the Company Common Stock and to receive payment in cash for the fair value of your shares of the Company Common Stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be fair value, less any
applicable taxes required to be withheld. The "fair value" of your shares of Common Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery may be less than, equal to or more than the
Merger Consideration that you are otherwise entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. These rights are known as appraisal rights. The Company's stockholders who do not
vote in favor of the Merger Proposal and who properly demand appraisal of their shares in compliance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will be entitled to appraisal rights. Strict
compliance with the statutory procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL is required. Failure to follow precisely any of the statutory requirements will result in the loss of your appraisal
rights.

Table of Contents

        This section is intended only as a brief summary of certain provisions of the statutory procedures that a stockholder must follow under the DGCL to seek and perfect appraisal rights, and
is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL,
the full text of which appears in Annex D to this proxy statement in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL. The following summary does not constitute any legal or
other advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, if a merger agreement will be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the Company must notify the stockholders who were
stockholders of record on the record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights will be available not less than 20 days before the meeting to vote on the merger. A copy of Section 262
of the DGCL must be included with the notice.

        This proxy statement constitutes the Company's notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger. If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights,
you should carefully review the text of Section 262 of the DGCL contained in Annex D. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of the
Company Common Stock, the Company believes that a stockholder considering the exercise of such rights should seek the advice of legal counsel.

        If you wish to demand appraisal of your shares of the Company Common Stock, you must satisfy each of the following conditions: You must deliver to the Company a written demand for
appraisal of your shares of the Company Common Stock before the vote is taken to approve the Merger Proposal; the written demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the holder of
record of shares of the Company Common Stock who intends to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares of the Company Common Stock; and you must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of
the Merger Proposal.

        If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive payment for your shares of the Company Common Stock as provided in the
Merger Agreement, but you will not have appraisal rights with respect to your shares of the Company Common Stock. A holder of shares of the Company Common Stock wishing to exercise
appraisal rights must hold of record the shares of the Company Common Stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of the Company
Common Stock of record through the Effective Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted "FOR" the Merger Proposal, and it will
result in the loss of the stockholder's right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to
exercise appraisal rights must either submit a proxy containing instructions to vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal or abstain from voting on the Merger Proposal. Voting against or failing
to vote for the Merger Proposal by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to
and separate from any proxy or vote on the Merger Proposal.

        All demands for appraisal should be addressed to Web.com Group, Inc., Attention: Legal Department, 12808 Gran Bay Parkway West Jacksonville, Florida 32258, and must be delivered
to the Company before the vote is taken to approve the Merger Proposal at the Special Meeting, and must be executed by, or on behalf of, the record holder of the shares of the Company
Common Stock. The demand must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to demand appraisal of the "fair value" of his, her or
its shares of the Company Common Stock. A stockholder's failure to deliver to the Company the written demand for appraisal prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Proposal at the
Special Meeting will result in the loss of appraisal rights.

        Only a holder of record of shares of the Company Common Stock is entitled to demand an appraisal of the shares registered in that holder's name. Accordingly, to be effective, a demand
for appraisal by a

Table of Contents

holder of our the Company Common Stock must be made by, or on behalf of, the record stockholder. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the record stockholder's name as it
appears on the stockholder's stock certificate(s) or in the transfer agent's records, and in the case of uncertificated shares, should specify the stockholder's mailing address and the number of
shares registered in the stockholder's name. The demand must state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the stockholder's shares in connection with the Merger. The demand
cannot be made by the beneficial owner if he or she does not also hold the shares of the Company Common Stock of record. The beneficial holder must, in such cases, have the registered
owner, such as a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of the Company Common Stock. If you hold your shares of the Company
Common Stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or the other nominee to
determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the nominee and obtaining notice of the effective date of the Merger.

        If shares of the Company Common Stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal must be made in that
capacity. If the shares of the Company Common Stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand must be executed by or for all
joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must
identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record owner or owners. A record owner, such as a bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee, who holds shares of the Company Common Stock as a nominee for others, may exercise his or her right of appraisal with respect to shares of the Company
Common Stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of the
Company Common Stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares of the Company Common Stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares
of the Company Common Stock held in the name of the record owner. If a stockholder holds shares of the Company Common Stock through a broker who in turn holds the shares through a
central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository
nominee as record owner.

        Within 10 days after the Effective Time, the surviving corporation in the Merger must give notice of the date that the Merger became effective to each of the Company's record
stockholders who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who did not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal. At any time within 60 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder who
has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined a proceeding as a named party may withdraw the stockholder's demand and accept the Merger Consideration specified by the Merger
Agreement for that holder's shares of the Company Common Stock by delivering to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to
withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval of the surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery
will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, with such approval conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems
just. If the surviving corporation does not approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such
stockholder's right to appraisal in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the dismissal of an appraisal
proceeding, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value of his, her or its shares of the Company Common Stock determined in any such appraisal proceeding, which
value may be less than, equal to or more than the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

        Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, either the surviving corporation or any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and
is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the
fair value of the shares of the Company Common Stock held by all such stockholders. Upon the filing of the petition by a stockholder, service of a copy of such petition will be made upon the
surviving corporation. The surviving corporation has no obligation to file such a petition, has no present intention to file a petition and holders should not assume that the surviving corporation
will file a petition. Accordingly, it is the obligation of the holders of the Company Common Stock to initiate all necessary petitions to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of the
Company Common Stock within the time prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL and the failure of a stockholder to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 of the DGCL
could nullify the stockholder's previous written demand for appraisal. In addition, within 120 days after the Effective Time, any stockholder who has properly complied with the requirements
of Section 262 of the DGCL and who did not vote in favor of the Merger Proposal will be entitled to receive from the surviving corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth the
aggregate number of shares of the Company Common Stock not voted in favor of the Merger Proposal and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate
number of holders of such shares. The statement must be mailed within 10 days after such written request has been received by the surviving corporation or within 10 days after the expiration
of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of the Company Common Stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition for appraisal or request from the surviving corporation such statement.

        If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, then the surviving corporation will be obligated, within 20 days
after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded
an appraisal of their shares of the Company Common Stock and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares of the Company Common Stock have not been reached. After notice to
stockholders who have demanded appraisal from the Register in Chancery, if such notice is ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of Chancery will conduct a hearing
upon the petition and determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to the appraisal rights provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares of the Company Common Stock to submit their stock certificates to the
Register in Chancery for notation of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; if any stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the
proceedings as to that stockholder.

        After determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of the Company Common Stock, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the shares of the Company
Common Stock, determining their fair value as of the Effective Time after taking into account all relevant factors exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. When the fair value has been determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery
will direct the payment of such value upon surrender by those stockholders of the certificates representing their shares of the Company Common Stock. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery
in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will
accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the Effective Time and the date of payment of the
judgment.

        You should be aware that an investment banking opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration to be received in a sale transaction, such as the Merger, is not
an opinion as to

fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although we believe that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value that may be less than, equal to or more than the Merger
Consideration. Moreover, we do not anticipate offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal
proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the "fair value" of a share of our Company Common Stock is less than the Merger Consideration. In determining "fair value," the
Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in
determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court" should be considered and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company." The Delaware Supreme
Court has stated that in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts
which could be ascertained as of the date of the Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be
"exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion
is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or
expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court also stated that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date
of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered." Costs of the appraisal proceeding (which do not include attorneys' fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and imposed upon the surviving corporation and the stockholders participating in the appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
as it deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts used in the appraisal proceeding, to be charged pro rata
against the value of all shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to appraisal. Any stockholder who demanded appraisal rights will not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote shares
of the Company Common Stock subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive payments of dividends or any other distribution with respect to those shares of the Company Common
Stock, other than with respect to payment as of a record date prior to the Effective Time. If no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, or if the stockholder
otherwise fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses such holder's right to appraisal, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease and that stockholder will be deemed to have
been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the $28.00 cash payment (without interest) for his, her or its shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. Inasmuch as the Company has no obligation to file such a petition, and the Company has no present intention to do so, any holder of shares of the Company Common Stock who
desires such a petition to be filed is advised to file it on a timely basis. A stockholder will fail to perfect or effectively lose the right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within
120 days after the effective date of the Merger. In addition, as indicated above, a stockholder may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
and accept the Merger Consideration offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

        Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of a stockholder's statutory appraisal rights. In view of the complexity of
Section 262 of the DGCL, the Company's stockholders who may wish to pursue appraisal rights should consult their legal and financial advisors.

Table of Contents

        The foregoing is a brief summary of Section 262 that sets forth the procedures for demanding statutory appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all
applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262, a copy of the text of which is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement.

Marketing Period

        Parent is not obligated to close the Merger until a period (the "Marketing Period") has elapsed that Parent may use to complete its financing for the Merger. The Marketing Period is the
first period of 15 consecutive business days throughout which Parent has certain specified information about the Company (the "Required Information"), the Required Information remains
compliant as set forth in the Merger Agreement and no event has occurred and no conditions exist that would cause any of the conditions of Parent to consummate the Merger not to be
satisfied if the Merger were to be consummated during such period. For purposes of calculating the Marketing Period, (a) neither July 5, 2018, nor July 6, 2018, shall constitute a business day,
(b) if the Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to August 17, 2018, the Marketing Period shall not commence earlier than September 3, 2018, and (c) required delivery of specified
information required by the debt commitment letter for any fiscal period shall result in the "restart" of the Marketing Period, notwithstanding that a period of fifteen consecutive business days
shall have passed throughout which Parent has had what would otherwise have constituted the Required Information (were the closing of the Merger to have occurred prior to such required
delivery of financial information for such subsequent period) and such information having been compliant (as set forth in the Merger Agreement) throughout such period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Marketing Period will end on any earlier date on which the debt financing is obtained.

Representations and Warranties

        We made customary representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement that are subject, in many cases, to exceptions and qualifications contained in the Merger Agreement, in the
disclosure letter or in certain reports filed with the SEC. These representations and warranties relate to, among other things:

Stockholders Meeting

        We agreed, subject to our organizational documents and applicable law (and regardless of whether there has occurred an adverse recommendation change), as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date on which the staff of the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the proxy statement or that it does not intend to review the proxy statement, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the meeting of our stockholders for the purpose of seeking the approval of our stockholders of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. We must use our reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the proxy statement to be mailed to our stockholders and to hold the meeting of our
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the later of August 5, 2018, and the date on which the staff of the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the proxy

may not adjourn, postpone or recess the meeting of our stockholders without the prior written consent of Parent, but we must adjourn, postpone or recess the meeting as directed by Parent to
obtain a quorum or solicit additional votes to approve the Merger (so long as such meeting is not adjourned, postponed or recessed to a date on or after the Outside Date), subject to certain

commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to us of any Acquisition Proposal or by the making of any change in the Company Board recommendation by the
Company Board. Without limiting the foregoing, if the Company Board effects an change in the Company Board recommendation, then the Company Board must submit the Merger

Solicitation of Other Offers

        As described below, the Merger Agreement provides for a "Go-Shop Period" during which the Company was permitted to solicit, initiate, cause or induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, could constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,

delivered) that the Company Board determines in good faith (such determination to be made no later than ten (10) business days after the No-Shop Period Start Date) after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal. Such person or group of persons
will cease to be an Excluded Party at such time as such Third Person or group of Persons withdraws its Acquisition Proposal(s) or such Acquisition Proposal is abandoned. 

• "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction, on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified,
which did not result from or arise in connection with an intentional and material breach of the Merger Agreement, that if

accepted; and (ii) if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger, in each case,

regulatory aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, all the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and the Merger Agreement, the debt commitment letter, the equity
commitment letter and the Limited Guarantee, if such changes are offered by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the person making the Acquisition

        The Merger Agreement provides that during the Go-Shop Period and continuing until the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective representatives
had the right to:

• solicit, initiate, cause or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that

limited waiver under any "standstill provision" or similar obligation of any Third Person with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries to allow such Third Person to
submit an Acquisition Proposal; or 

• enter into any contract contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Transaction (as defined below) (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

        The Merger Agreement provides that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Merger Agreement which are summarized in the preceding paragraphs, the Company may continue to take any
of the actions described above with respect to any Excluded Party (for so long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party), from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earliest of
(i) the date on which the Excluded Party has terminated or withdrawn the Acquisition Proposal made prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any
amended or modified Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Excluded Party shall not be deemed to constitute, in and of itself, an expiration, termination or withdrawal of such previously
submitted Acquisition Proposal), (ii) the Third Person submitting the relevant Acquisition Proposal ceases to be an Excluded Party because the Company Board (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors), determines that such Acquisition Proposal (inclusive of any amendment or modification thereto, regardless of when delivered) does not constitute or
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (C) the receipt of the Company stockholder approval of the Merger.

        The Merger Agreement provides that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Merger Agreement which are summarized in the preceding paragraphs or elsewhere in the Merger Agreement,
at any time prior the earlier to occur of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the receipt of the Company stockholder approval, in response to a written and unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal (except to the extent solicited or continued in accordance with the Merger Agreement) and subject to the right to maintain discussions and negotiations with Excluded Parties), the
Company may contact the Third Person that delivered such Acquisition Proposal and make inquiries solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and legal counsel) that such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, the Company may, upon a good faith determination by the Company Board (after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable law:

• furnish information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries and/or provide access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or
to any personnel, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and such person's representatives); provided, that if such person is
not then a party to a confidentiality agreement with the Company, the Company and such person enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; and that any material non-
public information concerning the Company or any of its subsidiaries provided or made available to the person making such Acquisition Proposal will, to the extent not
previously provided to Merger Sub or Parent, be substantially concurrently provided or made available to Merger Sub or Parent; and 

• engage in, participate in, or facilitate discussions or negotiations with the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such Acquisition
Proposal.

        Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, during the interim period the Company will promptly advise Parent in writing, in no event later than forty-eight hours after receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal and will indicate (to the extent not prohibited by any applicable confidentiality agreement in place prior to the date of the Merger Agreement) the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer or the nature of any inquiries or contacts, and thereafter will

keep Parent reasonably informed of all material developments affecting the status and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company Board will not:

• fail to make, withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Board recommendation; 

• fail to include the Company Board recommendation in this proxy statement, when mailed; 

• make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than an unequivocal recommendation against such offer or a temporary
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act in which the Company Board or the Company
indicates that the Company Board has not changed the Company Board recommendation; 

• if reasonably requested in writing by Parent in a timely manner following the Agreement Date, fail to reaffirm the Company Board recommendation within five business days
after such request (provided, that the Company Board shall not be required to comply with more than one such request per Acquisition Proposal or amendment thereof); 

• approve, authorize, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable (or make any public announcement of its decision to approve, authorize recommend or otherwise declare
advisable) the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement requiring the Company to abandon the transactions or terminate or the Merger Agreement; or 

• cause or permit the Company or its subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any binding agreement, letter of intent, or agreement in principle with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, including any Company Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, in certain instances, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the receipt of the stockholder approval of the Merger Agreement, change the Company
Board recommendation; or terminate the Merger Agreement, provided, that:

• the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to change the Company Board recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in
response to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is not related to a Superior Proposal, contain a description of the
events, facts and circumstances giving rise to such proposed action or, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is a Superior Proposal, contain a description of
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal; and 

• Parent does not make, within one (1) business day after the receipt of such notice, a binding proposal that would cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to
no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, provided that for one business day, the Company and its representatives shall, to the extent Parent desires to negotiate, negotiate in
good faith with Parent and its representatives.

Efforts to Close the Transaction

        The Merger Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agreed to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Employee Benefits

        For a period of one year following the Effective Time, with respect to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries who are actively employed at the Effective Time and who remain
employed during such one year period (the "Continuing Employees"), Parent will, or will cause the Company or any subsidiary of the Company to, provide (i) at least the same level of base
wages or base salary, as applicable that were provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cash bonus opportunities (excluding any equity compensation)
that in the aggregate, are at least the same as were provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) employee benefits that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to the employee benefits that were provided by the Company and its subsidiaries to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) severance benefits that
are no less favorable than those disclosed in the disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement. Additionally, Parent will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, grant all Continuing Employees
credit for any service to the Company and its subsidiaries earned prior to the closing of the Merger for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of benefits, vacation or paid
time off accrual and severance benefit determinations, under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement in which a Continuing Employee participates that may be
established or maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries on or after the closing of the Merger (the "New Plan"); provided, however, that such service credit shall not be recognized to the extent
that it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of time. In addition, Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, cause (i) to be waived all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or
satisfied by a Continuing Employee under any Company benefit plan as of the closing of the Merger and (ii) any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid on or before
the closing of the Merger by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the closing of the Merger under any applicable New Plan in the same plan year in which the closing of the Merger occurs.

Financing

        Parent's obligation to complete the Merger is not conditioned on Parent's receipt of any financing. Parent has secured committed financing, consisting of a combination of (i) equity to be
provided by Siris Partners III, L.P., Siris Partners III Parallel, L.P., Siris Partners IV, L.P. and Siris Partners IV Parallel, L.P., which are affiliates of Siris and/or one or more of their permitted
assignees, and (ii) debt financing to be provided by affiliates of Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. ("MSSF"), Royal Bank of Canada ("Royal Bank"), RBC Capital Markets ("RBCCM"),
Macquarie Capital Funding LLC ("Macquarie Lender") and Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. ("Macquarie Capital" and, together with Macquarie Lender, "Macquarie", Macquarie Lender,
Macquarie Capital, MSSF, Royal Bank and RBCCM are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Debt Commitment Parties").

        In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, Parent delivered to us copies of the amended and restated debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of the Merger Agreement,
from the Debt Commitment Parties, pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the lenders have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein, which amounts together
with the cash balances of Parent and its affiliates, will be sufficient to enable Parent and Merger Sub to make all payments required to be made in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement.

        Under the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub will use their reasonable best efforts to consummate on a timely basis to facilitate the closing of the Merger and the financing
contemplated by the amended and restated debt commitment letter on the terms set forth therein. In the event any portion of the financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the amended and restated debt commitment letter, Parent will promptly notify us and Parent and Merger Sub will use their respective

reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent or
Merger Sub, than the amended and restated commitment letter and in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

        In connection with Parent's efforts to arrange the financing, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to provide, and will use our reasonable best efforts to cause our subsidiaries to
provide, such customary and necessary cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including (i) reasonably cooperating with
due diligence efforts of Parent and the financing sources, including assisting with the furnishing Parent with the customary information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries which is
required for the preparation of pro forma financial statements, credit agreements (and security documentation related thereto) and similar documents required in connection with the debt
financing, (ii) reasonable best efforts to furnish Parent, as promptly as reasonably practical following Parent's reasonable request, such financial information regarding the Company and its
subsidiaries as is customarily required in connection with the executing of financings of a type similar to the debt financing, (iii) reasonably cooperating to permit the prospective lenders
involved in the debt financing to evaluate the Company and its subsidiaries' current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose
of establishing collateral arrangements to the extent customary and reasonable and otherwise reasonably facilitating the grant of a security interest in the collateral and guarantees, in each case,
as contemplated by the debt financing, (iv) using reasonable best efforts to cause the Company and each of its subsidiaries' senior officers to participate in a reasonable numbers of meetings,
presentations and other sessions and assist with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda and similar documents reasonable required or
requested in connection with the debt financing, (v) obtaining any authorization or consent reasonably necessary or required in connection with the debt financing, (vi) obtaining customary
payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at the closing of the Merger to allow for the payoff, discharge and termination in full all indebtedness of the
Company required to be terminated and released substantially concurrently with the closing of the Merger, (vii) promptly (but in any event, at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date)
furnishing Parent and the financing sources with all documentation and other information requested by the financing sources in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the closing of the Merger
which are required under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and provide beneficial ownership certifications
required pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 1010.230, (viii) executing and delivering any credit agreements, pledge and security documents, guarantees and other definitive financing documents or
requested customary certificates and documents, and (ix) reasonably facilitating the taking of all corporate actions reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the financing.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Merger Agreement will (i) require the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their representatives to waive or amend any terms of the Merger
Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or other fees or reimburse any expenses in connection with the financing that are not contingent upon the closing of the Merger or incur any actual
or potential liability or obligation or give any indemnities in connection with the financing that are not contingent upon the closing of the Merger, (ii) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries or create an unreasonable risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
(iii) require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to take any action that will conflict with or violate the Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, any laws or result in the
contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any material contract not entered in contemplation of the Merger Agreement to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, (iv) require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into or approve any financing or purchase agreement for the financing prior
to the Effective Time, (v) result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge of the duties of any of the Company's executive officers or senior management, (vi) result

subsidiaries to consent to the prefiling of UCC-1 financing statements or any other grant of lien or other encumbrances prior to the Effective Time or (viii) require any of the pre-closing boards
of directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any resolutions or take similar action to approve or authorize the execution thereof. Neither the Company, nor any of its
subsidiaries or their respective representatives will have any liability or incur any losses, damages or penalties with respect to the debt financing in the event the closing of the Merger does not
occur. Notwithstanding the above, all corporate, limited liability or other organizational actions shall be deemed to become effective only if and when the closing occurs and shall be derived
exclusively from the authority of, and shall only be taken by, the Company Board, the boards of directors of the Company subsidiaries or other governing body of the Company and its
subsidiaries as constituted after giving effect to the closing.

        Parent will promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses to the extent such costs are
incurred by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation provided by the Company in connection with Parent's financing activities. Parent also agreed to
indemnify and hold harmless, the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than any information
prepared or provided by the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law except, in each case, to the extent resulting
from fraud or willful misconduct of the Company or its subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives as determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

Limited Guarantee

Partners III Parallel, L.P., Siris Partners IV, L.P. and Siris Partners IV Parallel, L.P. (the "guarantors") agreed to guarantee as and when due on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

acquisition agreement.

Effect of Termination

        If the Merger Agreement is terminated as described in the section titled "The Merger—Termination", the Merger Agreement will be void and have no effect, and there will not be any
liability or obligation on the part of any party, except that:

• certain other provisions of the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, with respect to indemnification, specific performance, expense reimbursement, and the
allocation of fees and expenses, including, if applicable, the termination fees described below, will survive termination; 

• no termination will affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement or the Limited Guarantee; and 

• no termination will relieve the Company from liability for willful breach of a representation, warranty or covenant contained in the Merger Agreement.

Termination Fees

• if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Parent because a Triggering Event has occurred; 

• if the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company because the Company Board authorizes the Company to concurrently with such termination enter into a definitive

Company or the Company has failed to perform or comply with any of its covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, and (iii) within nine (9) months after
such termination, the Company will have entered into a definitive written agreement for, or consummates, any Acquisition Transaction (for purposes of this provision, all
references to 15% in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" shall be deemed to be references to 50%).

        The parties agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay the termination fee on more than one occasion.

        Parent has agreed to pay the Company a termination fee of $85.06 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company (i) pursuant to the termination right that arises in the
context of the Parent's or Merger Sub's breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in the Merger Agreement that would result in a material adverse effect on the ability of
Parent to consummate the Merger in a timely manner, or Parent or Merger Sub has failed to perform or comply with any of its covenants or agreements contained in the Merger Agreement in
any material respect, in each case subject to the cure period set forth in the Merger Agreement, or (ii) Parent has failed to consummate the Merger (as such termination right is described above)
when required under the Merger Agreement

Expenses

        Except in certain circumstances expressly provided in the Merger Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement will be paid by the party incurring
such cost or expense.

Specific Performance

        The parties have agreed that irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of the Merger
Agreement are not performed by the other party in accordance with the terms thereof or are otherwise breached. Each party has agreed to waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or
similar collateral in connection with the obtaining of any injunctive relief or specific performance. The non-breaching party is therefore entitled to specific performance and the issuance of
injunctive and other equitable relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, the parties agreed that Parent has an obligation to cause the equity financing to be
funded, including by exercising its rights under the amended and restated equity commitment letter, provided that the Company's right to cause Parent to draw on the equity financing is subject
to certain conditions including the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions in the Merger Agreement and the availability of the debt financing.

Amendments and Waivers

        At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Agreement may be amended in all respects, by written agreement signed by each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company except that
the provisions in the Merger Agreement relating to financing sources to the extent that an amendment, modification, waiver or termination of such provision would effectively modify the
substance of the financing sources' provisions, may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to financing sources without the prior
written consent of the financing sources.

        Subject to the prior written consent requirement above and subject to applicable law, at any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company, as applicable, may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties, in the case of Parent, of the Company and, in the
case of the Company, of Parent or Merger Sub, in each case, contained in the Merger Agreement (or in any other document delivered pursuant thereto) and (c) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions, in the case of Parent, of the Company and, in the case of the Company, of Parent or Merger Sub, in each case, contained in the Merger Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

PROPOSAL 1—THE MERGER PROPOSAL 

The Merger Proposal

        We are asking you to approve a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, which we refer to as the Merger
Proposal. For a detailed discussion of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, see section titled "The Merger Agreement" in this proxy statement. A copy of the Merger Agreement
is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. See also "The Merger" in this proxy statement.

Vote Required

        Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote as of the close of
business on the record date. Failure to vote your shares, an abstention from voting your shares, or a broker non-vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Proposal.

        As described under the section titled "The Merger—Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger" of this proxy statement, after considering various factors described in such
section, the Company Board has determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of
Web.com and our stockholders. The Company Board has approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
and the Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the Merger Proposal.

Recommendation of the Company Board

        The Company Board unanimously recommends that
you vote "FOR" the approval of the Merger Proposal.

PROPOSAL 2—EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL 

The Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation for Named Executive Officers

        Section 14A of the Exchange Act requires that Web.com provide its stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Merger-related
compensation arrangements for Web.com's named executive officers (defined, for the purposes of the Exchange Act rules relating to this approval, as those officers who appeared in our most
recently-filed summary compensation table and related compensation disclosures) as disclosed in "The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger," beginning on
page 53.

Compensation Related to Transaction or Subsequent Termination

        This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation for each of our named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates
to the Merger. This compensation is referred to as "golden parachute" compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules. The amounts set forth in the table are estimates based on multiple
assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement and in the footnotes to the table. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, that a named
executive officer receives may materially differ from the amounts set forth in the table.

        The table below assumes that (1) the Merger will occur on October 10, 2018 with a per-share price of $28.00, (2) the employment of the named executive officer will be terminated on
such date in a manner entitling the named executive officer to receive severance payments and benefits under the terms of the named executive officer's employment agreement or the
severance plan, (3) the named executive officer's base salary rate, target bonus and COBRA premium rate will remain unchanged, (4) no named executive officer receives any additional equity
grants or exercises any stock options on or prior to the Merger and (5) no named executive officer enters into a new agreement or is otherwise legally entitled to, prior to the Merger, additional
compensation or benefits. The amounts shown in the table do not include the value of payments or benefits that would have been earned, or any amounts associated with equity awards that
would vest pursuant to their terms, on or prior to the Merger, or the value of payments or benefits that are not based on or otherwise related to the Merger. In the footnotes to the amounts
shown in the table below, we refer to payments that are conditioned on both the occurrence of the Merger as well as the named executive officer's termination of employment as being payable
on a "double-trigger" basis and we refer to payments that are conditioned only upon the occurrence of the Merger as being payable on a "single-trigger" basis. The individuals named below
represent the named executive officers that were in our annual proxy with respect to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017.

Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Insurance

        Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, members of the Company Board and our executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies following the Merger. For a more detailed description of the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to director and officer
indemnification, please see "The Merger Agreement—Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Insurance" (page 97).

        The Company Board encourages you to review carefully the named executive officer Merger-related compensation information disclosed in this proxy statement, and to cast a vote either
to approve or disapprove, on an advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Web.com's named executive officers in connection with the Merger, through the
following resolution:

"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Web.com approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation to be paid by Web.com to its named executive officers, that is based
on, or otherwise relates to, its proposed acquisition by Parent, Inc., in the table set forth in the section of the proxy statement for the Merger titled "The Merger—Interests of Our
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger," and in the related notes and narrative disclosure."

        The advisory vote on the Merger-related compensation for Web.com's named executive officers is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly,
you may vote for adoption of the resolution to approve, on an advisory basis, the Merger-related compensation for Web.com's named executive officers and vote not to adopt the Merger
Agreement or vice versa. Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and the vote with respect to this proposal is advisory only. Because the vote is advisory only,
it will not be binding on either Web.com or Parent.

Vote Required and Recommendation of the Company Board

        The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon, provided there is a quorum, is required for
approval of this proposal on an advisory (non-binding) basis.

PROPOSAL 3—AUTHORITY TO ADJOURN OR POSTPONE THE SPECIAL MEETING 

The Adjournment Proposal

        If at the Special Meeting of stockholders, the number of shares of the Company Common Stock represented and voting in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement is insufficient to
adopt that proposal under the Delaware General Corporation Law, we may move to adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting to enable the Company Board to solicit additional proxies in
respect of such proposal. In that event, we will ask our stockholders to vote only upon the Adjournment Proposal, and not the Merger Proposal or the Executive Compensation Proposal.

        In this proposal, we are asking you to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Company Board to vote in favor of granting discretionary authority to the proxy or attorney-in-fact
to adjourn the Special Meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. If the stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn or postpone
the Special Meeting and any adjourned or postponed session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from
stockholders that have previously voted. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes
against the approval of the Merger Agreement to defeat that proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a vote on the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those
shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement.

        Failure of this proposal to pass will not affect the ability of the holder of any proxy solicited by us to adjourn the Special Meeting in the event insufficient shares of the Company Common
Stock are represented to establish a quorum, or for any other lawful purpose.

Vote Required and Recommendation of the Company Board

        Approval of the proposal to adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting proxies, if necessary or appropriate, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting and voting on the matter.

        The Company Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to be able to adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary
or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting.

        Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the
proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect in determining whether or not the proposal is approved.

The Company Board unanimously recommends that the Company stockholders

Adjournments and Postponements

        The Special Meeting may be adjourned or postponed without notice, other than by the announcement made at the Special Meeting, by approval of the holders of a majority of the shares
of the Company Common Stock present, in person or by proxy. We are soliciting proxies to grant the authority to vote in favor of adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting. In
particular, authority is expected to be exercised if the purpose of the adjournment or postponement is to provide additional time to solicit votes in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement.
The Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote in favor of the Adjournment Proposal. In addition, if a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, the Special Meeting may be
adjourned by the chairman of the Special Meeting or by the vote of a majority of the shares represented at the Special Meeting, regardless of whether the Adjournment Proposal is approved,
but no other business will be transacted at the Special Meeting until a quorum is present.

Future Stockholder Proposals

        If the Merger is consummated, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of our stockholders. However, if the Merger is not
consummated, our stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in meetings of our stockholders.

        We intend to hold an Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2019 only if the Merger is not consummated. If the Merger is not consummated, please see below for timing of stockholder
proposals relating to our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

        To be considered for inclusion in next year's proxy materials, your proposal must be submitted in writing by February 8, 2019, to the Secretary of Web.com at 12808 Gran Bay Parkway
West, Jacksonville, Florida 32258. All proposals must comply with Rule 14a-8 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

        A stockholder nomination for director or a proposal that will not be included in next year's proxy materials, but that a stockholder intends to present in person at next year's annual
meeting, must comply with the notice, information and consent provisions contained in the Company's Bylaws. In part, the Bylaws provide that to timely submit a proposal or nominate a
director you must do so by submitting the proposal or nomination in writing, to the Company's Secretary at the Company's principal executive offices no later than the close of business on
February 8, 2019, (90 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2018 Annual Meeting Date) nor earlier than the close of business on January 9 2019 (120 days prior to the first anniversary of
the 2018 Annual Meeting Date). In the event that the Company sets an annual meeting date for 2019 that is not within 30 days before or after the anniversary of the 2018 Annual Meeting date,
notice by the stockholder must be received no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
90th day prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting is first made. The Company's Bylaws
contain additional requirements to properly submit a proposal or nominate a director. If you plan to submit a proposal or nominate a director, please review the Company's Bylaws carefully.
You may obtain a copy of the Company's Bylaws by mailing a request in writing to the Secretary of Web.com at 12808 Gran Bay Parkway West, Jacksonville, Florida 32258.

of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Charter and the Bylaws.

        Section 1.5    Conversion and Exchange of Shares.     

                (a)   At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Merger Sub, Parent, the Company or any stockholder of the Company or Merger Sub:

                        (i)    each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Shares") (other than (x) shares of Company Common Stock held
by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent ("Excluded Shares") and (y) shares of Company Common Stock
with respect to which the holder thereof has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented to it in writing, has demanded the appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and shall have
properly exercised and perfected such holder's demand for appraisal rights with respect to such shares in compliance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares"))
shall be converted into the right to receive, in accordance with this Article I, twenty-eight dollars ($28.00) in cash per share, without interest (the per share cash consideration to be issued to the
holders of such Shares, the "Merger Consideration");

                        (ii)   each share of Company Common Stock converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(i) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Shares (each, a "Certificate") or Shares represented by
book-entry (the "Book-Entry Shares") (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for each share covered thereby upon surrender of such Certificate or transfer of such Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Article I;

                        (iii)  each Excluded Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, shall cease to be outstanding and shall be automatically
cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist; and

                        (iv)  each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted
into one (1) newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

                (b)   If, during the period commencing on the Agreement Date and ending at the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger, issuer tender offer, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock, then the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted; provided that the Company shall be required to comply with Section 4.2 in connection with any such action.

        Section 1.6    Company Equity Awards.     

                (a)   Company Options.    Neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall assume any Company Options or substitute for any Company Option any option for Merger Sub or Parent equity, in
connection with the Merger or any other Transactions. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the
part of any optionholder, except as set forth in Section 1.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules: (i) all Unvested Company Options outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall fully vest and become exercisable, and become Vested Company Options, and (ii) to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option shall be cancelled,
with each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option becoming entitled to receive, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than three
(3) Business Days thereafter), in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as
contemplated in Section 1.9), equal to the product of: (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of each such Company Option; and (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option; provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled and terminated without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

                (b)   Company Restricted Shares.

                        (i)    As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each
share of Company Common Stock subject to time-based vesting restrictions granted under a Stock Plan (a "Company Restricted Share") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable and shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

                        (ii)   As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each
share of Company Common Stock subject to performance-based vesting restrictions granted under a Stock Plan (a "Company Performance Share") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable based upon an assumed achievement of one hundred percent (100%) of the target level of performance in each and every
performance year remaining. Such vested Company Performance Shares shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

                (c)   Company RSUs.

                        (i)    Neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall assume any Company RSU or substitute for any Company RSU any similar award for Merger Sub or Parent equity, in connection with
the Merger or any other Transactions.

                        (ii)   As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any holder of Company
RSUs, all Unvested Company RSUs outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and become Vested Company RSUs. In the case of Unvested Company RSUs
that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the number of Unvested Company RSUs that become Vested Company RSUs shall be based upon an assumed achievement of one
hundred percent (100%) of the target level of performance in each and every performance year remaining.

                        (iii)  Each Vested Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled at the Effective Time, and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to each former holder of any such Vested Company RSU, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
thereafter), an amount in cash (without

interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in Section 1.9) equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU; provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Vested Company
RSU which immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for such Vested
Company RSU if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

                (d)   Payment of Company Options and Vested Company RSUs.    Parent shall take all actions necessary so that, no later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time (or such
later time required by the proviso included in Section 1.6(c)(iii)), the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of Employee Options and Vested Company RSUs the
amounts to which such holder is entitled as determined in accordance with this Section 1.6 through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation or the applicable Company Subsidiary, and shall
pay to each holder of Non-Employee Options the amounts to which such holder is entitled as determined in accordance with this Section 1.6 through the standard accounts payable procedures
of the Surviving Corporation or the applicable Company Subsidiary. In the event that the Surviving Corporation has insufficient cash to make such payment to each holder of Company
Options and Company RSUs as of the Effective Time, Parent shall pay such amounts or provide to the Surviving Corporation, on the Closing Date, sufficient cash to pay such amounts.

                (e)   Further Actions.    The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) shall take such actions as are necessary to approve and
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.6, including making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof or any administrator of a Stock
Plan as may be necessary.

        Section 1.7    Closing of the Company's Transfer Books.     At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further registrations or transfers of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Payment Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall be marked cancelled and
shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.8 below.

        Section 1.8    Surrender of Certificates.     

                (a)   Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the "Payment Agent"). On or prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Payment Agent, separate and apart from its other funds, for the purpose of exchanging Merger Consideration for Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares), cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 1.5 with respect to such Shares, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Restricted Shares and the Company Performance Shares. The cash amount so deposited
with the Payment Agent is referred to as the "Payment Fund." The Payment Agent will invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by Parent; provided, however, that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly
available). Any interest or other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be the property of Parent.

                (b)   As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) (A) a letter of

transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Payment Agent) and/or (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

                (c)   Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall, upon (A) surrender to the Payment Agent of Certificates for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, and the applicable declaration for Tax withholding purposes, or (B) compliance with the reasonable procedures established by the Payment Agent for delivery of Book-Entry
Shares, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect thereof and the Certificates so surrendered and Book-Entry Shares so transferred shall
forthwith be cancelled, subject to Section 1.9. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or due transfer of the Book-Entry Shares. The
Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Until so surrendered or delivered, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I.

                (d)   In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in a reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may determine as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Payment Agent will issue the Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.
Delivery of such affidavit and the posting of such bond, if so required, shall be deemed delivery of a Certificate with respect to the relevant Common Shares for purposes of this Article I.

                (e)   In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of the applicable
Shares may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates so surrendered or the Book-Entry Shares so transferred are registered if such Certificates shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Shares shall be properly transferred and, in each case, the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation and the
Payment Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

                (f)    Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed or undistributed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date that is one (1) year after the Closing
Date shall be delivered to or as directed by the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any such holder who has not previously complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of any such holder's claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of any Certificate or to any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

                (g)   Any portion of the Payment Fund made available to the Payment Agent to pay for Dissenting Shares shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon Demand.

        Section 1.9    Withholding Rights.     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (each, a "Payor") shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as such Payor is required to deduct or withhold
and pay over to the appropriate Governmental Authority with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law or under any other
applicable Law. Each Payor shall request from and allow recipients of consideration a reasonable opportunity to provide documentation establishing exemptions from or reductions of such
withholdings. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the applicable Payor in accordance with applicable Law, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

        Section 1.10    Transfer Taxes.     All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value-added and other similar Taxes and fees incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by Parent.

        Section 1.11    Appraisal Rights.     

                (a)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 1.5(a)(i), but rather, the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the appraisal value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 1.9 with respect to such payment (and, at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the appraisal value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL); provided, that, if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and payment under and to the extent set forth in and in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the Effective
Time), then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration (without interest thereon) as provided in Section 1.5(a)(i), and such shares shall
not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.

                (b)   The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL or
any other written communication with the Company that relates to a demand for appraisal or payment with respect to Dissenting Shares; (B) any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any
such demand; and (C) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL with respect to the exercise or purported exercise of
appraisal rights; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in, at Parent's election and expense, all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment or settlement offer or settle any
such demands prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled under Section 262 of the DGCL to
receive payment of the "fair value" for such holder's shares shall receive such payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation after giving effect to any withholdings received by applicable
Law (but only after the amount thereof shall have been finally determined pursuant to the DGCL), and such shares shall be retired and cancelled as of the Effective Time. Any payments
required to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or, if the Payment Fund is being

basis, as if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not been a stockholder on the Closing Date.

        Section 1.12    Further Action.     If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take and shall take such action.

ARTICLE II
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

        Except as set forth in (i) the reports, schedules, forms, registration statements and other documents (including exhibits and all information incorporated by reference) filed by the
Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") prior to the Agreement Date (in each case, each, an "Available Company SEC Document"), or (ii) the
Company Disclosure Schedules (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein; provided that any
disclosure set forth with respect to any particular section shall be deemed to be disclosed in reference to all other applicable sections of this Agreement if the disclosure in respect of the
particular section is sufficient on its face without further inquiry reasonably to inform Parent of the information required to be disclosed in respect of such other sections)) delivered by the
Company to Parent on the Agreement Date (the "Company Disclosure Schedules"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Merger Sub and Parent as follows:

        Section 2.1    Organization.     Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company (the "Company Subsidiaries") is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership
duly organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all
requisite power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, foreign qualifications, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to own, operate and lease
its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, except for such franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals, the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company which are incorporated by
reference as exhibits to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the "Company Charter Documents") are complete and correct copies of such
documents and contain all amendments thereto as in effect on the Agreement Date.

        Section 2.2    Capitalization.     

                (a)   The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 98,200,000 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) 33,300,693 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per
share, ("Company Preferred Stock"). As of the close of business on August 1, 2018 (the "Capitalization Date"): (A) 50,092,668 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and

exercise price of all such Company Options with an exercise price below the Merger Consideration, as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, was $15.5853096 per share. The
Conversion Rate (as defined in the Company Convertible Notes Indenture) in respect of the Company Convertible Notes is 28.5714 shares of Company Common Stock per $1,000 in principal
amount of the Company Convertible Notes.

                (b)   Since the Capitalization Date and through the Agreement Date, the Company has not authorized the creation or issuance of, or issued, or authorized or effected any split-up or
any other recapitalization of, any of its capital stock, or directly or indirectly redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired any of its outstanding capital stock. The issued and outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock have been, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to any Stock Plan or as contemplated or permitted by this Agreement will be, when issued in accordance
with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. The Stock Plans and all award agreement thereunder provide that
in the case of Company Equity Awards that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions which are not assumed in a change of control transaction, such Company Equity Awards shall
accelerate upon such upon a change of control with respect to one hundred percent (100%) of the shares of Company Common Stock that would vest assuming achievement of one hundred
percent (100%) of the target level of performance.

                (c)   The Company has made available to Parent or its counsel complete copies of the Stock Plans and the forms of stock option, restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards and
agreements evidencing the Company Equity Awards. The Stock Plans are the only material plans under which the Company has issued, granted or awarded stock options, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, performance shares or other compensatory equity or equity-based awards that are outstanding as of the Agreement Date. Except with respect to the redemption and
repurchase rights and obligations of the Company with respect to the Company Convertible Notes pursuant to the Company Convertible Notes Indenture, the Company does not have any
material outstanding contractual obligations to redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company. Other than the Company Common Stock and the
Company Convertible Notes, there are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness or securities of the Company having the right to vote (or, other than the outstanding
Company Equity Awards, convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote. Except as set forth in
Section 2.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedules and the Company Convertible Notes Indenture, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any material agreement,
arrangement or understanding (including any voting agreements, voting trusts or proxies, stockholders agreements, "poison pill" or rights agreement or registration rights agreements) with
respect to the voting, registration, sale, purchase or transfer of any capital stock or with respect to other Company securities or securities of any wholly-owned Company Subsidiary.

                (d)   Except for the securities (w) set forth in Section 2.2(a), (x) issuable upon the exercise of Company Stock Options, (y) issuable upon the vesting of Company RSUs or (z) the
issuance of which is permitted by Section 4.2 or was consented to by Parent, as of the Capitalization Date, (i) no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company are issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding, and (ii) there are no outstanding securities, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance shares or units, options, warrants, calls, rights (including
stock appreciation rights and contingent value rights), "phantom" stock or similar securities commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind (other than this Agreement) to
which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound (the items described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 2.2(d) being referred to
collectively as the "Company Securities") obligating the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to (A) issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of the Company or of any of the Company Subsidiaries, (B) issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right, commitment,

                (a)   Since January 1, 2015, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been and are in compliance with the following Laws:(i) the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
(15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1, et seq.) (the "FCPA"), (ii) the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and (iii) any applicable Law promulgated to implement the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign
Public Officials in International Business Transactions, signed on December 17, 1997 (collectively, the "Anti-Corruption Laws"), except for any such failure to comply that would not, or
would not reasonably be expected to individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                (b)   Since January 1, 2015, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor to the Company's Knowledge, any director, officer, employee, agent or representative of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with its performance of its business with the Company has, directly or indirectly, given, made, offered or received or agreed to
give, make, offer or receive any payment, gift, contribution, commission, rebate, promotional allowance, expenditure or other economic advantage: (a) in violation of any applicable Anti-
Corruption Law; or (b) to or for a Public Official with the intention of: (i) improperly influencing any official act or decision of such Public Official; (ii) inducing such Public Official to do or

director or officer) is a non-U.S. Public Official.

                (c)   Since January 1, 2015, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor to the Company's Knowledge, any director, officer, employee, agent or representative of

and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives with applicable Anti-
Corruption Law.

consummation by Merger Sub and Parent of the Transactions will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time): (i) result in a violation or breach of or conflict with the
certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws, or other similar organizational documents of Merger Sub or Parent; (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the

Parent to consummate the Transactions (a "Parent Material Adverse Effect").

                (b)   No Governmental Approval is necessary to be obtained or made by Merger Sub or Parent in connection with Merger Sub's and Parent's execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement or the consummation by Merger Sub or Parent of the Transactions, except for (i) compliance with the DGCL (including, with respect to the filing of the Certificate of Merger),

Merger Sub or Parent. There are no material Judgments of any Governmental Authority or Person outstanding or in effect against Merger Sub or Parent.

        Section 3.5    Activities of Merger Sub.     Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the Merger. Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the Effective Time engage in any
activities other than those contemplated by this Agreement and has, and will have as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, no liabilities other than those contemplated by this Agreement.
All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

        Section 3.6    Information Supplied.     None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Merger Sub or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement, as of the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, and at the time of the Company Stockholders' Meeting, will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion therein.

        Section 3.7    No Other Company Representations or Warranties.     Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a sophisticated purchaser, possesses such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment under this Agreement. In entering into this Agreement and each of the other documents and instruments
relating to the Merger referred to herein, Parent and Merger Sub have each relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis, and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that except
for the representations and warranties set forth in Article II (which to the extent provided for in this Agreement are subject to the Company Disclosure Schedules and the Available Company
SEC Documents), Merger Sub and Parent hereby acknowledge and agree that: (a) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
securityholders, controlling persons, or Representatives or any other Person, has made or is making any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or
Company Subsidiaries or their respective business, operations, technology, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, prospects, projections, budgets, estimates or operational
metrics, or as to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided (including any statement, document or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any financial statements
and any projections, estimates or other forward-looking information) provided (including in any management presentations, information or descriptive memorandum, the Dataroom, any other
"data rooms" maintained by the Company, supplemental information or other materials or information with respect to any of the above) or otherwise made available to Merger Sub, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person; and (b) except in the cause of Fraud, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, securityholders, controlling persons, or Representatives or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation or other obligation of any kind or nature to Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person on any basis (including in
contract or tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise), resulting from the delivery, dissemination or any other distribution to Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person, or the use by Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person, of any such information
provided or made available or statements made (or any omissions therefrom) to any of them by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, or any of their

respective Affiliates, stockholders, securityholders, controlling persons, or Representatives or any other Person, including any information, documents, estimates, projections, forecasts or other
forward-looking information, business plans or other material provided or made available to Merger Sub, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person, in
the Dataroom, any other "data rooms," confidential information memoranda or management presentations in anticipation or contemplation of the Merger or any other Transactions.

        Section 3.8    Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans.     In connection with the due diligence investigation of the
Company by Merger Sub and Parent and their respective Affiliates and Representatives, Merger Sub and Parent and their respective Affiliates and Representatives have received and may
continue to receive after the Agreement Date from the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well
as certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its business and operations. Merger Sub and Parent hereby acknowledge and agree that: (a) there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with which Merger Sub and Parent are familiar; (b) Merger
Sub and Parent are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business
plans); and (c) except in the cause of Fraud, Merger Sub and Parent hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim against the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives with respect to any information described in this Section 3.8, and have relied solely on the results of their own independent
investigation and on the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants made by the Company and contained in this Agreement. Accordingly, Merger Sub and Parent acknowledge and
agree that none of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, securityholders, controlling persons or Representatives, has made or is making
any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans (including the reasonableness of
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans) except as set forth in this Agreement and, except in the cause of Fraud, each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its Representatives not to, hold any such Person liable with respect thereto (whether in warranty, contract, tort (including
negligence or strict liability) or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 3.8 serves to modify or qualify the representations of the Company contained in Article II or
the right of Parent and Merger Sub to rely thereon.

        Section 3.9    Financing.     

                (a)   Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of (i) the duly executed amended and restated commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement Date, from
the Financing Sources (together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and attachments thereto, the "Debt Commitment Letter" and together with the Redacted Fee Letter, the "Debt Commitment
Papers") and the Redacted Fee Letter, pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Financing Sources have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent
and Merger Sub for the purpose of funding the Transactions (the "Debt Financing"), and (ii) the duly executed amended and restated equity commitment letter, dated as of the Agreement Date
(as amended, restated, supplemented, modified or waived, the "Equity Commitment Letter" and, together with the Debt Commitment Papers, the "Financing Commitments") from certain funds
affiliated with Siris Capital Group, LLC ("Sponsor") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Sponsor has caused such funds to commit to invest the amounts set
forth therein solely for the purpose of funding the Transactions (the "Equity Financing" and, together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and

continue to provide until such time as this Agreement is terminated, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof to the extent set forth therein.

                (b)   As of the Agreement Date, each of the Financing Commitments (and each of the respective obligations and commitments contained therein) is in full force and effect and, has
not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, and, to Parent's Knowledge, no such withdrawal, termination,
rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is presently contemplated (other than amendments, modifications or terminations that are permitted by Section 4.15). Assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by each other party thereto, each of the Financing Commitments is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Merger Sub and Parent and (in the case of the
Debt Commitment Papers only, to the Knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent), the other parties thereto, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles. Except for the Financing Commitments in the form delivered pursuant
to Section 3.9(a) and the Redacted Fee Letter, as of the Agreement Date, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the Financing or the Financing
Commitments that could affect the conditionality or availability of the Financing, to which Merger Sub, Parent, Sponsor or any of their respective Affiliates is a party. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.3, the accuracy of the representations and warranties in Article II in all material respects, the compliance and performance by the
Company of its covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement in all material respects, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, as of the Agreement Date, (i) no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to (w) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing
Commitments inaccurate in any material respect, (x) constitute a default or breach on the part of Merger Sub, Parent or Sponsor and (in the case of the Debt Commitment Papers only, to the
Knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent) any of the other parties thereto, under any term of the Financing Commitment, (y) result in a failure of any condition of the Financing Commitments or
otherwise cause the Financing Commitments to be ineffective, or (z) result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to not be available at the Closing in an amount equal to the
Required Amount. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.3, the accuracy of the representations and warranties in Article II in all material respects, and the
compliance and performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement in all material respects, none of Merger Sub, Parent or Sponsor has any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that any of Merger Sub, Parent or Sponsor will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be
satisfied by it in any of the Financing Commitments on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) none of Merger Sub, Parent or Sponsor has any reason to believe that the full amount of the Financing
will not be available to Merger Sub on the date of the Closing and (iv) none of Merger Sub, Parent or Sponsor have Knowledge that any of the Financing Sources will not perform their
respective obligations under the Financing Commitments or of any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions or statements set forth in the Financing Commitments
inaccurate in any material respect.

                (c)   Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance with the applicable Financing Commitments and (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's obligation to consummate
the Merger (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing), the aggregate net proceeds of the Financing (including after giving effect to the maximum amount of
flex, including original issue discount flex, contemplated by the Debt Commitment Papers), when combined with Parent's and Merger Sub's other sources of funds, will be sufficient for the
satisfaction of all of Merger Sub's and Parent's obligations under this Agreement to be satisfied at or after Closing on the terms contemplated hereby and under the Financing Commitments,
including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8, amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 1.6, the payment of all associated fees, costs and expenses and all
other amounts, in each case, required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub at Closing pursuant to this Agreement, with respect to Merger and the Financing or the Transactions,

including any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries required in connection therewith and giving effect to the maximum amount of flex,
including original issue discount flex, contemplated by the Debt Commitment Papers (the "Required Amount"). There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding
or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing in an amount equal to the Required Amount or that would permit the parties thereunder to reduce the total amount of the
Financing to an amount less than the Required Amount, in each case other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. Each of Merger Sub and Parent have paid in full any and
all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments on or before the Agreement Date.

                (d)   Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement (including the payment by Parent and Merger Sub of the Required Amount)
that Parent or Merger Sub obtains Debt Financing (including, without limitation, as contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter for or related to any of the transactions contemplated herein,
but acknowledging that the Company's right to specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded under the Equity Commitment Letter is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 7.6(a) ).

        Section 3.10    Limited Guarantee.     Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the Limited Guarantee duly executed by the Guarantors
with respect to certain matters on the terms specified therein. The Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantors
(except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles), and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of a Guarantor
under such Limited Guarantee.

        Section 3.11    Solvency.     Neither Merger Sub nor Parent is entering into this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company
and/or the Company Subsidiaries. Assuming the satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, and after
giving effect to the Transactions, and payment of the Required Amount, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of and after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Solvent" means that, as of any date of determination and with respect to any Person: (a) the fair value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater
than the total amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (b) the present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person
and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on their
debts and liabilities as they become absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are not engaged in business or a transaction, and are not about to engage
in business or a transaction, for which such Person's and its Subsidiaries' assets, on a consolidated basis, would constitute unreasonably small capital, and (d) such Person and its Subsidiaries,
on a consolidated basis, do not intend to, and do not believe that they will, incur debts or liabilities beyond their ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature; provided, however, for
the purposes hereof, the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the
amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability (irrespective of whether such contingent liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 5).

        Section 3.12    Ownership of Company Common Stock.     None of Merger Sub or Parent or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at any time during the last three (3) years has
been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. No material amount of shares of Company Common Stock or securities that are convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable into shares of Company Common Stock are owned (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) by Sponsor, Parent or

Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company and to hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Definitive Proxy Date and

Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have made a Change in Company Board Recommendation as permitted by Section 4.5.

                (b)   The Company agrees that its obligation to hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or by the making of any Change in Company Board Recommendation by the Company Board, and nothing
contained herein, other than the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation, subject to the ability of the Company
Board to take the actions set forth in Section 4.5(f); provided, however, that if, the Company Board shall have effected a Change in Company Board Recommendation pursuant to, and in

Company Stockholders Meeting is then-scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; (ii) if on

business of the Company Stockholders Meeting; (iii) if the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting by applicable Law, order of Governmental Authority or a

applicable Law or (v) if there has been a Change in Company Board Recommendation and the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders' Meeting in order to give the stockholders of the Company sufficient time to evaluate

such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (ii) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, failure to take any of the
following actions would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may: (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the

Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, when mailed; (C) make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than an unequivocal
recommendation against such offer or a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act in which
the Company Board or the Company indicates that the Company Board has not changed the Company Board Recommendation; (D) if reasonably requested in writing by Parent in a timely

                        (i)    effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to a material fact, event, change or development that (a) arises after the Agreement Date and was not
known to the Company Board as of or prior to the Agreement Date and (b) does not involve or relate to an Acquisition Proposal, if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

                        (ii)   effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with
the Company's financial advisor, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and

                        (iii)  terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii) (and, if applicable, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement), if the Company receives an Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to enter into such definitive agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

                (g)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4.5(f), the Company shall not be entitled to: (i) make a Change in Company Board Recommendation pursuant to
Section 4.5(f)(i) or Section 4.5(f)(ii); or (ii) terminate this Agreement (and, if applicable, enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement) pursuant to Section 4.5(f)(iii), unless in all such
instances: (A) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent (it being understood and agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a
Change in Company Board Recommendation) that the Company is prepared to (x) make a Change in Company Board Recommendation (a "Recommendation Change Notice"), or
(y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii) in response to a Superior Proposal (a "Superior Proposal Notice"), which notice shall contain a description of the reasons for such
Change in Company Board Recommendation or, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is a Superior Proposal, contain a description of the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, including a copy of the Company Acquisition Agreement in the form to be entered into; (B) after providing such notice, the Company shall have negotiated, and shall
have caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during the period commencing at delivery of such
notice and ending one (1) Business Day after the receipt of such notice (it being understood that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notification pursuant to the foregoing clause (A) and a new period of negotiation under this clause (B) of one (1) Business Day), to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee as would permit the Company Board to determine that the
Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (C) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter,
the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee that may be offered in writing by Parent no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York Time) on the last day of such one (1) Business Day

failure to effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any material changes with respect to events, facts and
circumstances mentioned above, or material changes to the financial terms of such Superior Proposal, as the case may be, occurring prior to the Company's effecting a Change in Company
Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii) shall require the Company to provide to Parent a new Recommendation Change Notice or Superior
Proposal Notice and a new one (1) Business Day period.

Rule 14e-2(a) and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders to comply with applicable Law (it being
agreed that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or a factually accurate public
statement by the Company that describes the Company's receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed to be a Change in
Company Board Recommendation); provided, that any such action taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a customary "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation unless the Company Board
reaffirms the Company Recommendation within four (4) Business Days following any request by Parent for such reaffirmation (it being agreed that Parent may make only one (1) such request
with respect to any single such disclosure).

        Section 4.6    Consents; Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts.     

                (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the limitations set forth in Section 4.5), the parties hereto will use their respective commercially reasonable best

be made, in cooperation with the other parties hereto and to the extent applicable, all necessary filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations and notices with Governmental
Authorities under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger. Each party shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to: (A) respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for
additional information made by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, or any other Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger; (B) act in
good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with any investigation by any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger; (C) furnish to
each other all information required for any filing, form, declaration, notification, registration and notice under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger, subject to advice of such party's
antitrust counsel (excluding any documents and communications which are subject to preexisting confidentiality agreements, the attorney client privilege or work product doctrine or required
by applicable Law or Order or by applicable Governmental Authority not to be so disclosed); and (D) take all other actions reasonably necessary consistent with this Section 4.6 to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law relating to the Merger. In connection with the foregoing, except as prohibited by
applicable Law or Order or by applicable Governmental Authority, each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts: (w) to give the other party reasonable prior notice of
any communication with, and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Authority regarding any investigations, proceedings, filings, forms, declarations, notifications,
registrations or notices, and permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed communication,

inquiry under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger, without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the
opportunity to attend and/or participate therein; (y) if attending a meeting, conference, or conversation with a Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger, from
which the other party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority from participating in or attending, to keep the other reasonably apprised with respect
thereto; and (z) to consult and cooperate with the other party in connection with any information or proposals submitted in connection with any proceeding, inquiry, or other proceeding under
any Antitrust Law relating to the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its commercially reasonable best efforts: (1) to avoid the entry of any
Governmental Order; and (2) to eliminate every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority so as to enable the Effective Time to occur as soon
as reasonably possible (and in any event, not later than the Outside Date). Any fees and expenses (other than the attorney's, advisor's and agent's fees) payable under the filings, registrations
and declarations with Governmental Authorities relating to the Transactions shall be borne equally by the Company and Parent (and each of the Company and Parent shall make such equal
payment on the date that such filing is made).

                (b)   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Merger Sub, Parent and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions, including using commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain and
maintain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from all Governmental Authorities or other third parties and make all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings with all Governmental Authorities or other third parties that are necessary to consummate the Merger.

                (c)   For purposes of Section 4.6(a), "commercially reasonable best efforts" shall include (I) contesting and resisting any Legal Proceeding, and to seek to cause to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any Governmental Order that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Transactions under any applicable Law; (II) the obligations of the Company
under this Section 4.6 shall not require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to incur any financial obligations prior to the Effective Time, except for the fees and expenses of counsel or as
provided in last sentence of Section 4.6(a) and (III) the obligation by Parent, Merger Sub, and any of their Subsidiaries to offer and consent to, and thereafter to implement, any of the following
measures if doing so would enable the parties to avoid, resolve, or lift a Governmental Order or Legal Proceeding or to obtain any Governmental Approval: (i) make any payment to any
Governmental Authority as required by applicable Law or the terms of any governmental grant, authorization or permit, (ii) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of any assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (iii) conduct, restrict, operate,
invest or otherwise change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries in any manner, or

respective Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take or cause to be taken any action that it is aware or reasonably should be aware would have the effect of delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any Governmental Approvals.

                (d)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing will be governed exclusively by
Section 4.15 and not this Section 4.6.

the views of the other party, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement with respect to any matters which are not addressed in the Press Release prior to such

Company Subsidiaries and their respective successors for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, regarding elimination of liability of the Company Indemnified Parties, indemnification,
exculpation, contribution and advancement of expenses, provisions that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the Agreement
Date contained in the Company Charter Documents; provided, however, all rights to indemnification in respect of any actual or threatened Legal Proceeding made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such Legal Proceeding or resolution of such Legal Proceeding.

                (c)   If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporations or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then and in
each such case, Parent shall cause the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation to assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 4.8 as a condition to consummating any such
consolidation, merger or transfer or properties or assets.

                (d)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the premiums for a non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the
Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the "D&O Insurance"), in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of up to six (6) years on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the indemnified parties, or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 4.8, as
applicable, than the existing directors' and officers' liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company, with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time from the Company's current D&O Insurance carriers or one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current D&O Insurance carriers.
Merger Sub and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such "tail" prepaid policy in full force and effect for six (6) years after the Closing; provided, however that (y) in no
event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation be required or permitted to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an aggregate amount in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the Agreement Date in respect of such coverage, and (z) if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount and the Company
or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall obtain a policy in accordance with this sentence, such policy shall provide the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

                (e)   Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to assume, honor and fulfill all obligations of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries pursuant to any written indemnification agreements with the indemnified parties, or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section 4.8, as applicable.

                (f)    The provisions of this Section 4.8 shall survive consummation of the Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured person
hereunder (including the Company Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives (who shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be deemed third-party beneficiaries of this
Agreement for purposes of this Section 4.8) and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract, at
Law or otherwise.

(i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Papers until the Transactions are consummated, (ii) enforce (including through specific performance, litigation or other appropriate proceedings,
each of the foregoing pursued in good faith) its rights under the Debt Commitment Papers, (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
(including flex provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment Papers (or on terms not materially less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than the terms and conditions (including flex
provisions) in the Financing Commitments), and (iv) satisfy, or cause their Representatives to satisfy, on or prior to the Closing Date (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions in the Debt
Commitment Papers and such definitive agreements applicable to it that are within its control. In the event that all the conditions contained in any Financing Commitment (other than, with

reasonable best efforts (including through litigation pursued in good faith) to cause the Financing Sources party to the Debt Financing Papers to, and shall cause the Financing Sources party to
the Equity Commitment Letter to, comply with their respective obligations, including to fund the Financing at the Closing (and in any event prior to the Outside Date). Each of Merger Sub and

Commitments or Financing Agreements without the prior written consent of the Company (which may be granted or withheld in the Company's sole discretion), to the extent such
amendments, modifications or waivers could or could reasonably be expected to (i) reduce (or have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of aggregate cash proceeds available from the
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount) unless (but only to the extent that) Parent and Merger Sub do not require the full amount of the
Financing to fund the Required Amount at the Closing or Parent delivers the Company an amended Equity Commitment Letter, duly executed by the affiliates of the Sponsor listed therein, to
increase the Equity Financing by an amount equal to such reduction to such Financing; provided, however, that no Financing Commitment shall be reduced unless and until such financing is

Closing or the Company receives such amended Equity Commitment Letter, or (ii) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any
of the conditions precedent to the Financing in a manner that could reasonably be expected to be adverse to Merger Sub, Parent or the Company, including any expansion, amendment or
modification that would or could be reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or delay or impair the ability of Merger Sub and Parent to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions to be
consummated on the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement, (B) adversely impact the ability of Merger Sub or Parent to enforce its rights or remedies against the other parties to the
Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements or (C) make the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date or satisfaction of the conditions precedent to obtaining the Financing on the
Closing Date any less likely to occur; provided that, subject to compliance with the other provisions of this Section 4.15, Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to
add arrangers, bookrunners, agents or similar entities if such modifications, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay or impair the ability of
Merger Sub and Parent to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated on the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, to
modify pricing or implement or exercise any of the flex provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Papers. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment,
modification or waiver of any of the Financing Commitments or the Financing Agreements. Neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the
lenders and other Persons under the Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements, except for (i) replacements of the Debt Commitment Letter with alternative financing commitments
pursuant to Section 4.15(c) , or (ii) assignments and replacements of lenders under the terms of the syndication of the Financing Commitments in accordance with the terms thereof so long as
any such assignment or replacement would, were it structured as an amendment to the existing Financing Commitment, not result in any of the circumstances described in the first sentence of
this Section 4.15(b).

                (c)   In the event that any portion of the Financing (A) becomes or (B) would reasonably be expected to become unavailable in the manner contemplated in the Financing
Commitments (including the flex provisions) (other than as a result of the termination of the Financing Commitments on the Outside Date pursuant to the terms thereof), Parent shall promptly
so notify the Company. As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in the immediately preceding sentence or in Section 4.15(d)(ii); provided, however, subject to the rules of discovery otherwise applicable, that Parent or Merger Sub need not provide any
information that it believes after consultation with external legal counsel to be privileged. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to the second preceding sentence or in
Section 4.15(d)(ii), Merger Sub and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to, alternative financing from the same or alternative financial institutions or other Persons (which such alternative financing (x) shall be in an amount, when combined with
Merger Sub's and Parent's other source of funds, equal to the Required Amount on terms (unless otherwise agreed by Parent) and conditions that are not materially less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Merger Sub and Parent than those in the Financing Commitments (including flex provisions) as in effect on the Agreement Date and (y) shall not contain any terms that would not
be permitted to be effected by an amendment, modification or waiver of the Financing Commitments pursuant to Section 4.15(b)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in no event shall the "reasonable best efforts" of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or be construed to require Parent or Merger Sub to, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to,
seek equity financing from any source other than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter. The definitive agreements entered
into pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 4.15(c) or Section 4.15(a)(iii) are referred to in this Agreement, collectively, as the "Financing Agreements." In the event any new Financing
Commitment is obtained as permitted or required in accordance herewith, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing," the "Equity Financing" or the "Debt Financing" means the

the performance by any party to any Financing Commitment of its obligations thereunder nor the completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Financing (or any alternative
Financing) is a condition to Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the Transactions irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any alternative

Letters) promptly upon their execution, but in any event on the same day as the execution thereof, (ii) without limiting the generality of the immediately following subclause (iii), give the

commitment, the Financing Agreements, or any alternative financing agreement entered into in accordance with this Section 4.15 or any termination thereof or attempted or threatened
termination thereof (in each case, whether or not such attempted or threatened termination is valid), (B) if Parent or Merger Sub obtains Knowledge that any of the Financing Commitments
ceases to be in full force and effect and the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent or Merger Sub or of the other parties thereto, (C) if Parent or Merger Sub or any of their

amount equal to the Required Amount at Closing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments, provided, however, subject to the rules of discovery otherwise
applicable, that Parent or Merger Sub need not provide any information that is privileged if Parent shall have used its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the
applicable information in a way that would not violate the applicable rule or risk waiver of such privilege), and (iii) otherwise, promptly upon request of the Company, keep the Company
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or any alternative financing under this Section 4.15).

cause its Subsidiaries to, cause (i) to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by a Continuing Employee under any Company benefit plan as of the Closing and (ii) any deductible, co-

                (e)   All payments under this Section 6.3 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the party to whom payment is owed.

                (f)    Subject to Section 6.2, Section 7.6 and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates that, in the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which the Company Termination Fee would be payable by the Company, its receipt of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 6.3(b) or Section 6.3(c), shall, except in the case of Fraud or Willful Breach, (x) be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all Damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, each of their Affiliates and Representatives and any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and such termination hereof), the Transactions (and such
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter arising out of or relating to such termination; and (y) none of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding against the Company or its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions (or such
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters arising out of or relating to such termination of this Agreement if the Company Termination Fee is paid or a claim for any such Damages in
such case. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 6.2 and Section 7.6 and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges
and agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that the rights of Parent and Merger Sub, if any, to (x) prior to any termination of this Agreement, obtain injunctive relief pursuant to Section 7.6
or seek Damages in respect of any breach of this Agreement, (y) following the termination of this Agreement, seek Damages as set forth in Section 6.2, and (z) following the termination of this
Agreement, receive the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 6.3(b) or Section 6.3(c) constitute the sole and exclusive remedies (whether at law, in equity, in contract, tort or
otherwise) of Parent, Merger Sub and each of their Affiliates and Representatives for any and all Damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, each of their Affiliates and
Representatives and any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and such termination hereof), the Transactions (and such abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming
the basis for such termination. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion or, in circumstances in
which the Company Termination Fee is paid, have any aggregate liability under this Agreement in excess of the amount of the Company Termination Fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and the Company
Termination Fee.

                (g)   Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 6.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the fee due pursuant to
Section 6.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company commences litigation that results in an award against the other party for such fee, the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, shall pay to the other party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such litigation, together with interest on the amount of the
applicable fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

                (h)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company agrees and acknowledges that, except as expressly permitted by Section 7.6, if Parent and
Merger Sub fail to effect the Merger or otherwise are in breach of this Agreement, then (i) the Company's sole and exclusive remedy against Parent, Merger Sub, any debt or equity financing
source, any Guarantor, or any of their respective Affiliates and any of their respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees or Representatives (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties"), whether at law or equity, in

pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Limited Guarantee and (D) the parties to the Equity Commitment Letter for specific performance of their respective obligations under the Equity

Company be (x) entitled to collect the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion (or, after the receipt thereof, any portion thereof or any further funds or amounts) or (y) permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance as contemplated by Section 7.6 and any money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee. The Company
further agrees that in the event of termination of this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub and all of the other Parent Related Parties, taken as a whole, shall be
limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee and the Additional Amounts and in no event shall the Company seek to recover, or be entitled to recover, any Damages
of any kind, character or description in excess of such amount, except that such limitation of liability shall in no event or circumstance apply to any Additional Amounts that may be due or
payable by any Parent Related Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including for such purposes the Limited Guarantee or the Confidentiality Agreement). In no event shall the
Company seek to recover, or be entitled to recover, monetary damages from any Parent Related Party, other than Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement or the Guarantors under the
Limited Guarantee. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, institute any proceeding or bring any other claim arising
under, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the Limited Guarantee or the negotiation, execution, performance, abandonment or termination of the Transactions

Parent Related Party except for claims: (i) against Parent and/or Merger Sub in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (ii) against Parent and/or Merger Sub for
indemnification or expense reimbursement under Section 4.16, (iii) against the Guarantors under the Limited Guarantee, subject to the terms and limitations thereof; (iv) against the parties to
the Equity Commitment Letter for specific performance of their respective obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, subject to the terms and limitations thereof if, and the terms set
forth in Section 7.6(a) (in case of the foregoing, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied (or waived); and (v) against Siris Capital
Group, LLC under the Confidentiality Agreement, subject to the terms and limitations thereof (the claims described in clauses (i) through (v) collectively, the "Retained Claims").
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf of itself and each of its current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees and Representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source or any of its Affiliates and
any of their respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners,
assignees or Representatives (collectively, including the Financing Sources, the "Debt Financing Source Related Parties") in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the Debt

dispute, suit, claim, litigation, investigation, proceeding or other action against any Debt Financing Source Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the Debt
Commitment Letters. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is agreed that no Debt Financing Source Related Party shall have any liability for any claims, losses,
settlements, damages, costs, expenses, fines or penalties to the Company (or any of its current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, agents, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners, assignees and Representatives) in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 6.3(h) shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub (nor, following the Closing Date, the Company as the Surviving Corporation) under the Debt

ARTICLE VII
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

        Section 7.1    Amendment or Supplement.     At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, by written agreement signed
by all of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Financing Sources Provisions (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the substance of any Financing Sources Provisions) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that
impacts or is adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

        Section 7.2    Extension of Time, Waiver, etc.     At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law: (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party hereto; provided, however, that after adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock (if applicable), no waiver shall be made which would
pursuant to applicable Law require further approval by such holders without obtaining such further approval; (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any
other party hereto; or (c) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained in this Agreement or, except as otherwise
provided in the Agreement, waive any of such party's conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Merger Sub or Parent in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver of rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such rights preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

        Section 7.3    No Additional Representations; No Survival.     To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent, their respective Affiliates or
their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders, controlling Persons or Representatives shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to any other party hereto, its Affiliates or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, stockholders, controlling Persons or Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any
information provided or made available, or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to such party, its Affiliates or any of their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders, controlling Persons
or Representatives, including in respect of the specific representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article II of this Agreement and in respect of the specific representations and
warranties of Merger Sub and Parent set forth in Article III of this Agreement, except as and only to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement with respect to such representations and
warranties, subject to the limitations and restrictions contained in this Agreement. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Effective Date or the termination of this Agreement. This Section 7.3 shall not

this Agreement.

        Section 7.4    Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary.     

                (a)   This Agreement, including the exhibits and annexes hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedules, the Parent Disclosure Schedules, the Limited Guarantee, the Equity
Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letter, the documents and instruments relating to the Merger referred to in this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement is not
intended, and shall not be deemed, to create any agreement of employment with any person, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto, except (i) the directors and officers of the Company (with respect to matters covered by Section 4.8
and this Section 7.4), (ii) the Financing Sources (with respect to the Financing Sources Provisions), and (iii) the Parent Related Parties (with respect to Section 6.3(h)).

                (b)   The inclusion of information in the Company Disclosure Schedules will not be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that a violation, right of termination,
default, liability or other obligation of any kind exists with respect to any item, nor will it be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that such information is material to the
Company. In addition, matters reflected in the Company Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Company Disclosure
Schedules (including the listing of items on any Company Disclosure Schedules although such items may not necessarily be required to be included in such Company Disclosure Schedules
because of the dollar thresholds set forth in this Agreement). Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar
nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Company
Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Person will use the fact of the
setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in the Company Disclosure Schedules is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Further, neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or
are not in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and no Person will use the fact of setting forth or the inclusion of any such items or matter in any dispute or controversy
between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Schedules is or is not in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice for purposes of this Agreement.

        Section 7.5    Applicable Law; Jurisdiction.     

                (a)   Subject to Section 7.12, this Agreement and all actions (whether at Law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, validity or
performance of this Agreement or the Merger shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction. Subject, in each case, to the terms of this
Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or in
equity. Subject, in each case, to the terms of this Agreement, the exercise by a party to this Agreement of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, AND EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS,

DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND

        Section 7.6    Specific Enforcement.     

                (a)   Subject to the remainder of this Section 7.6, the parties agree that irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or are otherwise breached, and, at the non-breaching party's election, such non-breaching
party shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in the courts chosen in Section 7.5(b). Each party hereby waives any requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection with the obtaining
of any injunctive relief or specific performance. This right to injunctive relief and specific performance is in addition to any other remedy to which the parties to this Agreement are entitled at
law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is acknowledged and agreed that Parent has an obligation hereunder to cause the Equity Financing to be funded,
including by exercising its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, and the parties hereto further agree that the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of
specific performance or equitable relief, in each case, solely with respect to causing Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity Commitment Letter) shall be subject to the requirements that:

                        (i)    with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the Closing, all the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 and Section 5.3 would have been satisfied (or have
been waived by Parent) if the Closing were to have occurred at such time (other than those conditions that by their terms

are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the time that the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be
funded);

                        (ii)   the Debt Financing (or, in the case alternative debt financing has been obtained in accordance with Section 4.15(c) for all the Debt Financing, such alternative debt
financing) has been funded or would be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing, if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing;

                        (iii)  Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, and

                        (iv)  the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that (A) all conditions in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 have been satisfied or that it is willing to waive any such
open conditions, and (B) if specific performance is granted and if the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing were funded, the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the
Merger.

                (b)   For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event shall the exercise of the Company's right to seek specific performance or other equitable relief pursuant to this Section 7.6 reduce,
restrict or otherwise limit the Company's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and be paid the Parent Termination Fee (provided, that under no circumstances
shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the Merger occurring pursuant to this Section 7.6 and the payment of all or any portion
of the Parent Termination Fee) plus any Additional Amounts and (ii) the Company's right to seek specific performance pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall include the right of the Company to
cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to fully enforce the terms of the Debt Financing Papers, including by requiring Parent and/or Merger Sub to file one or more lawsuits against any party to the
Debt Financing Papers to fully enforce the obligations of such party therein. Subject to Section 7.6(a), each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity.

        Section 7.7    Assignment.     Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether by
operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that
Parent and Merger Sub may assign, in their sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries of Parent, effective with the Effective Date, or as collateral to the applicable Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing without the consent of the Company,
but no such assignment shall relieve any assignor of any of its respective liabilities or obligations under this Agreement in the event its obligations are not performed. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Stock") will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest (the "Consideration"). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Web Common Stock of the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger.

        In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:

(ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of Web furnished to or discussed with us by the management

(x) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as we deemed appropriate.

        In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly
available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and have relied upon the assurances of the management of Web that it is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the Web Forecasts and the NOLs, we have been advised by Web, and we have assumed,
that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Web as to the future financial performance of
Web and the other matters covered thereby. We have relied, at the direction of Web, upon the assessments of the management of Web as to the potential impact of market, governmental and
regulatory trends and developments relating to or affecting Web and its business. We have also relied, at the direction of Web, on the assessments of the management of Web as to the ability to
utilize the NOLs and have been advised by Web, and have assumed, at the direction of Web, that such NOLs will be utilized in the amounts and at the times projected. We have not made or
been provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Web, Parker or any other entity, nor have we made any physical inspection of
the properties or assets of Web, Parker or any other entity. We have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of Web, Parker or any other entity under any state, federal or other laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We have assumed, at the direction of Web, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or
amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the
Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Web or the
contemplated benefits of the Merger.

        We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the Merger (other than the Consideration to the extent expressly specified herein), including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, any related transactions or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or related to the Merger or
otherwise. As you are aware, we were not requested to solicit, and since 2017 we have not solicited, indications of interest or proposals from third parties regarding a possible acquisition of all
or any part of Web or any alternative transaction. We note, however, that the Agreement permits Web to authorize us, during a specified period of time following the execution of the
Agreement, to solicit on Web's behalf indications of interest or proposals from third parties with respect to the possible acquisition of all or any part of Web. Our opinion is limited to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be received by holders of Web Common Stock and no opinion or view is expressed with respect to any consideration received in

(financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons,
relative to the Consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view is expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be
available to Web or in which Web might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Web to proceed with or effect the Merger. We also are not expressing any view or opinion with
respect to, and we have relied, at the direction of Web, upon the assessments of representatives of Web regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to Web or the
Merger, as to which matters we understand that Web obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, we express no opinion or recommendation as to
how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any other matter.

ANNEX C 

June 20, 2018

The Board of Directors Web.com Group, Inc.
12808 Gran Bay Parkway West
Jacksonville, Florida 32258

Members of the Board of Directors:

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Company Common Stock"), of
Web.com Group, Inc. (the "Company") of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the "Transaction") of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parker
Private Holdings 11, LLC (the "Acquiror"). Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 20, 2018 (the "Agreement"), among the Company, the Acquiror and its subsidiary,
Parker Private Merger Sub, Inc. ("Acquisition Sub"), the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other
than (i) shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company, Acquiror or Acquisition Sub or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of either the Company or the Acquiror, and
(ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 per share in cash (the "Consideration").

        In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed the Agreement; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning the Company and
the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we
deemed relevant and the consideration paid for such companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain
other companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded securities of such other companies;
(v) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of the Company relating to its business; and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses
and considered such other information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.

        In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to certain aspects of the Transaction, and the past and current business
operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our inquiry.

        In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished to or discussed with us by the
Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to our engagement letter with the
Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities,
nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. In relying on financial analyses and
forecasts provided to us or derived therefrom, we have assumed that they

have been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. We have also
assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated as described in the Agreement. We have also assumed that the representations
and warranties made by the Company, the Acquiror and Acquisition Sub in the Agreement and the related agreements are and will be true and correct in all respects material to our analysis.
We are not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the Company with respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or on the
contemplated benefits of the Transaction.

        Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood . that
subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point
of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration to be paid
in connection with the Transaction to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage in
the Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or employees of any party to the Transaction, or any
class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation.

        We note that we were not authorized to and did not solicit any expressions of interest from any other parties with respect to the sale of all or any part of the Company or any other
alternative transaction.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee from the Company for our services, a substantial portion of which will
become payable only if the proposed Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two
years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial or investment banking relationships with the Company, for which we and such affiliates have received
customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as lead arranger and bookrunner on the Company's facilities which closed in April 2018, and joint lead
arranger and joint bookrunner on the Company's facilities which closed in May 2017. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding credit
facilities of the Company, for which it receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 2% of the
outstanding common stock of the Company. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial instruments (including
derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or the Acquiror for our own account or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short
positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

        On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common Stock in the proposed
Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This letter is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company (in its
capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how
such stockholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other matter. This opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated

ANNEX D 

Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law 

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares,
who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in
favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the
stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a
corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a
merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of
stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon
the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no
appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of
the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation
if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such
stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository
receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing
paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately
prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by
§ 363(b) of this title, and

the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the
words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an
amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as
nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation,
not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in
accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for
any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy
of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or
consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and
that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the
surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the
merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the
merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation
who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such
constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such
notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later
of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder
intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such
constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all
such holders on or

within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger
approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first
notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this
subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the
absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix,
in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the
day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of
the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof,
upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not
voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement
shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation
the statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such
service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for
their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting
corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of
such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by
1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court
deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may
require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit

their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court
may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which
appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights
unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the
merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any
rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the
Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum
of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon
application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal
prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment
shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the
corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting
corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the
Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees
and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to
vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which
is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if
such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation,
either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or

consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or
joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation
shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
