Rackspace Hosting, Inc.
1 Fanatical Place

San Antonio, TX 78218
September 30, 2016

Dear Rackspace Stockholder:

        You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders (which we refer to as the "special meeting") of Rackspace
Hosting, Inc. (which we refer to as "Rackspace") to be held on Wednesday, November 2, 2016, at Rackspace's Corporate Headquarters,
1 Fanatical Place, San Antonio, TX 78218, at 8:30 a.m., Central time.

        At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
August 26, 2016, as it may be amended from time to time (which we refer to as the "merger agreement"), by and among Rackspace,
Inception Parent, Inc. (which we refer to as "Parent") and Inception Merger Sub, Inc. We refer to the acquisition of Rackspace by Parent as
the "merger." At the special meeting, you will also be asked to consider and vote on proposals (1) for the adjournment of the special
meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting; (2) to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable by Rackspace to its named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) to approve the acceleration of vesting of
certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

        If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $32.00 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding
taxes, for each share of common stock that you own (unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights), which represents a
premium of approximately 38.2% over the closing price of Rackspace's common stock on August 3, 2016, the last trading day prior to
news reports speculating that Rackspace was the subject of a potential acquisition transaction.

        Rackspace's Board of Directors, after considering the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, has
unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Rackspace and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the
merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Rackspace's Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement;
(2) "FOR" the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies
if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; (3) "FOR" the compensation that
will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (4) "FOR" the
acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

        The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the special meeting, the merger agreement and the merger. A copy
of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.

        This proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of Rackspace's Board of Directors in connection with its
evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger. We encourage you

to read this proxy statement and its annexes, including the merger agreement, carefully and in their entirety, as they contain important
information.

        Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person, please sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. If you attend
the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy that you have previously submitted. If you fail to return
your proxy or to attend the special meeting in person, your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present at the special meeting and will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement.

        If you hold your shares in "street name," you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other
nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals to be considered at the special meeting without your instructions.

        Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. We cannot complete the merger unless the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common
stock entitled to vote on the proposal.

        If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares, please contact our proxy solicitor:

that we refer to in this proxy statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without
charge by following the instructions in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Where You Can Find More Information." A

dated as of August 26, 2016, as it may be amended from time to time, by and among Rackspace, Parent and Merger Sub, as the

Table of Contents

Inception Merger Sub, Inc.

        Merger Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and was formed on July 21, 2016, solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Merger Sub has not engaged in any business activities other than in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Merger Sub's principal executive offices are located at 9 West
57th Street, 43rd Floor, New York, NY 10019, and its telephone number is (212) 515-3200.

Effect of the Merger 

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time
of the merger, (1) Merger Sub will merge with and into Rackspace; (2) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease;
and (3) Rackspace will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Throughout
this proxy statement, we use the term "surviving corporation" to refer to Rackspace as the surviving corporation following the
merger.

        As a result of the merger, Rackspace will cease to be a publicly traded company. If the merger is completed, you will not own
any shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.

        The time at which the merger becomes effective (which we refer to as the "effective time of the merger") will occur upon the
filing of a certificate of merger with and acceptance of that certificate by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later
time as Rackspace, Parent and Merger Sub may agree and specify in such certificate of merger).

Effect on Rackspace if the Merger is Not Completed 

        If the merger agreement is not adopted by Rackspace stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason,
Rackspace stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead,
(1) Rackspace will remain an independent public company; (2) our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the
NYSE and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the "Exchange Act"); and
(3) we will continue to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the "SEC").

Per Share Merger Consideration 

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each outstanding share of common
stock (other than shares (1) held by Rackspace as treasury stock; (2) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; (3) owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Rackspace, Parent or Merger Sub; and (4) held by any Rackspace stockholder who has properly
made a demand for appraisal under Delaware law and has not effectively withdrawn, failed to perfect, waived or otherwise lost such
stockholder's right to appraisal with respect to such shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive
$32.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. We refer to this amount as the "per share merger
consideration."

        At or prior to the closing of the merger, a sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated payment agent to pay
the aggregate per share merger consideration. Once a Rackspace stockholder has provided the payment agent with his, her or its
stock certificates (or customary agent's message with respect to book-entry shares), letter of transmittal and the other items specified
by the payment agent, the payment agent will promptly pay the stockholder the per share merger consideration. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and
Exchange and Payment Procedures."

        After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration, but you will no longer
have any rights as a stockholder (except that Rackspace stockholders who properly and validly exercise and perfect, and do not
validly withdraw or subsequently lose, their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the "fair value" of their
shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by Delaware law (as described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned "The Merger—Appraisal Rights")).

The Special Meeting 

Date, Time and Place

        A special meeting of stockholders will be held on Wednesday, November 2, 2016, at Rackspace's Corporate Headquarters,
1 Fanatical Place, San Antonio, TX 78218, at 8:30 a.m., Central time. We refer to the special meeting, and any adjournment,
postponement or other delay of the special meeting, as the "special meeting."

Purpose

        At the special meeting, we will ask Rackspace stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement; (2) adjourn
the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement
at the time of the special meeting; (3) approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable
by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (4) approve the acceleration of vesting of certain
equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote

        You are entitled to vote at the special meeting if you owned shares of common stock as of the close of business on
September 28, 2016 (which we refer to as the "record date"). You will have one vote on each matter submitted for a vote at the
special meeting for each share of common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the record date.

Quorum

        As of the record date, there were 126,384,875 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding and entitled
to vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum at the special meeting. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted
at the special meeting.

Required Vote

        The proposals to be voted on at the special meeting require the following votes in order to be approved:

• Proposal 1: Approval of the adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. 

• Proposal 2: Approval of the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at
the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

• Proposal 3: Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable by
Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority
of the voting power of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting
and entitled to vote on the proposal. 

• Proposal 4: Approval of the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee
directors requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of common stock present in
person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. With respect to this
proposal only, we will not consider any shares of common stock that are beneficially owned by a director or
executive officer of Rackspace to be entitled to vote on the proposal.

Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers

        As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned, and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
20,168,261 shares of common stock, representing approximately 16% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the record
date. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote all of their shares of common stock (1) "FOR"
the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) "FOR" the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special
meeting; and (3) "FOR" the compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger.

        Graham Weston, our co-founder and chairman of the Rackspace Board, and certain affiliates of Mr. Weston, have entered into a
voting agreement with Parent and Merger Sub. We refer to this agreement as the "voting agreement." The voting agreement
obligates Mr. Weston and such affiliates to, among other things, vote their shares of common stock in favor of the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement. Mr. Weston and his affiliates own, in the aggregate, approximately 15% of our common stock. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Voting Agreement."

Voting and Proxies

        Any Rackspace stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may vote in one of the following ways: (1) by
proxy, by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope; (2) by granting a proxy
electronically over the internet or by telephone; or (3) in person by appearing at the special meeting and voting by ballot. If you are
a beneficial owner and hold your shares of common stock in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should
instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of common stock using the instructions provided
by your bank, broker or other nominee. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion
to vote on routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the special meeting are non-routine matters, and banks, brokers
and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you cast your
vote or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.

        If you are a Rackspace stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at
the special meeting by (1) signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it prior to the special meeting; (2) submitting a
new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; (3) delivering a written
notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or (4) attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.

        If you hold your shares of common stock in "street name," you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person by ballot at the special meeting if you obtain a "legal
proxy" from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

Recommendation of the Rackspace Board and Reasons for the Merger 

        The Rackspace Board, after considering various factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger
—Recommendation of the Rackspace Board and Reasons for the Merger," has unanimously (1) determined that the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best
interests of Rackspace and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        The Rackspace Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement;
(2) "FOR" the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; (3) "FOR" the
compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the
merger; and (4) "FOR" the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

Fairness Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co. 

        Goldman, Sachs & Co. (which we refer to as "Goldman Sachs"), financial advisor to Rackspace, delivered its opinion to the
Rackspace Board that, as of August 26, 2016, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the
$32.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 26, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to
this proxy statement. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the Rackspace Board in connection
with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of common stock
should vote with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or any other matter. The engagement letter between
Rackspace and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of
announcement, at approximately $25 million, approximately $500,000 of which was paid prior to the execution of the merger
agreement, and the remainder of which is contingent upon, and will be paid at, consummation of the merger.

        For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Fairness Opinion of Goldman
Sachs."

Treatment of Equity Awards in the Merger 

        The merger agreement provides that Rackspace's equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger will be treated as follows in the merger:

Company Options

        At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase shares of common stock (which we refer to as a "company option")

time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, will, be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to, the product obtained by multiplying (1) the per share merger consideration less the exercise price per share
attributable to such company option by (2) the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise in full of such
company option. We refer to this amount as the "option consideration." The payment of the option consideration will be subject to
any applicable withholding taxes.

        With respect to any company options, whether vested or unvested, for which the exercise price per share attributable to such
company options is equal to or greater than the per share merger consideration, such company options will be cancelled without any
cash payment being made in exchange for such cancellation.

Company Stock-Based Awards

        At the effective time of the merger, each right to receive shares of common stock or benefits measured in whole or in part by
the value of a number of shares of common stock (including performance shares, performance-based units, market stock units,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom units, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units and dividend equivalents, but
not including any 401(k) plan of Rackspace), other than a company option (which we refer to as a "company stock-based award")
outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, to the extent vested (which generally includes certain
company stock-based awards that are otherwise scheduled to vest by their terms on or before December 31, 2016, as discussed in
the following paragraph) and, if applicable, unexercised, will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to, the product obtained by multiplying (1) the per share merger consideration less the exercise price per
share, if any, attributable to such company stock-based award by (2) the total number of shares of common stock subject to such
company stock-based award. We refer to this amount as the "company stock-based award consideration." We refer to such treatment
of such company-based stock awards as the "vested stock-based award treatment." The payment of the company stock-based award
consideration will be subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

        At the effective time of the merger, each company stock-based award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, to the extent subject to vesting conditions based solely on continued employment or service to
Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries and, if applicable, unexercised (which we refer to as an "unvested time-vesting company stock-
based award"), will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the company
stock-based award consideration in respect of such unvested time-vesting company stock-based award, generally payable in semi-
annual installments following the effective time of the merger depending on the original vesting schedule of the corresponding
company stock-based award and the title (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of the holder of such award
(which treatment of unvested company stock-based awards we refer to as the "unvested stock-based award treatment") as follows:

Vice President and Below 

Unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards that are scheduled to vest by their terms on or before December 31, 2016,
generally will fully vest as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and will be subject to the vested stock-based
award treatment rather than the unvested stock-based award treatment.

        With respect to each company stock-based award the vesting of which is conditional in whole or in part on the achievement of
performance goals during a performance period that was still outstanding as of August 26, 2016, (which we refer to as a
"performance company stock-based award"), that was granted (1) after August 22, 2013, the applicable performance metrics shall
be deemed to have been satisfied as to 100% of the target number of shares of common stock subject to such performance company
stock-based award as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, regardless of when the performance period ends, with
each such performance company stock-based award granted (a) prior to December 1, 2015, subject to the vested stock-based award
treatment and (b) on or after December 1, 2015, subject to the unvested stock-based award treatment; and (2) on August 22, 2013,
such performance company stock-based award will be treated in accordance with its terms.

        The receipt of the company stock-based award consideration in respect of unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards
and unvested performance company stock-based awards, in each case, that are subject to the unvested stock-based award treatment
is generally subject to the recipient's continued employment following the effective time of the merger, except that any then-unpaid
portion of a recipient's company stock-based award consideration generally will become immediately payable if such recipient's
termination of employment (whenever occurring) is either (1) without "Cause," as defined in Rackspace's 2007 Long-Term
Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the "2007 LTIP"); or (2) for "Good Reason," as defined in either (a) the Senior Executive
Change of Control and Severance Plan (which we refer to as the "Severance Plan"), if the recipient is a participant in the Severance
Plan as of immediately prior to such employee's termination date; or (b) an effective employment agreement between such
employee and Rackspace, the surviving corporation or their affiliates in all other cases (for the avoidance of doubt, clause (2) shall
not apply to any employee who as of immediately prior to such employee's termination of employment is neither a participant in the
Severance Plan nor is party to an effective employment agreement that contains a definition of "Good Reason"). However, before
the effective time of the merger, Rackspace may provide different vesting terms for any employee that are no more favorable to
such employee than the terms described above. Any payments of stock-based award consideration in respect of unvested time-
vesting company stock-based awards and unvested performance company stock-based awards will be subject to any applicable
withholding taxes.

        Parent will not assume, substitute or convert any company stock-based award that is outstanding and, if applicable,
unexercised, as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and that is held by a non-employee member of the
Rackspace Board. Each company stock-based award that is outstanding, and, if applicable, unexercised, as of immediately prior to
the effective time and that is held by a non-employee member of the Rackspace Board will, subject to the approval of the Rackspace
stockholders (excluding, for this purpose, any shares of common stock beneficially held by such non-employee members of the
Rackspace Board) be fully vested as of immediately prior to the effective time and will be subject to the vested stock-based award
treatment.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Rackspace Board has adopted resolutions, and has amended the terms of
Rackspace's 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (which we refer to as the "ESPP") as necessary, (1) providing that each individual
participating in the Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) in progress on the date of the merger agreement (which we refer to as
the "final offering") will not be permitted to (a) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in
effect when that Purchase Period commenced; or (b) make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date
of the merger agreement, except as may be required by applicable law; (2) ensuring that, except for the final offering, no offering
period under the ESPP will be authorized or commenced on or after the date of the merger agreement; (3) if the closing of the
merger will occur prior to the end of the final offering, providing each individual participating in the final offering with notice of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement prior to the closing of the merger; (4) causing the final offering to end no later
than one business day prior to the closing of the merger; (5) making any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the
shortened final offering Purchase Period, but otherwise treat such shortened final offering Purchase Period as a fully effective and
completed Purchase Period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (6) causing each ESPP participant's accumulated contributions
under the ESPP to be used to purchase shares of common stock in accordance with the ESPP as of the end of the final offering;
(7) providing that the applicable purchase price for the common stock will not be decreased below the levels set forth in the ESPP
as of the date of the merger agreement; (8) ensuring that no further rights are granted under the ESPP after the effective time of the
merger; and (9) effective as of the effective time of the merger (but subject to the consummation of the merger), terminating the
ESPP.

Employee Benefits 

        From and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation
to) honor all of Rackspace's plans, programs, policies, practices, agreements, and arrangements (which we refer to collectively as
"Rackspace benefit plans") and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms. However, nothing will
prohibit the surviving corporation from amending or terminating any such Rackspace benefit plans or compensation or severance
arrangements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable law.

        For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) either (1) maintain for the benefit of each employee who is an
employee of Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and who continues to be an
employee of Parent or one of its subsidiaries (including the surviving corporation) immediately following the effective time of the
merger (which we refer to as a "continuing employee") the Rackspace benefit plans (other than opportunity to participate in equity-
based benefits and, subject to the previous paragraph, individual employment agreements) of the surviving corporation or any of its
subsidiaries (which we refer to as the "company plans") at benefit levels that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those in
effect at Rackspace or its subsidiaries on the date of the merger agreement, and provide compensation and benefits to each
continuing employee pursuant to such company plans; (2) provide compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than
opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and, subject to the previous paragraph, individual employment agreements) to
each continuing employee that, taken as a whole, are substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements)
provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as "comparable
plans"); or (3) provide some combination of company plans and comparable plans such that each continuing employee receives

compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and, subject to the
previous paragraph, individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are substantially similar in the aggregate to the
compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and individual
employment agreements) provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. In each case,
base compensation and target incentive compensation opportunity will not be decreased for a period of one year following the
effective time of the merger for any continuing employee employed during that period. For a period of one year following the
effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to) provide severance
benefits to eligible full-time regular employees no less favorable than Rackspace's past practices and severance calculation set forth
in the Rackspace disclosure letter, without regard to the right to exercise discretion to reduce such levels, taking into account service
both before and after the closing of the merger.

        To the extent that a company plan or comparable plan is made available to a continuing employee at or after the effective time
of the merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation or one of its
subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such continuing employee credit for all service with Rackspace and its subsidiaries prior to
the effective time of the merger for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service
is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement, but excluding for purposes of benefit accruals
under any defined benefit pension plans or retiree health plans), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it
would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, (1) each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries (other than the company plans) (which we refer to as the "new plans") to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such
new plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable company plan in which such continuing employee participates immediately
before the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as the "old plans"); (2) for purposes of each new plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to any continuing employee, the surviving corporation will undertake
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such new plans to be waived for such continuing employee and his or
her covered dependents, and the surviving corporation will undertake commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the old
plan ending on the date that such continuing employee's participation in the corresponding new plan begins to be given full credit
pursuant to such new plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such new plan; and (3) credit the accounts of such continuing employees pursuant to any new plan that is a
flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such continuing employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued
but unused by a continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be credited to such continuing
employee following the effective time of the merger and will be subject to the vacation policies of the surviving corporation as in
effect from time to time; provided that vacation accrued but unused as of the closing of the merger will remain available to the same
extent as under Rackspace programs in effect as of the date of the merger agreement as applied to each continuing employee.

Interests of Rackspace's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        When considering the recommendation of the Rackspace Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or
in addition to, your interests as a Rackspace stockholder. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the

merger agreement and the merger; and (3) recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by Rackspace stockholders, the
Rackspace Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These
interests include the following:

• the potential acceleration of vesting, upon the effective time of the merger, or in accordance with the unvested stock-
based award treatment or upon a qualifying termination of employment following the effective time of the merger, of
company options, company stock-based awards or both (for more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned "The Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards"); and 

• the entitlement of each executive officer to receive payments and benefits pursuant to certain employment
agreements entered into prior to the commencement of discussions or negotiations regarding the merger or pursuant
to the Severance Plan if, within the applicable period following the merger, the executive officer's employment is
terminated by Rackspace other than for "Cause," death, or disability or by the executive officer for "Good Reason"
(as such terms are defined in the applicable employment agreement or the Severance Plan, as applicable) (as
described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Interests of Rackspace's Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Termination Following Change of Control").

        If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved, the common stock held by our directors and executive
officers will be treated in the same manner as the common stock held by all other Rackspace stockholders. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Interests of Rackspace's Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger."

Appraisal Rights 

        If the merger is consummated, Rackspace stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who
continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger, who properly perfect appraisal of their shares and who meet
certain other conditions and statutory requirements described herein will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the "fair value" of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Court of Chancery in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to be fair value
from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of 5% over the Federal Reserve discount
rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the
date of payment of the judgment (provided that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving
corporation pays to each Rackspace stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the
sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court of
Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time), so long as they comply with the procedures, and subject to
the conditions, set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, Rackspace stockholders who
wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal
rights.

        Rackspace stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they
would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.

Table of Contents

        Only a Rackspace stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of
record must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Rackspace before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; and (3) continue to hold the
subject shares of common stock of record through the effective time of the merger. The failure to follow exactly the procedures
specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss
appraisal proceedings in respect of Rackspace unless certain conditions are satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal, as
described further below. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further
detail in this proxy statement, and a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is
attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and
you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate
procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement
captioned "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger") in exchange for such U.S. Holder's
shares of common stock in the merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the
difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the merger and such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax
basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger.

        A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger") generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common
stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

        For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger." Rackspace stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising
under U.S. federal income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger 

        Under the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the waiting periods (and any extensions thereof, if any)
applicable to the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which we refer to as the
"HSR Act") and the competition laws of the European Union and Israel have expired or otherwise been terminated, or all requisite
consents pursuant thereto have been obtained.

Financing of the Merger 

        Rackspace anticipates that the total funds needed to complete the merger (including the funds to pay Rackspace stockholders
and to pay the holders of other equity-based interests the amounts due to them under the merger agreement), which is expected to be
approximately $4.9 billion, will be funded through a combination of the following:

• Debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3.2 billion as well as a committed $225 million senior
secured revolving facility, a portion of which will be available at closing. Parent has received firm commitments
from a consortium of financial institutions to provide the

debt financing, which includes the revolving credit facility. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned "Financing of the Merger—Debt Financing."

• Equity commitments by the Apollo Funds in an aggregate amount of up to $1.707 billion. Parent has received equity
commitments for the equity financing from the Apollo Funds. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned "Financing of the Merger—Equity Financing." 

• Cash of Rackspace and its subsidiaries available to be utilized in respect of the payment of the merger consideration
to Rackspace stockholders and holders of company stock-based awards and company options, if any.

The completion of the merger is not conditioned upon Parent's receipt of financing.

Limited Guarantee 

        Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Rackspace's willingness to
enter into the merger agreement, Parent and Merger Sub delivered to Rackspace a limited guarantee (which we refer to as the
"limited guarantee") in favor of Rackspace from Apollo Investment Fund VIII, L.P., Apollo Overseas Partners (Delaware 892)
VIII, L.P., Apollo Overseas Partners (Delaware) VIII, L.P., and Apollo Overseas Partners VIII, L.P. (which we refer to as the
"guarantors") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the guarantors are guaranteeing certain
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the merger agreement.

No Solicitation of Other Offers 

        Under the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger (or the earlier
termination of the merger agreement), Rackspace has agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations with, and terminate any data room or other diligence access of, any person, its affiliates and its representatives (as
defined below) relating to an acquisition transaction (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers") and to request that any person who executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of acquiring Rackspace to promptly return or destroy all non-public information furnished by or
on behalf of Rackspace prior to the date of the merger agreement.

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger (or the
earlier termination of the merger agreement), Rackspace and its subsidiaries and its and their respective affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors (which we refer to as "representatives") will not, and will not permit or
direct any of its or its subsidiaries representatives to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or
assist, any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal (as defined in the
section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers"); 

• furnish or otherwise provide access to any non-public information regarding, or to the business, properties, assets,
books, records or personnel of, Rackspace or its subsidiaries to any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective designees) in any case in connection with any acquisition proposal, or with the intent to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an acquisition proposal or
the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

• participate, or engage in discussions or negotiations, with any person with respect to an acquisition proposal or with
respect to any inquiries from third parties relating to the making of an acquisition proposal; 

• approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an acquisition
proposal; 

• enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or other contract relating to an acquisition agreement (other than an acceptable
confidentiality agreement) (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—No
Solicitation of Other Offers"); 

• fail to enforce or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of
securities of Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries (unless the Rackspace Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law, except that Rackspace will be permitted to waive any provision of any
standstill or confidentiality agreement only to the extent that such provision prohibits a confidential proposal being
made to the Rackspace Board); or 

• authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.

        Notwithstanding these restrictions, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Rackspace stockholders and after entering
into an acceptable confidentiality agreement, Rackspace and the Rackspace Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or
indirectly through one or more of their representatives, following the execution of an acceptable confidentiality agreement:
(a) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with; (b) furnish any non-public information in relation to Rackspace or any
of its subsidiaries to; or (c) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any
personnel, of Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries to, any person or its representatives that has made or delivered to Rackspace a
bona fide written acquisition proposal if: (1) Rackspace, its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives have not
breached any of the non-solicitation restrictions above with respect to the acquisition proposal or such person; (2) the Rackspace
Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel,
that such acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal (as defined in the section of this
proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers"); and (3) the Rackspace Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. In such circumstances, Rackspace will substantially contemporaneously make available
to Parent any non-public information concerning Rackspace and its subsidiaries that is provided to any such person or its
representatives that was not previously made available to Parent. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers."

        Rackspace is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal unless it
complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with Parent during a
specified period. If Rackspace terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal, it must pay a $112 million
termination fee to Parent. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—The
Rackspace Board's Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change."

Change in the Rackspace Board's Recommendation 

        The Rackspace Board may not withdraw its recommendation that Rackspace stockholders adopt the merger agreement or take
certain similar actions other than, under certain circumstances, if it (or a

that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Rackspace Board's fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and complies with
the provisions of the merger agreement.

        However, the Rackspace Board cannot withdraw its recommendation that Rackspace stockholders adopt the merger agreement
or take certain similar actions unless it complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith
negotiations with Parent during a specified period. If Rackspace terminates the merger agreement because the Rackspace Board
withdraws its recommendation that Rackspace stockholders adopt the merger agreement or takes certain similar actions, then
Rackspace must pay a $112 million termination fee to Parent. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned "The Merger Agreement—The Rackspace Board's Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change."

Conditions to the Closing of the Merger 

        The obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and Rackspace, as applicable, to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction
or waiver (where permitted by applicable law) of certain conditions, including the following:

• the adoption of the merger agreement by the requisite affirmative vote of Rackspace stockholders;

the HSR Act and the antitrust laws of the European Union and Israel; and

preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction; (2) by
any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction; or (3) the enactment, enforcement or deemed application of
any law.

        In addition, the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver

materiality qualifiers, as of the effective time of the merger or the date in respect of which such representation or
warranty was specifically made; 

• the performance and compliance in all material respects by Rackspace of and with the covenants and obligations
required to be performed and complied with by Rackspace under the merger agreement at or prior to the effective
time of the merger; 

• the absence of any Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned
"The Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties") or a material adverse effect with respect to Rackspace
and its subsidiaries (as defined in the merger agreement) having occurred after the date of merger agreement that is
continuing as of the effective time of the merger; and 

• since the date of the merger agreement, the Rackspace Board (or any equivalent governing body of any non-wholly
owned subsidiary of Rackspace) not having declared, set aside, established a record date for, authorized, made or

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

        The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the merger, the merger agreement and the
special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to you. We encourage you to carefully read
the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, including the annexes to this proxy statement and the other
documents to which we refer to in this proxy statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement
without charge by following the instructions in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Where You Can Find More Information."

Q: Why am I receiving these materials? 

A: On August 26, 2016, we announced that Rackspace entered into the merger agreement. Under the merger agreement, Parent will
acquire Rackspace for $32.00 per share in cash. In order to complete the merger, Rackspace stockholders must vote to adopt the
merger agreement at the special meeting. We must receive stockholder approval to complete the merger. For more information, see
the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger." The Rackspace
Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of common stock in connection with the
solicitation of proxies of Rackspace stockholders to be voted in favor of the merger proposal at the special meeting. 

This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement and
the special meeting. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares without attending the special meeting.

Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy as soon as
possible.

Q: What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting? 

A: You are being asked to vote on the following proposals: 

• to adopt the merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Rackspace, and Rackspace will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; 

• to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; 

• to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger; and

and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly
brought before the special meeting.

Q: May I attend the special meeting and vote in person? 

A: Yes. Subject to the requirements described in this proxy statement, all Rackspace stockholders as of the record date may attend the
special meeting and vote in person. Seating will be limited. Rackspace stockholders will need to present proof of ownership of
shares of common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification to be admitted to the
special meeting. No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the
special meeting. 

If, as of the record date, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," you may not vote your shares in person at the
special meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares
in person at the special meeting. Otherwise, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or
other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, without your
instructions.

Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the special meeting, we
encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy
electronically over the internet or by telephone. If you attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will
revoke any proxy previously submitted.

Q: What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Rackspace? 

A: The proposed merger is the acquisition of Rackspace by Parent, which is an affiliate of the Apollo Funds. If the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement is approved by Rackspace stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are
satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Rackspace, with Rackspace continuing as the surviving corporation. As a
result of the merger, Rackspace will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and our common stock will no longer be
publicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act,
and we may no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. 

Q: What will I receive if the merger is completed? 

A: Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration in cash, without interest and less
any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised, and not
validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal rights under the DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are
satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will receive $3,200.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of
common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. 

Q: How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of the common stock prior to the public
announcement of the merger agreement? 

A: The per share merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 38.2% over the closing price of the common stock on
August 3, 2016, the last trading day prior to news reports speculating that Rackspace was the subject of a potential acquisition
transaction.

Table of Contents

Q: What do I need to do now? 

A: We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement carefully and consider how the merger affects you. Then, even if you expect to attend the special meeting, sign,
date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or grant your proxy
electronically over the internet or by telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the special meeting. Please do not send your
stock certificates with your proxy card.

If you hold your shares in "street name," please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee for additional information on how to vote your shares.

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now? 

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock
certificates or surrender your book-entry shares to the payment agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the
shares of common stock represented by your stock certificates. Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of
transmittal to exchange your stock certificates or book-entry shares for the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not
send your stock certificates with your proxy card. 

Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special
meeting? 

A: The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the expected effective date of the merger.
If you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special
arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your
shares and each of you notifies Rackspace in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per
share merger consideration, if the merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your shares, but you
will retain your right to vote those shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common
stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying
prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. 

Q: How does the Rackspace Board recommend that I vote? 

A: The Rackspace Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) "FOR" the
adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; (3) "FOR" the compensation that will or may
become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (4) "FOR" the acceleration of
vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors. 

Q: Why am I being asked to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by
Rackspace to its named executive officers in connection with the merger? 

A: SEC rules require Rackspace to seek approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable
by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the
compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is not
required to complete the merger.

Table of Contents

Q: What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to its named executive officers in connection with
the merger for purposes of this advisory vote? 

A: The compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to its named executive officers in connection with the merger is
certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain of Rackspace's named executive officers pursuant
to underlying plans and arrangements that are contractual in nature. Compensation that will or may become payable by Parent to
our named executive officers in connection with or following the merger is not subject to this advisory vote. For more information,
see the section of this proxy statement captioned "Proposal 3: Approval, on a Non-Binding, Advisory Basis, of Certain Merger-
Related Executive Compensation Arrangements." 

Q: What will happen if Rackspace stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by
Rackspace to its named executive officers in connection with the merger? 

A: Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with
the merger is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable
by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is an advisory vote and will not be binding on
Rackspace or Parent. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by Rackspace stockholders and the merger is completed, the
compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger will
or may be paid to Rackspace's named executive officers even if Rackspace stockholders do not approve such compensation. 

Q: Why am I being asked to approve the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee
directors? 

A: We have a policy of granting an annual restricted stock unit award to our non-employee directors. We have determined that the
equity plan and related agreements under which these awards were granted arguably do not address how the vesting of the annual
restricted stock unit award to non-employee directors is impacted when a non-employee director's service with Rackspace
terminates (which is expected to occur in connection with the merger). Although we believe that the intent of the equity plan and
related agreements is and has always been to provide full vesting acceleration upon a termination of a non-employee director's
service in connection with a "change of control" (including the completion of the merger), the Rackspace Board recognizes that the
non-employee directors would be the beneficiaries of that interpretation. Accordingly, the Rackspace Board has elected to subject
this result to a confirmatory vote of Rackspace stockholders. 

Q: What will happen if Rackspace stockholders do not approve the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by
Rackspace's non-employee directors? 

A: Approval of the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors is not a condition to
completion of the merger. If the acceleration of vesting is not approved, then each annual restricted stock unit award granted to our
non-employee directors that is not vested in full will be cancelled in connection with the closing of the merger for no
consideration. 

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed? 

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by Rackspace stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason,
Rackspace stockholders will not receive any payment for their

shares of common stock. Instead, (1) Rackspace will remain an independent public company; (2) our common stock will continue
to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports with
the SEC.

Rackspace has agreed to pay Parent a termination fee of $112 million if the merger agreement is terminated under specified
circumstances.

Parent has agreed to pay Rackspace a termination fee of $253 million if the merger agreement is terminated under specified
circumstances. The payment of this termination fee has been guaranteed by the guarantors.

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees."

Q: What vote is required to adopt the merger agreement? 

A: Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. 

The failure of any Rackspace stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by
telephone; or (3) vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement. If you hold your shares in "street name," the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee
how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions
will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

Q: What vote is required to approve (1) the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; (2) on a
non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to its named executive
officers in connection with the merger; and (3) the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's
non-employee directors? 

A: Approval of the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting
power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. 

Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. The vote on the named
executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal.
Accordingly, a Rackspace stockholder may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the named executive
officer merger-related compensation proposal, and vice versa.

Approval of the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors requires the
affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting
and entitled to vote on the proposal. With respect to this proposal only, we will not consider any shares of common stock that are
beneficially owned by a director or executive officer of Rackspace to be entitled to vote on the proposal. The vote on the
acceleration of the vesting of certain equity awards proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger
proposal. Accordingly, a Rackspace stockholder may

vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the acceleration of the vesting of certain equity awards proposal, and
vice versa.

The failure of any Rackspace stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by
telephone; or (3) vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal, the proposal
to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger or the proposal to approve the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards
held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

If you hold your shares in "street name," the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not
have any effect the adjournment proposal, the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or
may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, or the proposal to approve the
acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

In all cases, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adjournment proposal, the proposal to approve, on a
non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger; and the proposal to approve the acceleration vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-
employee directors.

Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 

A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you
are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the "stockholder of record." If you are a stockholder of record, this proxy
statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf of Rackspace. 

If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares of common
stock held in "street name." If you are a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in "street name," this proxy statement
has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your
shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not
the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person by ballot at the special meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy"
from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

Q: How may I vote? 

A: If you are a Rackspace stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote: 

• by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope; 

• by visiting the internet address on your proxy card; 

• by calling the toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or 

• by attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of common
stock and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the internet or by
telephone. Although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may
incur costs such as internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.

Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of common stock by
proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a "legal proxy" to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your
shares of common stock in person by ballot at the special meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at
the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.

If your shares are held in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other
nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a
service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the internet or by telephone. To vote over the
internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting instruction
form provided by your bank, broker or nominee. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your
shares in person by ballot at the special meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from your bank, broker or other nominee giving
you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

Q: What is a proxy? 

A: A:    A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a "proxy," to vote your shares of common stock. The
written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a "proxy statement." The
document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a "proxy card." William Alberts, our Senior
Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, and William Taylor Rhodes, our President and Chief Executive Officer, with full
powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the proxy holders for the special meeting. 

Q: If my broker holds my shares in "street name," will my broker vote my shares for me? 

A: A:    No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered
at the special meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such
proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted "AGAINST" adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no effect
on the adjournment proposal, the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger or the proposal to approve the acceleration of
vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors. 

Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card? 

A: Yes. If you are a Rackspace stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at
the special meeting by: 

• signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting; 

• submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; 

• delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or

• attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot. 

If you hold your shares of common stock in "street name," you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the special meeting if you obtain a "legal
proxy" from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

Q: If a Rackspace stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted? 

A: Regardless of the method you choose to grant a proxy to vote your shares, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will
vote your shares in the way that you direct. 

If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares
represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (1) "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) "FOR" the
adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; (3) "FOR" the compensation that will or may
become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (4) "FOR" the acceleration of
vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials? 

A: Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting
instruction form that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted. 

You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards
or voting instruction cards, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account. For example, if you hold
your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in
which you hold shares. If you are a Rackspace stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you
will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote all voting materials that you receive.

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting? 

A: If available, Rackspace may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. Rackspace intends to
publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports
that Rackspace files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned "Where You Can Find More Information." 

Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger? 

A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger"), the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and
such U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger.

Table of Contents

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger") generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common
stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under
U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of
material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The
Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger."

Q: What will the holders of company options and company stock-based awards receive in the merger? 

A: At the effective time of the merger, each company option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into, and will become a right to receive
the option consideration less any applicable withholding taxes. If the per share exercise price of any company option, whether
vested or unvested, is equal to or greater than the per share merger consideration, such company option will be cancelled as of the
effective time of the merger without any cash payment and will have no further effect. 

At the effective time of the merger, each company stock-based award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger, to the extent vested (which generally includes unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards that are
otherwise scheduled to vest by their terms on or before December 31, 2016, as discussed in the following paragraph) and, if
applicable, unexercised will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the company stock-based award consideration less
any applicable withholding taxes.

At the effective time of the merger, each unvested time-vesting company stock-based award will be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the company stock-based award consideration in respect of such
unvested time-vesting company stock-based award, generally payable in semi-annual installments following the effective time of
the merger depending on the original vesting schedule of the corresponding company stock-based award and the title (as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of the holder of such award, as follows:

Table of Contents

Vice President and Below 

Unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards that are scheduled to vest by their terms on or before December 31, 2016,
generally will fully vest as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and will be subject to the vested stock-based
award treatment rather than the unvested stock-based award treatment.

With respect to each performance company stock-based award that was granted (1) after August 22, 2013, the applicable
performance metrics will be deemed to have been satisfied as to 100% of the target number of shares of common stock subject to
such performance company stock-based award as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, regardless of when the
performance period ends, with each such performance company stock-based award granted (a) prior to December 1, 2015, subject
to the vested stock-based award treatment and (b) on or after December 1, 2015, subject to the unvested stock-based award
treatment; and (2) on August 22, 2013, such performance company stock-based award will be treated in accordance with its terms.

The receipt of the company stock-based award consideration in respect of such unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards
and unvested performance company stock-based awards, in each case, that are subject to the unvested stock-based award treatment
is generally subject to the recipient's continued employment following the effective time of the merger, except that any then-unpaid
portion of a recipient's company stock-based award consideration generally will become immediately payable if such recipient's
termination of employment (whenever occurring) is either (1) without Cause (as defined in the 2007 LTIP); or (2) for Good Reason
(as defined in either (a) the Severance Plan, if the recipient is a participant in the Severance Plan as of immediately prior to such
employee's termination date; or (b) an effective employment agreement between such employee and Rackspace, the surviving
corporation or their affiliates in all other cases) (for the avoidance of doubt, clause (2) shall not apply to any employee who as of
immediately prior to such employee's termination of employment is neither a participant in the Severance Plan nor is party to an
effective employment agreement that contains a definition of "Good Reason"). However, before the effective time of the merger,
Rackspace may provide different vesting terms for any employee that are no more favorable to such employee than the terms
described above. Any payments of stock-based award consideration in respect of unvested time-vesting company stock-based
awards and unvested performance company stock-based awards will be subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

Parent will not assume, substitute or convert any company stock-based award that is outstanding and, if applicable, unexercised, as
of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and that is held by a non-employee member of the Rackspace Board. Each
company stock-based award that is outstanding, and, if applicable, unexercised, as of immediately prior to the effective time and
that is held by a non-employee member of the Rackspace Board will, subject to the approval of the Rackspace stockholders
(excluding, for this purpose, any shares of common stock beneficially held by such non-employee members of the Rackspace
Board) be fully vested as of immediately prior to the effective time and will be subject to the vested stock-based award treatment.

Equity-Based Awards."

Q: What will happen to the ESPP? 

A: Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Rackspace Board has adopted resolutions, and has amended the terms of the
ESPP as necessary, (1) providing that each individual participating in the Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) in progress on
the date of the merger agreement (which we refer to as the "final offering") will not be permitted to (a) increase his or her payroll
contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect when that Purchase Period commenced; or (b) make separate non-
payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date of the merger agreement, except as may be required by applicable law;
(2) ensuring that, except for the final offering, no offering period under the ESPP will be authorized or commenced on or after the
date of the merger agreement; (3) if the closing of the merger will occur prior to the end of the final offering, providing each
individual participating in the final offering with notice of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement prior to the
closing of the merger; (4) causing the final offering to end no later than one business day prior to the closing of the merger;
(5) making any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened final offering Purchase Period, but otherwise
treat such shortened final offering Purchase Period as a fully effective and completed Purchase Period for all purposes pursuant to
the ESPP; (6) causing each ESPP participant's accumulated contributions under the ESPP to be used to purchase shares of common
stock in accordance with the ESPP as of the end of the final offering; (7) providing that the applicable purchase price for the
common stock will not be decreased below the levels set forth in the ESPP as of the date of the merger agreement; (8) ensuring
that no further rights are granted under the ESPP after the effective time of the merger; and (9) effective as of the effective time of
the merger (but subject to the consummation of the merger), terminating the ESPP. 

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A: We currently expect to complete the merger this calendar year. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all,
cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are
outside of our control. 

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL? 

A: If the merger is consummated, Rackspace stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who
continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger, who properly perfect appraisal of their shares and who
meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements described herein will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the "fair value" of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Court of Chancery in its
discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to be fair
value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger
and the date of payment of the judgment (provided that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving
corporation pays to each Rackspace stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue thereafter only upon
the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by

the Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time), so long as they comply with the procedures,
and subject to the conditions, set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Rackspace stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their
shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the
complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in
this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is attached as Annex C to this proxy
statement.

Q: Do any of Rackspace's directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Rackspace
stockholders generally? 

A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Rackspace Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you
should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to,
the interests of Rackspace stockholders generally. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the
merger agreement and the merger; and (3) unanimously recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by Rackspace
stockholders, the Rackspace Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among
other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Interests of Rackspace's
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included in oral statements or
other written statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain "forward-looking statements" that do not directly or
exclusively relate to historical facts. You can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words, such as
"may," "should," "could," "project," "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "continue," "potential," "plan," "forecast" and other
words of similar import. Rackspace stockholders are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-
looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including in
our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, and
the following factors:

• the inability to complete the merger due to the failure of Rackspace stockholders to adopt the merger agreement or failure
to satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the merger, including receipt of required regulatory approvals; 

• the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay Parent a termination fee of
$112 million; 

• the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the merger agreement; 

• risks that the merger affects our ability to retain or recruit employees; 

• the fact that receipt of the all-cash per share merger consideration would be taxable to Rackspace stockholders that are
treated as U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

• the fact that, if the merger is completed, Rackspace stockholders will forego the opportunity to realize the potential long-
term value of the successful execution of Rackspace's current strategy as an independent company; 

• the possibility that Rackspace could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts,
special dividends or the sale of some or all of Rackspace's assets to one or more as yet unknown purchasers, that could
conceivably produce a higher aggregate value than that available to Rackspace stockholders in the merger; 

• the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Rackspace is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the
pendency of the merger; 

• the effect of the announcement or pendency of the merger on our business relationships, customers, operating results and
business generally, including risks related to the diversion of the attention of Rackspace management or employees during
the pendency of the merger; 

• the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the merger agreement or the merger; 

• the risk that the merger will not be consummated in a timely manner, exceeding the expected costs of the merger; 

• the risk that our stock price may decline significantly if the merger is not completed; and 

• risks related to obtaining the requisite consents to the merger, including the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals from
various domestic and foreign governmental bodies (including any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on these
approvals) and the risk that one or more governmental bodies may deny approval.

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Rackspace Board for use at the special meeting.

Date, Time and Place 

        We will hold the special meeting on Wednesday, November 2, 2016, at Rackspace's Corporate Headquarters, 1 Fanatical Place,
San Antonio, TX 78218, at 8:30 a.m., Central time.

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        At the special meeting, we will ask Rackspace stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement; (2) adjourn the
special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; (3) approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (4) approve the acceleration of vesting
of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum 

        Only Rackspace stockholders as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special
meeting. A list of Rackspace stockholders of record entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available at our principal executive
offices located at 1 Fanatical Place, San Antonio, TX 78218, during regular business hours for a period of no less than 10 days before the
special meeting and at the place of the special meeting during the meeting.

        As of the record date, there were 126,384,875 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each
share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting.

        The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to
vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum at the special meeting.

Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 

        Approval of the adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. Adoption of the merger agreement by Rackspace's stockholders is a condition to the
closing of the merger.

        Approval of the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

        Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in
person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. The vote on the named executive officer
merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve the merger proposal. Accordingly, a Rackspace
stockholder may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation
proposal, and vice versa.

        Approval of the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person

or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. With respect to this proposal only, we will not consider
any shares of common stock that are beneficially owned by a director or executive officer of Rackspace to be entitled to vote on the
proposal. The vote on the acceleration of the vesting of certain equity awards proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to
approve the merger proposal. Accordingly, a Rackspace stockholder may vote to approve the merger proposal and vote not to approve the
acceleration of the vesting of certain equity awards proposal, and vice versa.

        If a Rackspace stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted:
(1) "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) "AGAINST" any proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date
to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting;
(3) "AGAINST" the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace
to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (4) "AGAINST" the proposal to approve the acceleration of vesting of
certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors. Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining
whether a quorum exists.

        A "broker non-vote" generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a
proposal because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote your
shares. We do not expect any "broker non-votes," at the special meeting, but if there are any, they will be counted for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present. If there are broker non-votes, each broker non-vote will count as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the proposal to (1) adjourn the special meeting to a later date to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; (2) approve, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection
with the merger; or (3) approve the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

Shares Held by Rackspace's Directors and Executive Officers 

        As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 20,168,261
shares of common stock, representing approximately 16% of the shares of common stock outstanding as of the record date. Our directors
and executive officers have informed us that they intend to vote all of their shares of common stock: (1) "FOR" the adoption of the merger
agreement; (2) "FOR" the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) "FOR" the compensation
that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.

        Pursuant to the voting agreement, Mr. Weston and certain of his affiliates are obligated to, among other things, vote their shares of
common stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Mr. Weston and his affiliates own, in the aggregate, approximately
15% of our common stock. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Voting Agreement."

Voting of Proxies 

        If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you may cause
your shares to be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or you may vote in person
by ballot at the special meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone by

following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy
card, in order to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. Based on your proxy cards or internet and telephone
proxies, the proxy holders will vote your shares according to your directions.

        If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Rackspace
stockholders will need to present proof of ownership of shares of common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a
form of personal identification to be admitted to the special meeting. If your shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to
vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person. If you attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your
vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.

        All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the special
meeting in accordance with the instructions of the Rackspace stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting
instructions will be voted: (1) "FOR" adoption of the merger agreement; (2) "FOR" the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date
or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of
the special meeting; (3) "FOR" the compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger; and (4) "FOR" the acceleration of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee
directors.

        If your shares are held in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other
nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or by attending the
special meeting and voting in person with a "legal proxy" from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares
at the special meeting. If available, you may vote over the internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following
the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not (1) return your bank's,
broker's or other nominee's voting instruction form; (2) vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee,
if possible; or (3) attend the special meeting and vote in person with a "legal proxy" from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have
the same effect as if you voted "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. It will not have any effect on the proposals:
(1) to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the
merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; (2) to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; or (3) to approve the acceleration of vesting
of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

Revocability of Proxies 

        If you are a Rackspace stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
special meeting by:

• signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting; 

• submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; 

• delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or 

• attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.

        If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the special meeting, in the absence of voting in person or submitting an additional
proxy or revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.

        If you hold your shares of common stock in "street name," you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions
regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the special meeting if you obtain a "legal proxy" from your bank,
broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

        Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the special meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, will
allow Rackspace stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the special meeting as
adjourned, postponed or delayed.

The Rackspace Board's Recommendation 

        The Rackspace Board, after considering various factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—
Recommendation of the Rackspace Board and Reasons for the Merger," has unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement, the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Rackspace and its
stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

        The Rackspace Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) "FOR" the
adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; (3) "FOR" the compensation that will or may become payable by
Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (4) "FOR" the acceleration of vesting of certain equity
awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

Adjournment 

        In addition to the proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement; (2) approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that
will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) approve the acceleration
of vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors, Rackspace stockholders are also being asked to approve
the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional votes or proxies in favor of
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger
agreement. If a quorum is not present, the chairperson of the special meeting or the Rackspace stockholders entitled to vote at the special
meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, may adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. In addition, the special meeting could be postponed before it
commences, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed, Rackspace stockholders who
have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to the final vote on the proposals.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by Rackspace. We have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a professional proxy
solicitation firm, to solicit proxies in connection with the special meeting at a cost of approximately $25,000 plus expenses. We also will
indemnify Innisfree M&A Incorporated against losses arising out of its provisions of these services on our behalf. In addition, we may
reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares for their

Table of Contents

expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers and
employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax or over the internet. No additional compensation will be paid for such services.

Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger 

        We currently expect to complete the merger this calendar year. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all,
cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside
of our control.

Appraisal Rights 

        If the merger is consummated, Rackspace stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who
continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger, who properly perfect appraisal of their shares and who meet certain
other conditions and statutory requirements described herein will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under
Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the "fair value" of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise
for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment
(provided that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each Rackspace stockholder
entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount
so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery; and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that
time), so long as they comply with the procedures, and subject to the conditions, set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Due to the
complexity of the appraisal process, Rackspace stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice
of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.

        Rackspace stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would
receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.

        Only a Rackspace stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record
must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to Rackspace before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
(2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; and (3) continue to hold the subject shares of
common stock of record through the effective time of the merger. The failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL
will result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal as to all Rackspace
stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected
exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL; or
(2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of the shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds
$1 million. The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy
statement, and a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is attached as Annex C to
this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal

rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand
for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee.

Table of Contents

Effect of the Merger 

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the
merger; (1) Merger Sub will merge with and into Rackspace; (2) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease; and
(3) Rackspace will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

        As a result of the merger, Rackspace will cease to be a publicly traded company. If the merger is completed, you will not own any
shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.

        The effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and acceptance of that certificate by, the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as we, Parent and Merger Sub may agree and specify in such certificate of
merger).

Effect on Rackspace if the Merger is Not Completed

        If the merger agreement is not adopted by Rackspace stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Rackspace
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock by virtue of the merger agreement. Instead, (1) Rackspace will
remain an independent public company; (2) our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the
Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, we expect that:
(1) our management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today; and (2) Rackspace
stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to
the highly competitive industry in which Rackspace operates and adverse economic conditions.

        Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be completed, the
price of our common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock
would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

        Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future
value of your shares of common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Rackspace Board will continue to evaluate and review, among
other things, Rackspace's business, operations, strategic direction and capitalization, and will make whatever changes it deems appropriate.
If the merger agreement is not adopted by Rackspace stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Rackspace's
business, prospects or results of operation may be adversely impacted.

Per Share Merger Consideration

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each outstanding share of common stock
(other than shares (1) held by Rackspace as treasury stock; (2) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Rackspace, Parent or Merger Sub; and (4) held by any Rackspace stockholder who has properly made a demand for
appraisal under Delaware law and has neither effectively withdrawn, failed to perfect, waived or otherwise lost such stockholder's right to
appraisal with respect to such shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the per share merger
consideration.

        At or prior to the closing of the merger, a sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated payment agent to pay the
aggregate per share merger consideration. Once a Rackspace stockholder has provided the payment agent with his, her or its stock
certificates (or customary agent's message with respect to book-entry shares), letter of transmittal and other items specified by the payment
agent, the payment agent will promptly pay the stockholder the per share merger

consideration. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—Payment Agent,
Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures."

        After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration (as described in the section of this
proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—Conversion of Shares"), but you will no longer have any rights as a Rackspace
stockholder (except that Rackspace stockholders who properly and validly exercise and perfect, and do not validly withdraw or
subsequently lose, their appraisal rights will have the right to receive payment for the "fair value" of their shares, determined pursuant to
an appraisal proceeding contemplated by Delaware law (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—
Appraisal Rights")).

Background of the Merger 

        The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement. This chronology
does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Transactions Committee, the Rackspace Board or the representatives of
Rackspace, and other parties.

        The Rackspace Board regularly evaluates Rackspace's strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward
strengthening Rackspace's business and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the Rackspace Board has, from time to
time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives. These have included, among others, (1) the continuation of Rackspace's current
business plan; (2) investment in and development of new products; (3) potential expansion opportunities into new business lines through
acquisitions and combinations of Rackspace with other businesses; and (4) a possible sale of Rackspace or one or more of its business
units.

        In May 2014, Rackspace disclosed that it had been approached by multiple parties who expressed interest in exploring a strategic
relationship with Rackspace, ranging from partnership to acquisition. Rackspace also disclosed that the Rackspace Board had hired
Morgan Stanley & Co. (which we refer to as "Morgan Stanley") to evaluate the inbound strategic proposals and to explore other
alternatives that could advance Rackspace's long-term strategy.

        In September 2014, Rackspace announced that the Rackspace Board had ended its evaluation of alternatives that would result in
Rackspace being acquired. The Rackspace Board determined to pursue Rackspace's standalone business plan.

        On August 3, 2015, the Rackspace Board retained Goldman Sachs to assist it in connection with requests from certain of its
stockholders. The Rackspace Board selected Goldman Sachs due to its experience and expertise in helping companies manage their
relationships with their stockholders.

        In late 2015, Rackspace received unsolicited inquiries from several financial sponsors (not including Apollo) concerning Rackspace's
interest in pursuing a significant minority investment or a change-of-control-transaction.

        On December 3, 2015, in response to these inquiries and to coordinate and recommend possible responses, if any, the Rackspace
Board formed a working group of independent directors. We refer to this working group as the "Transactions Committee." Rackspace's
lead independent director, Michael Sam Gilliland, along with Kevin Costello and John Harper, were appointed as the members of the
Transactions Committee. Mr. Gilliland was designated by the Rackspace Board as the chairman of the Transactions Committee. The
Rackspace Board elected to form the Transactions Committee in light of (1) the potentially significant workload that could be involved in
considering a potential acquisition of Rackspace and other strategic alternatives; (2) the possibility that Rackspace management might
need feedback and direction on relatively short notice; and (3) a desire to have independent directors oversee and direct the process of
considering strategic alternatives. The Transactions Committee was initially authorized, among other things, to (1) review any financial
analysis of Rackspace that may be performed, including with respect to Rackspace management's long-term operating model; and

(2) advise and direct Rackspace management with respect to communications and interactions with third parties relating to an exploration
of potential strategic alternative transactions. The Rackspace Board instructed the Transactions Committee to report to the Rackspace
Board on a regular basis.

        In early December 2015, in response to an inquiry from Rackspace, Mr. Weston indicated that he would not seek to partner with a
potential acquirer to maintain his ownership interest in Rackspace. Mr. Weston is the beneficial owner of approximately 15% of the
common stock.

        On December 8, 2015, the Transactions Committee held its first meeting, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of
Rackspace management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation (which we refer to as "Wilson
Sonsini") in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Transactions Committee their fiduciary
duties. The members of the Transactions Committee discussed the process for engaging in an exploration of Rackspace's value on a
standalone basis and in connection with a significant minority investment or a change-of-control-transaction. The Transactions Committee
instructed Rackspace management to work with Goldman Sachs to better understand Goldman Sachs' financial analysis of Rackspace. The
Transactions Committee selected Goldman Sachs in light of Goldman Sachs' familiarity with Rackspace and its experience and expertise
in industries similar to those of Rackspace and in advising corporations considering strategic alternatives.

        On December 10, 2015, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The members of the Transactions Committee continued to discuss the
process for evaluating Rackspace's value on a standalone basis and in connection with a significant minority investment or a change-of-
control-transaction.

        On December 15, 2015, the Transactions Committee met, with members of Rackspace management in attendance. Members of
Rackspace management provided the members of the Transactions Committee with perspectives on Rackspace management's long-term
operating model.

        On December 21, 2015, the Transactions Committee met, with members of Rackspace management in attendance. Members of
Rackspace management reviewed Rackspace management's long-term operating model with the members of the Transactions Committee.

        During January 2016 and again in March 2016, Mr. Rhodes, accompanied by a member of the Transactions Committee, held
preliminary discussions with four financial sponsors who had previously made unsolicited inquiries in late 2015 (not including Apollo, but
including a financial sponsor that we refer to as "Party B" and a financial sponsor that we refer to as "Party C") to better understand the
nature of their interest in a significant minority investment in, or a change-of-control-transaction with, Rackspace. These discussions were
approved in advance by the Transactions Committee. All four of these financial sponsors later participated in the sale process conducted
by the Transactions Committee with the assistance of Goldman Sachs, but only Apollo, Party B and Party C submitted an indication of
interest.

        On January 18, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with members of Rackspace management in attendance. The members of the
Transactions Committee discussed the meetings with financial sponsors.

        On February 27, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with members of Rackspace management in attendance. The members of the
Transactions Committee discussed the meetings with financial sponsors.

        On March 22, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed

Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed various strategic alternatives available to Rackspace,
including (1) a sale of the company and (2) a significant minority investment. The members of the Transactions Committee discussed the
process associated with Rackspace's consideration of strategic alternatives.

        On March 25, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed
with the members of the Transactions Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed Rackspace's
prospects as a standalone company and various strategic alternatives available to Rackspace, including (1) a sale of the company and (2) a
significant minority investment. The members of the Transactions Committee discussed Rackspace management's long-term operating
model and instructed Rackspace management to share it with Goldman Sachs so that Goldman Sachs could report to the Transactions
Committee and the Rackspace Board as to its financial analysis of Rackspace.

        On April 1, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with members of Rackspace management in attendance. The members of the
Transactions Committee discussed the status of their work and Rackspace management's long-term operating model.

        On April 8, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed
various considerations related to commencing a formal process to sell Rackspace. The representatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed
financial sponsors and strategic acquirers that Goldman Sachs believed would have an interest in a potential acquisition of Rackspace.

        On April 11, 2016, the Rackspace Board met, with members of Rackspace management, Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in
attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Rackspace Board their fiduciary duties. The
representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed a summary of Goldman Sachs' preliminary financial analysis. The Rackspace Board discussed
Rackspace's long-term prospects as a standalone company and determined that a sale of Rackspace at the present time might be in the best
interests of Rackspace's stockholders. As a result, the Rackspace Board determined to explore a possible sale of Rackspace. In so doing,
the Rackspace Board was particularly sensitive to minimizing potential information leaks that Rackspace was considering a sale of the
company. This sensitivity related to the significant disruption to Rackspace and its business caused by the public nature of the exploration
process in 2014. As such, the Rackspace Board deliberately chose a strategy that it believed would minimize the potential for information
leaks and their related negative impacts on Rackspace and its business. The Rackspace Board also considered the potential adverse
business consequences of sharing confidential information, including the existence of a potential sale process, with competitors and
partners. The Rackspace Board decided to authorize Goldman Sachs, under the supervision of the Transactions Committee, to begin by
contacting a limited number of financial sponsors (including Apollo) in order to understand their interest in, and potential valuations of,
Rackspace. These financial sponsors were selected by the Transactions Committee with input from Goldman Sachs based on an
assessment as to their ability to consummate an acquisition of Rackspace and their interest in Rackspace's industry. Once the process of
contacting financial sponsors was underway, the Rackspace Board determined that it would, if appropriate, authorize contact with the most
likely potential strategic acquirers. These potential strategic acquirers would be selected with the assistance of Goldman Sachs based on an
assessment as to their perceived potential interest in an acquisition of Rackspace, as well as other potential strategic priorities and financial
ability. The members of the Rackspace Board noted that, in the period since the public disclosure in September 2014 of the conclusion of
its evaluation of strategic alternatives, no strategic acquirer had expressed interest to Rackspace in engaging in a business combination
transaction. Also due to the potential for information leaks, the Rackspace Board decided that the confidentiality agreements to be entered
into

with any interested parties would restrict those parties from contacting any debt financing sources until permission was received from
Rackspace. The Rackspace Board confirmed that (1) the Transactions Committee should continue to oversee, advise and direct Rackspace
management and Goldman Sachs in connection with the exploration, consideration and negotiation of strategic alternatives; and (2) the
Rackspace Board retained final authority to approve any transaction involving Rackspace.

        At the direction of the Transactions Committee, Goldman Sachs, using an evolving process through June 2016, ultimately contacted
14 financial sponsors, including Apollo, concerning their interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Rackspace. Of these, nine entered
into confidentiality agreements with Rackspace and received a management presentation. These confidentiality agreements do not prohibit
the counterparty from making non-public acquisition proposals to Rackspace.

        On April 15, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an
update on the status of initial discussions with the contacted financial sponsors.

        On April 22, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an
update on the status of initial discussions with the contacted financial sponsors.

        On April 25, 2016, Apollo Management signed a confidentiality agreement with Rackspace.

        On April 27, 2016, Mr. Gilliland voluntarily concluded his service on the Rackspace Board after commencing a new role with a firm
that required him to step down from membership on the Rackspace Board. At a meeting of the Rackspace Board later that day, the
Rackspace Board designated Mr. Costello as Rackspace's lead independent director and chairman of the Transactions Committee. The
Rackspace Board also appointed Lila Tretikov to the Transactions Committee.

        On April 29, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The members of the Transactions Committee
discussed the status of a potential acquisition of Rackspace.

        Between May 2, 2016, and May 12, 2016, Rackspace management participated in management presentations with those financial
sponsors interested in a potential acquisition of Rackspace. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also attended these presentations.

        On May 4, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The members of the Transactions Committee
discussed the status of a potential acquisition of Rackspace.

        Beginning in early May 2016, Rackspace opened an online data room containing due diligence material. All nine financial sponsors
that entered into a confidentiality agreement with Rackspace were ultimately provided access to the online data room.

        In mid-May 2016, at the request of the Transactions Committee, all of the financial sponsors considering a potential acquisition of
Rackspace were informed by Goldman Sachs that Rackspace was seeking preliminary indications of acquisition interest by June 1, 2016.

        On June 1, 2016, Rackspace received three preliminary, non-binding indications of interest concerning an acquisition of Rackspace.
Apollo proposed an acquisition for $30 to $33 per share, Party B proposed an acquisition for $29 to $32 per share and Party C proposed an
acquisition for $26 to $28

per share. During the 2016 sale process, Rackspace did not receive an indication of interest or acquisition proposal from any party other
than Apollo, Party B and Party C.

        On June 3, 2016, the Rackspace Board met, with members of Rackspace management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and
Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Rackspace Board their fiduciary
duties. The representatives of Goldman Sachs (1) discussed a summary of Goldman Sachs' preliminary financial analyses and (2) reviewed
the three preliminary, non-binding indications of interest. The Rackspace Board discussed and determined to contact potential strategic
acquirers that the Rackspace Board believed would be interested in a potential acquisition of Rackspace. These potential strategic
acquirers were selected with input from Goldman Sachs based on an assessment of their potential interest in an acquisition of Rackspace,
as well as other potential strategic priorities and financial ability. The Rackspace Board authorized (1) the continuation of due diligence
with Apollo, Party B and Party C; and (2) Goldman Sachs to contact the potential strategic acquirers.

        Commencing on June 3, 2016, representatives of Goldman Sachs, as directed by the Rackspace Board, contacted senior business
leaders of five potential strategic acquirers chosen by the Rackspace Board concerning their interest in a potential acquisition of
Rackspace. All five of these potential strategic acquirers declined to pursue an acquisition for various reasons.

        On June 10, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an
update on the status of discussions with Apollo, Party B and Party C. The representatives of Goldman Sachs informed the Transactions
Committee that, after discussion with senior business leaders of the potential strategic acquirers, all had declined to pursue an acquisition.
The members of the Transactions Committee discussed with Goldman Sachs the various responses from the potential strategic acquirers
and inquired about other strategic acquirers who potentially would have an interest in a potential acquisition of Rackspace. The members
of the Transactions Committee, with input from the representatives of Goldman Sachs, concluded that it was unlikely that any strategic
acquirers other than those already contacted would have an interest in then pursuing an acquisition of Rackspace. This conclusion was
based on, among other things, (1) the current strategic priorities of other potential strategic acquirers; (2) the aggregate cost associated
with an acquisition of Rackspace; and (3) the fact that in the period since the public disclosure in September 2014 of the conclusion of its
evaluation of strategic alternatives, no strategic acquirer had expressed interest to Rackspace in engaging in a business combination
transaction. The members of the Transactions Committee also considered the potential for information leaks and their related negative
impacts on Rackspace and its business inherent in contacting other potential acquirers, as well as the current active interest from Apollo,
Party B and Party C in pursuing a potential acquisition of Rackspace.

        Between June 15, 2016, and June 27, 2016, members of Rackspace management participated in a second set of management
presentations with Apollo, Party B and Party C. Members of Rackspace management also participated in initial management presentations
with certain financial sponsors interested in a potential acquisition of Rackspace who had not participated in the initial management
presentations in early May 2016.

        In mid-June 2016, at the request of the Transactions Committee, Apollo, Party B and Party C were informed by Goldman Sachs that
Rackspace was seeking revised preliminary indications of acquisition interest by July 1, 2016.

        On June 17, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed
ongoing due diligence with Apollo, Party B and Party C. The members of the Transactions Committee discussed the continued interest by
Apollo

(and others) in receiving permission from Rackspace to begin discussions with debt financing sources. The members of the Transactions
Committee discussed the potential for information leaks and their related negative impacts on Rackspace and its business inherent in
allowing debt financing sources into discussions concerning a potential acquisition of Rackspace. The members of the Transactions
Committee weighed this concern against their desire for potential acquirers to submit acquisition proposals that, to the greatest extent
possible, reflected firm terms with limited conditionality. The members of the Transactions Committee determined to reengage with
Morgan Stanley (which, due to its engagement in the 2014 strategic alternative evaluation process, was still potentially entitled to a "tail"
fee in connection with a strategic transaction involving Rackspace, but who was not then aware of the 2016 strategic alternative evaluation
process). Morgan Stanley's role was to make itself available to potential acquirers to discuss financing options. Morgan Stanley did not
advise the Transactions Committee or the Rackspace Board. Morgan Stanley also did not share with the Transactions Committee or the
Rackspace Board any of its discussions with potential acquirers.

        On June 24, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed
(1) recent market volatility; and (2) ongoing due diligence with Apollo, Party B and Party C. The members of the Transactions Committee
provided guidance to Wilson Sonsini on the terms of a draft merger agreement.

        Also on June 24, 2016, Rackspace entered into a letter agreement with Morgan Stanley for the purpose described above.

        On June 27, 2016, a draft merger agreement was distributed to Apollo, Party B and Party C.

        On July 1, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace management,
and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed ongoing due
diligence with Apollo, Party B and Party C.

        Also on July 1, 2016, Apollo submitted a revised preliminary, non-binding indication of interest for an acquisition of Rackspace at
$30 to $33 per share, which included initial comments to the draft merger agreement. Party B declined to submit a revised preliminary,
non-binding indication of interest, but stated that it continued to be interested in exploring an acquisition of Rackspace at the same range
of $29 to $32 per share. Party B noted that such range was contingent on additional due diligence, including engagement of third-party
consultants. Party C submitted a revised preliminary, non-binding indication of interest for an acquisition of Rackspace at $24 per share.

        On July 5, 2016, the Rackspace Board met, with members of Rackspace management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and
Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Rackspace Board their fiduciary
duties. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed the revised preliminary, non-binding indications of interest from Apollo and Party
C, as well as Party B's decision not to submit a revised preliminary, non-binding indication of interest at that time. The representatives of
Goldman Sachs discussed certain financial aspects of the proposals made by Apollo and Party C. The representatives of Goldman Sachs
discussed the nature of the additional due diligence that Party B wished to conduct. The Rackspace Board determined to (1) proceed with
negotiating a definitive merger agreement with Apollo; (2) continue to engage with Party B in an effort to secure a revised preliminary,
non-binding indication of interest from Party B; and (3) inform Party C that its proposal did not represent adequate value. The Rackspace
Board instructed Goldman Sachs to rigorously enforce the message to Apollo, Party B and Party C that there was a clear path for any of
them to acquire Rackspace so long as they proposed a transaction that was attractive to the Rackspace Board.

        On July 6, 2016, representatives of Wilson Sonsini spoke with representatives of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP
(which we refer to as "Paul Weiss"), legal counsel to Apollo, to discuss the initial comments to the merger agreement.

        On July 8, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace management,
and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an update on the
status of discussions with Apollo, Party B and Party C.

        On July 15, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed
with the members of the Transactions Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an update on the
status of discussions with Apollo and Party B.

        Also on July 15, 2016, Paul Weiss on behalf of Apollo, provided comprehensive comments to the merger agreement to Wilson
Sonsini.

        From July 15, 2016, until August 25, 2016, representatives of Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of Rackspace and at the direction and under
the oversight of the Transactions Committee, and representatives of Paul Weiss on behalf of Apollo, negotiated the terms of the merger
agreement. The key items of negotiation were (1) the length of the debt marketing period during which Apollo could secure the debt
financing necessary to complete the acquisition of Rackspace; (2) the terms of the nonsolicitation provisions, including the "match right"
periods; (3) the amount of the termination fee payable by each of, and the circumstances under which such fees would be payable by,
Rackspace and Apollo in connection with a termination of the merger agreement; (4) remedies in connection with the non-consummation
of the transaction; and (5) the treatment of equity awards held by Rackspace employees. During this period, Mr. Weston and
representatives of Apollo negotiated the terms of the voting agreement.

        On July 21, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs informed
the members of the Transactions Committee that (1) Apollo was proposing to acquire Rackspace for $31.75 per share, which amount was
inside its indicated range of $30 to $33 per share; and (2) Party B had orally reaffirmed its indicative price range of $29 to $32 per share to
acquire Rackspace but needed at least an additional five weeks to complete its due diligence. The members of the Transactions Committee
considered the status of the process to explore a possible acquisition of Rackspace. They also weighed the benefits and risks of seeking a
price increase from Apollo, particularly as it related to the possibility that Apollo would not increase its offer, would terminate acquisition
discussions or both. At the direction of the Transactions Committee, Goldman Sachs made a counterproposal of $32.75 per share to
Apollo.

        On July 26, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. With the representatives of Wilson Sonsini, the
members of the Transactions Committee discussed the status of negotiations of the merger agreement with Apollo. The Transactions
Committee provided input on the terms of the merger agreement and instructed Wilson Sonsini to work to finalize negotiations of the
merger agreement. The Transactions Committee also instructed Goldman Sachs to obtain Apollo's "best and final" price for a potential
acquisition of Rackspace.

        On July 29, 2016, Apollo increased its proposal to acquire Rackspace to $32.00 per share.

        Later on July 29, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. After describing the terms of Apollo's $32.00 per
share acquisition proposal, the representatives of Goldman Sachs stated that they did not believe that Apollo would further increase its
proposal. The representatives of Goldman Sachs also described the terms of the voting agreement that Apollo would require from
Mr. Weston. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed the major open points in the merger agreement. The Transactions Committee
instructed Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs to continue to negotiate the terms of a potential acquisition of Rackspace by Apollo.

        In August 2016, Rackspace engaged Latham & Watkins LLP (which we refer to as "Latham") to provide additional guidance and
perspective with respect to the negotiation of a transaction.

        In early August 2016, Apollo informed Goldman Sachs, on behalf of Rackspace, that Apollo was continuing to work toward an
acquisition of Rackspace but that it would need additional time to finalize its financing for the transaction.

        On August 1, 2016, Goldman Sachs provided the Rackspace Board with a letter detailing certain relationships between Goldman
Sachs, on the one hand, and Apollo and its affiliates, on the other hand. For more information on these relationships, see the section of this
proxy statement captioned "—Fairness Opinion of Goldman Sachs."

        On August 4, 2016, various news reports speculated that Rackspace was the subject of a potential acquisition transaction. Following
these reports, no parties other than Apollo, Party B and Party C contacted Rackspace to initiate discussions regarding a potential
acquisition.

        On August 5, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The members of the Transactions Committee
discussed (1) the news reports speculating that Rackspace was the subject of a potential acquisition transaction; and (2) Apollo's need for
additional time to finalize its financing. The representatives of Goldman Sachs stated that, following the news reports on August 4, 2016,
both Party B and Party C contacted Goldman Sachs about the status of a potential acquisition of Rackspace and their ability to continue to
participate in the sale process. Goldman Sachs informed both Party B and Party C that an opportunity remained to acquire Rackspace.

        On August 9, 2016, Apollo sent Goldman Sachs a letter reiterating its continued interest in acquiring Rackspace and informing
Goldman Sachs, on behalf of Rackspace, that Apollo was still working to solidify its financing. Apollo estimated that it could conclude
that process in approximately three weeks (or potentially sooner).

        Later on August 9, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini, Latham and Goldman Sachs in attendance. Representatives of Goldman Sachs
provided the members of the Transactions Committee with an update, including that (1) Apollo was continuing to work to finalize its
financing; (2) Party B remained interested in a potential acquisition of Rackspace but required additional due diligence; and (3) Party C
remained interested in a potential acquisition of Rackspace but understood that its proposed price was not presently attractive to the
Rackspace Board.

        On August 12, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini, Latham and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs
provided an update on the status of discussions with Apollo, Party B and Party C.

        Between August 15, 2016, and August 18, 2016, members of Rackspace management met with representatives of Party B and Party C
to update them on the status of Rackspace's business.

        On August 18, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini, Latham and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs
provided an update on the status of discussions with Apollo, Party B and Party C.

        On August 22, 2016, representatives of Goldman Sachs spoke with representatives of Party C. During this discussion, the
representatives of Party C stated that Party C could potentially consider an acquisition of Rackspace for $26.00 per share.

        Later on August 22, 2016, Apollo informed Rackspace that Apollo was in the process of finalizing its financing and that Searchlight
Capital Partners, L.P. and others would be making equity investments in the acquired company, but that Apollo would remain committed
to make the full amount of equity investment required to consummate the contemplated transaction. Apollo stated that it was ready to
resume negotiation of the merger agreement. Apollo did not propose any modification to its acquisition proposal of $32.00 per share.
Following this, representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Paul Weiss negotiated the final terms of the merger agreement.

        On August 24, 2016, the Transactions Committee met, with other members of the Rackspace Board, members of Rackspace
management, and representatives of Wilson Sonsini, Latham and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini
discussed with the members of the Transactions Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed certain
financial aspects of the $32.00 per share proposal made by Apollo. The members of the Transactions Committee discussed the status of
Party B's and Party C's consideration of a potential acquisition of Rackspace. With respect to Party B, the members of the Transactions
Committee noted that (1) Apollo's acquisition proposal of $32.00 per share was at the top end of the range of $29 to $32 per share
previously proposed by Party B; (2) Party B had not provided a revised preliminary, non-binding indication of interest; (3) Party B
required additional due diligence; and (4) Party B had not negotiated any of the terms of a definitive merger agreement. With respect to
Party C, the members of the Transactions Committee noted that Party C's acquisition proposal of $26 per share was $6 lower than the price
proposed by Apollo. The members of the Transactions Committee concluded to recommend to the Rackspace Board that it accept the
acquisition proposal from Apollo.

        On August 25, 2016, the Rackspace Board met, with members of Rackspace management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini,
Latham and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Transactions
Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed Goldman Sachs' financial analysis of Apollo's proposal.
The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed the terms of the merger agreement. Rackspace management and Goldman Sachs informed
the Rackspace Board that Apollo was in the process of finalizing its financing and this process was expected to be completed within a few
hours. The Transactions Committee provided its recommendation to the Rackspace Board that the Rackspace Board accept the acquisition
proposal from Apollo. The Rackspace Board agreed to reconvene later in the evening.

        Later on August 25, 2016, the Rackspace Board met, with members of Rackspace management and representatives of Wilson
Sonsini, Latham and Goldman Sachs in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Transactions
Committee their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed certain financial aspects of the $32.00 per share
acquisition proposal made by Apollo. Following this presentation, the representatives of Goldman Sachs rendered Goldman Sachs' opinion
to the Rackspace Board, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of August 25, 2016, and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth in Goldman Sachs' opinion, the $32.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than

Parent and its affiliates) of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders of
common stock. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "—Fairness Opinion of Goldman Sachs." The
members of the Rackspace Board discussed potential reasons for and against entering into the merger. After this discussion, the Rackspace
Board, after considering the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, unanimously (1) determined that the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of
Rackspace and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement. The Rackspace Board authorized Rackspace management to sign the merger agreement prior to the opening of
trading of the common stock on the NYSE on August 26, 2016.

        On August 26, 2016, prior to the opening of trading of the common stock on the NYSE, Rackspace, Parent and Merger Sub signed
the merger agreement, and Mr. Weston and Parent and Merger Sub signed the voting agreement. Rackspace then issued a press release
announcing the entry into the merger agreement.

Recommendation of the Rackspace Board and Reasons for the Merger 

Recommendation of the Rackspace Board

        The Rackspace Board has unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Rackspace and its stockholders; and
(2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        The Rackspace Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) "FOR"
the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; (3) "FOR" the compensation that will or may
become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (4) "FOR" the acceleration of
vesting of certain equity awards held by Rackspace's non-employee directors.

Reasons for the Merger

        In evaluating the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Rackspace
Board consulted with Rackspace management, its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel. In recommending that Rackspace
stockholders vote for the adoption of the merger agreement, the Rackspace Board considered a number of factors, including the following
(which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

• Rackspace's business operations, business strategy, competitive position and management execution performance. 

• Rackspace's historical and projected financial performance, results and condition, including the risks associated with
achieving the Forecasts (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned "—Financial Forecasts"). 

• The all-cash merger consideration, which will provide certainty of value to Rackspace stockholders, while eliminating the
effect of long-term business and execution risk. 

• The oral opinion delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Rackspace Board on August 25, 2016, and subsequently confirmed in
writing, that as of August 25, 2016, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions, considerations, limitations and
other matters set forth therein, the $32.00

per share merger consideration to be received by Rackspace stockholders (other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to
the merger agreement, in their capacity as holders of common stock, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "—Fairness Opinion of Goldman Sachs").

• The relationship of the $32.00 per share merger consideration to the trading price of the common stock, including that the
$32.00 per share merger consideration constituted a premium of approximately 38% to the closing price of the common
stock on August 3, 2016, the last trading day prior to news reports speculating that Rackspace was the subject of a potential
acquisition transaction. 

• The reports of the Transactions Committee received by the Rackspace Board regarding the process conducted by the
Transactions Committee. 

• The Transactions Committee's unanimous recommendation of the merger to the Rackspace Board. 

• The Rackspace Board's belief that $32.00 per share in cash and the terms of the merger agreement and the related
agreements offer the best value reasonably attainable for Rackspace stockholders and offer full and fair value for
Rackspace. As part of this, the Rackspace Board considered, among other matters, that: 

• Only Apollo submitted to Rackspace fully negotiated equity commitment letters and debt commitments and
required no additional time for due diligence, negotiation with financing sources or negotiation and finalization of
definitive documentation. 

• Party B's last proposal indicated a range of $29 to $32 per share and required additional time for Party B to conduct
due diligence and to finalize its financing arrangements and definitive documentation. 

• Party C's last proposal was for $26.00 per share. 

• After the news reports on August 4, 2016, speculating that Rackspace was the subject of a potential acquisition
transaction, no parties other than Apollo, Party B and Party C contacted Rackspace to initiate discussions regarding
a potential acquisition. 

• Prolonging the sale process could have resulted in the loss of a favorable opportunity to successfully consummate a
transaction on favorable terms. 

• The benefits and risks associated with alternative strategies for certain products or services currently under
evaluation, the timing and outcome of which are presently uncertain. 

• The Rackspace Board's view that the merger agreement was the product of arm's-length negotiation and contained
customary terms and conditions. 

• The terms of the merger agreement, including: 

• Rackspace's ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third
parties regarding unsolicited acquisition proposals. 

• The Rackspace Board's view that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third parties from
making a superior proposal, including the merger agreement's terms and conditions as they relate to the ability of
the Rackspace Board to make recommendation changes. For more information, see the sections of this proxy
statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers" and "The Merger Agreement—The
Rackspace Board's Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change."

• Rackspace's ability to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept an unsolicited superior proposal, subject to
paying Parent a termination fee of $112 million and compliance with certain other terms of the merger agreement. 

• The Rackspace Board's belief that the termination fee of $112 million, which is approximately 2.6% of Rackspace's
implied equity value in the merger, is reasonable, consistent with or below fees in comparable transactions, and not
preclusive of other offers. 

• Rackspace's entitlement to a termination fee from Parent and Merger Sub of $253 million, which is approximately
5.9% of Rackspace's implied equity value in the merger, if the merger is not consummated in certain circumstances.

• Rackspace's entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger agreement. 

• Parent's commitment in the merger agreement to use reasonable best efforts to arrange its financing. 

• That the consummation of the merger is not subject to any financing condition. 

• The terms of the other principal agreements entered into in connection with the merger, including: 

• The terms of the equity commitments letter and that Rackspace is a named third party beneficiary in the equity
commitment letter. 

• Rackspace's ability, subject to certain conditions, to seek specific performance of the Apollo Funds' obligation to
make the equity contributions pursuant to the equity commitment letter. 

• The limited guarantee in favor of Rackspace guarantees the payment of certain liabilities and obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub under the merger agreement, including the $253 million termination fee potentially payable by
Parent and Merger Sub. 

• Potential acquirers of Rackspace and various considerations associated with each such acquirer. 

• Rackspace's competitive positioning and prospects as a standalone company, including the perceived risk of continuing as a
standalone public company. In that regard, the following were considered: 

• The intensely competitive nature of the market for dedicated hosting, cloud computing and managed services. 

• The increased competition in the cloud computing market experienced by Rackspace from significantly larger and
better capitalized competitors that, among other things, use pricing policies, research and development resources,
and other advantages of scale, and produce a vast number of differentiated products, to win business. 

• The rapidly changing technology in the cloud computing industry and evolving industry standards, both of which
could challenge the relevance and attractiveness of Rackspace's existing services or technologies. 

• That although Rackspace is engaged in the process of evaluating its various products and services, and is engaged
in considering related discussions regarding potential acquisitions, divestitures, partnerships and other commercial
relationships with cloud providers and other third parties, the outcome and timing of those evaluations and
discussions are uncertain. Pursuing any alternatives under evaluation or discussion could result in substantial

disruption to Rackspace's relationships with, among others, its customers and employees, as well as significant and
sustained financial disruption or volatility to Rackspace.

• The Rackspace Board's fiduciary duties to Rackspace stockholders under Delaware law.

        The Rackspace Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the merger, including the following (which
factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

• The potential impact of the announcement and pendency of the merger, or the failure to complete the merger, all of which
may cause substantial harm to Rackspace's relationships with its employees (including making it more difficult to attract
and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key management, technical, sales and other personnel), vendors and
customers, and may divert employees' attention away from Rackspace's day-to-day business operations. 

• That Rackspace stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of Rackspace and will not benefit from
any appreciation in value of Rackspace, including any appreciation in value that could be realized as a result of the
acquisition of Rackspace by the Apollo Funds. 

• The requirement that Rackspace pay Parent a termination fee of $112 million under certain circumstances following
termination of the merger agreement, including if the Rackspace Board terminates the merger agreement to accept an
unsolicited superior proposal. 

• The restrictions on the conduct of Rackspace's business prior to the consummation of the merger, including the requirement
that Rackspace conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent
Rackspace from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the merger and that, absent the
merger agreement, Rackspace might have pursued. 

• That an all-cash transaction would be taxable to Rackspace stockholders that are U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. 

• That under the terms of the merger agreement, Rackspace is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the
pendency of the merger. 

• The significant costs involved in connection with entering into the merger agreement and completing the merger, and the
substantial time and effort of Rackspace management required to complete the merger, which may disrupt Rackspace's
business operations. 

• That the completion of the merger will require antitrust clearance in the United States and regulatory approval from the
European Union and Israel. 

• That the termination fee payable by Parent and Merger Sub will not be available in all instances in which the merger
agreement is terminated. 

• The other potential alternatives strategies available to Rackspace, some of which could result in a more successful and
valuable company. In that regard, the following were considered: 

• The increasingly less competitive market for dedicated hosting as telecommunication companies exit their
dedicated hosting, private cloud and managed services businesses. 

• That Rackspace could develop new products and services that would allow it to better compete with larger
competitors in the cloud computing market. 

• The potential that Rackspace's ongoing process of evaluating its various products and services, and its consideration
of related discussions regarding potential acquisitions, divestitures, partnerships and other commercial relationships
with cloud providers and other third parties, could result in decisions to alter Rackspace's strategy. Such decisions
could result in a company that is more focused, has a lower cost structure and is ultimately better

positioned for competitive success. Although any of the alternatives under consideration could result in an increase in the
value of the common stock over time, Rackspace determined that the outcome and timing of such evaluations and
discussions are uncertain.

• That Rackspace's directors and officers may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those
of other Rackspace stockholders (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "—Interests of Rackspace's
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger").

        This discussion is not meant to be exhaustive, but summarizes the material factors considered by the Rackspace Board in its
consideration of the merger. After considering these and other factors, the Rackspace Board concluded that the potential benefits of the
merger outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In view of the variety of factors considered by the Rackspace Board and the complexity of
these factors, the Rackspace Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing
factors in reaching its determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Rackspace Board applied his or her own
personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different weights to different factors. The Rackspace Board
unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
and recommended that Rackspace stockholders adopt the merger agreement based upon the totality of the information presented to and
considered by the Rackspace Board.

Fairness Opinion of Goldman Sachs 

        Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Rackspace Board that, as of August 26, 2016, and based upon and subject to the factors
and assumptions set forth therein, the $32.00 in cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its
affiliates) of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated August 26, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B. Goldman
Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the Rackspace Board in connection with its consideration of the merger.
The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of common stock should vote with respect to the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement or any other matter.

        In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed,
among other things:

• the merger agreement; 

• annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Rackspace for the five fiscal years ended
December 31, 2015; 

• certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Rackspace; 

• certain other communications from Rackspace to its stockholders; 

• certain publicly available research analyst reports for Rackspace; and 

• the Forecasts, prepared by Rackspace management, as approved for Goldman Sachs' use by Rackspace.

        Goldman Sachs also (1) held discussions with members of the senior management of Rackspace regarding their assessment of the
past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Rackspace; (2) reviewed the reported price and trading
activity for shares of common stock; (3) compared certain financial and stock market information for Rackspace with similar

information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; (4) reviewed the financial terms of certain recent
business combinations in the data center industry, technology infrastructure industry and other industries; and (5) performed such other
studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with Rackspace's consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by it,
without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with Rackspace's
consent that the Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of
Rackspace management. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any
contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries and it was not furnished with
any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for
the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the merger in any way meaningful
to its analysis. Goldman Sachs has also assumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement,
without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

        Goldman Sachs' opinion does not address the underlying business decision of Rackspace to engage in the merger or the relative
merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to Rackspace; nor does it address any legal, regulatory,
tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs' opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than
Parent and its affiliates) of common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the $32.00 in cash per share to be paid to such holders pursuant
to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs' opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the
merger agreement or the merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or
entered into or amended in connection with the merger, including the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection
therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Rackspace; nor as to the fairness of the
amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Rackspace, or class of such
persons in connection with the merger, whether relative to the $32.00 in cash per share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its
affiliates) of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the impact
of the merger on the solvency or viability of Rackspace, Parent or Merger Sub or the ability of Rackspace, Parent or Merger Sub to pay
their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs' opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary market and other
conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no
responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of
its opinion. Goldman Sachs' opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Rackspace Board in connection
with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the
financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to
those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The
tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs' financial
analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on
market data as it existed on or before August 25, 2016, the last trading day before the meeting of the Rackspace Board that approved the
merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Historical Stock Trading Analysis

        Goldman Sachs reviewed historical trading prices and volumes for shares of common stock. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the
consideration to be paid to holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement in relation to (1) the closing price per
share of common stock on August 25, 2016, the last trading day before the meeting of the Rackspace Board that approved the merger;
(2) the closing price per share of common stock on August 3, 2016, the last trading day prior to news reports speculating that Rackspace
was the subject of a potential acquisition transaction; (3) the volume weighted average price per share of common stock (which we refer to
as "VWAP") for the preceding five-day, twenty-day and thirty-day periods ended August 3, 2016; and (4) the high and low trading prices
per share of common stock over the one-year period ended August 3, 2016. This analysis indicated that the price per share of common
stock to be paid to Rackspace stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement represented:

• a premium of 6.0% based on the closing price per share of common stock of $30.19 on August 25, 2016; 

• a premium of 38.2% based on the closing price per share of common stock of $23.16 on August 3, 2016; 

• a premium of 38.1% based on five-day VWAP of $23.17; 

• a premium of 39.6% based on the twenty-day VWAP of $22.93; 

• a premium of 44.5% based on the thirty-day VWAP of $22.14; 

• a discount of 6.0% based on $34.03, the highest trading price per share of common stock over the one-year period ended
August 3, 2016; and 

• a premium of 90.9% based on $16.76, the lowest trading price per share of common stock over the one-year period ended
August 3, 2016.

Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis

        Goldman Sachs performed illustrative analyses of the implied present value of the future price per share, which were designed to
provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a company's equity as a function of (1) the company's estimated
forward free cash flow yield (which we refer to as "Forward FCF Yield") and an assumed price to forward FCF Yield per share multiple
and (2) Rackspace's Enterprise Value (which is defined as the equity value, calculated using the number of fully diluted shares of common
stock, as provided by Rackspace management, plus total debt, less total cash and cash equivalents) (which we refer to as "EV") as a one
year forward multiple of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned "—Financial Forecasts"), and
which multiple we refer to as "Forward EV/EBITDA"). For these analyses, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years
2016 to 2019 and the number of fully diluted shares as provided to Goldman Sachs by Rackspace management. Goldman Sachs first
calculated illustrative implied future equity values per share of common stock at year-end for each of the years 2016 to 2019 using the
FCF Yield per share set forth in the Forecasts for those years by calculating a Forward FCF Yield range using a Forward FCF yield range
of 5.5% to 8.5%. Goldman Sachs then discounted the implied year-end 2016 to 2019 equity values back to August 3, 2016, using an
illustrative discount rate of 11.79%, reflecting an estimate of Rackspace's cost of equity. In addition, Goldman Sachs calculated illustrative
implied future equity values per share of common stock at year-end for each of the years 2016 through 2019 using the next-twelve month
Adjusted EBITDA set forth in the Forecasts for those years by applying Forward EV/EBITDA multiples ranging from 3.8x to 5.5x to the
applicable next-twelve month Adjusted EBITDA Forecasts. Goldman Sachs then discounted the implied

Table of Contents

year-end 2016 to 2019 equity values back to August 3, 2016, using an illustrative discount rate of 11.79%, reflecting an estimate of
Rackspace's cost of equity.

        This analysis indicated the following illustrative ranges of implied present values per share of common stock:

        Goldman Sachs then compared the merger consideration of $32.00 per share to the illustrative ranges of implied present values per
share of common stock derived from such analyses as of year-end 2018, which were:

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on Rackspace. Using discount rates
ranging from 9.5% to 11.00%, reflecting estimates of Rackspace's weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present
value as of June 30, 2016, (1) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Rackspace for the years 2016 through 2020 as reflected in the
Forecasts; and (2) a range of the terminal values for Rackspace, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from
1.00% to 3.00% to a terminal year estimate of the free cash flow to be generated by Rackspace, as reflected in the Forecasts. Goldman
Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Rackspace by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman
Sachs then subtracted the amount by which Rackspace's indebtedness exceeded its cash as of June 30, 2016, as provided by Rackspace
management, from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for Rackspace to derive a range of illustrative equity values for
Rackspace. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares
of Rackspace, as provided by Rackspace management, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share of common stock ranging
from $23.67 to $35.37.

Selected Historical Premia Analysis

        Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available data, those acquisition premia based on the trading price on
August 3, 2016, the last trading day prior to news reports speculating that Rackspace was the subject of a potential acquisition transaction
for all-cash acquisition transactions globally with disclosed Enterprise Values between $2 billion and $5 billion for each year from 2006 to
2016 through August 3, 2016. The results of this analysis showed average annual acquisition premia ranging from a low of 11.8% (for the
year 2013) to a high of 51.1% (for the year 2009) with an overall annual median of 23%.            

        As a result of the review by Goldman Sachs of the implied premia for the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs applied the
illustrative premia ranging from 12.0% to 51% to the closing price per share of common stock on August 3, 2016, the last trading day prior
to news reports speculating that Rackspace was the subject of a potential acquisition transaction, and derived an illustrative range of
implied values per share of common stock ranging from $25.89 to $35.00.

        The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create
an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs
considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results
of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Rackspace or the
transaction.

        Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Rackspace Board as to the fairness from a
financial point of view of the $32.00 in cash per share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject
to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of
Rackspace, Parent, Apollo Management, Goldman Sachs, any of their affiliates or any other person assumes responsibility if future results
are materially different from those forecast.

        The merger consideration was determined through arm's-length negotiations between Rackspace and Apollo, and was approved by
the Rackspace Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Rackspace during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however,
recommend any specific amount of consideration to Rackspace or the Rackspace Board or that any specific amount of consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

        As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion to the Rackspace Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the
Rackspace Board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B.

        Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,
investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and
its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which
they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans,
commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of Rackspace, Parent or any of their respective affiliates and
third parties, including Apollo Management, an affiliate of Parent and any of its affiliates and portfolio companies, or any currency or
commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to
Rackspace in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the transaction. Goldman Sachs expects to receive
fees for its services in connection with the transaction, the principal portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the transaction,
and Rackspace has agreed to reimburse certain of its expenses arising, and indemnify Goldman Sachs against certain liabilities that may
arise, out of its engagement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Rackspace and/or its
affiliates from time to time for which its Investment Banking Division has received, and may receive, compensation, including having
acted as book runner with respect to the issuance of its 6.500% senior notes due 2024 (aggregate principal amount $500 million) in
November 2015. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to AGM and/or its affiliates and
portfolio companies from time to time for which its Investment Banking Division has received, and

may receive, compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to Athlon Energy, a portfolio company of funds affiliated with
AGM, in connection with its sale in November 2014; as co-manager with respect to the offering by Protection One, Inc. and ASG Security,
portfolio companies of funds affiliated with AGM, of first and second lien term loan facilities (aggregate principal amount $1.355 billion)
in May 2015; as financial advisor to AGM in connection with the sale of Great Wolf Resorts, a portfolio company of funds affiliated with
AGM, in May 2015; as joint bookrunner with respect to the issuance by EP Energy LLC, a portfolio company of funds affiliated with
AGM, of its 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (aggregate principal amount $800 million) in July 2015; as financial advisor to Gala
Coral Group Limited, a portfolio company of funds affiliated with AGM, in connection with its pending merger announced in July 2015;
and as joint bookrunner with respect to the issuance by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Limited, a portfolio company of funds affiliated
with AGM, of its 4.625% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (aggregate principal amount $600 million) in November 2015. According to
Goldman Sachs, during the two year period ended August 26, 2016, Goldman Sachs has received compensation for financial advisory
and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division directly to AGM and/or to its affiliates and portfolio companies
(which may include companies that are not controlled by AGM) of approximately $38.6 million. Goldman Sachs may also in the future
provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Rackspace, Parent and their respective affiliates and AGM and its affiliates and
portfolio companies, for which its Investment Banking Division may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman Sachs also may have
co-invested with AGM and its affiliates from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of AGM from
time to time and may do so in the future.

        The Rackspace Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger and its prior experience working with Rackspace. Pursuant to a
letter agreement dated August 3, 2015, Rackspace engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger.
The engagement letter between Rackspace and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information
available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $25 million, approximately $500,000 of which was paid prior to the execution
of the merger agreement, and the remainder of which is contingent upon, and will be paid at, consummation of the merger. In addition,
Rackspace has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, and to
indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Financial Forecasts 

        Although Rackspace does not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to its future financial performance, Rackspace
provided certain prospective financial information to Apollo, Party B and Party C. In addition, based on certain estimates and assumptions
of Rackspace management, the Rackspace Board considered certain other estimates and assumptions regarding Rackspace. We refer to this
prospective financial information for 2016 to 2020 as the "Forecasts." Rackspace also provided the Forecasts to Goldman Sachs.

        The Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States (which refer to as "GAAP"). In addition, they were not prepared with a view toward complying with the guidelines
established by the SEC, or by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information. In
the opinion of Rackspace management, the Forecasts (1) were prepared on a reasonable basis; (2) reflect the best currently available
estimates and judgments; and (3) present, to the best of Rackspace management's knowledge, the expected course of action and the
expected future financial performance of Rackspace. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being
necessarily indicative of future results. Readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not

to place undue reliance on the Forecasts. The Forecasts do not reflect the potential impact of each of the potential acquisitions,
divestitures, partnerships and other commercial relationships with cloud providers and other third parties, that were under consideration
and the outcome of which were uncertain at the time that the Rackspace Board voted to recommend the merger agreement. Discussions
regarding certain of these transactions are expected to continue prior to and after the stockholder vote on the merger agreement.

        Neither Rackspace's independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have (1) compiled,
reviewed, audited, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Forecasts; (2) expressed any opinion or any other form of
assurance on such information or the achievability of such information; or (3) assumed any responsibility for the Forecasts. Rackspace's
independent registered public accounting firm disclaims any association with the Forecasts.

        Readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the specific portions of the Forecasts set forth below.
The Forecasts are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause Rackspace's future results to materially vary, see
the section of this proxy statement captioned "Forward-Looking Statements." Although the Forecasts are presented with numerical
specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future events made by Rackspace management that Rackspace
management believed were reasonable at the time that the Forecasts were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available
to Rackspace management at the time. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative
of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Forecasts not to be achieved include (1) general
economic conditions; (2) the accuracy of certain accounting assumptions; (3) changes in actual or projected cash flows; (4) competitive
pressures; and (5) changes in tax laws. In addition, the Forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the
date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Forecasts will be realized,
and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Forecasts. The inclusion of this information should not be
regarded as an indication that the Rackspace Board, Rackspace or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the
Forecasts to be predictive of actual future results. The Forecasts are not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any Rackspace
stockholder to vote in favor of any proposal to be considered at the special meeting. Rackspace does not intend to update or otherwise
revise the Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in
the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Forecasts are shown to be in error or no longer appropriate.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

        Adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of this financial information is
not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in
accordance with GAAP. Rackspace uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means
to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Rackspace believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, among other things, (1) provide
useful information about operating results; (2) enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects; and
(3) allow

Table of Contents

for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by Rackspace management in its financial and operational decision making. The
non-GAAP financial measures included in the Forecasts are defined and reconciled to GAAP financial measures below.

        Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (1) plus: income taxes, total other (income) expense, depreciation and amortization, and
non-cash charges for share-based compensation; and (2) less: gain on sale.

        EBITDA is defined as net income plus: income taxes, total other (income) expense, and depreciation and amortization.

        Rackspace included Adjusted EBITDA in the Forecasts because it is a key measure used by Rackspace management and the
Rackspace Board to, among other things, (1) understand and evaluate Rackspace's core operating performance and trends; (2) prepare and
approve Rackspace's annual budget; and (3) develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses
in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Rackspace's core business.
Accordingly, Rackspace believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating Rackspace's
projections in the same manner as Rackspace management and the Rackspace Board.

        Unlevered cash flow is defined as EBITDA (1) minus: capital expenditures and taxes; and (2) plus change in net working capital and
gain on sale.

        Unlevered cash flow provides another measure by which to evaluate Rackspace's core operating performance and trends.

        Rackspace's use of non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow, has limitations as an
analytical tool, and you should not consider any non-GAAP financial measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as
reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (1) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being
depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and our non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect cash capital
expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (2) our non-GAAP financial measures do not
reflect gains or losses on divestitures; (3) our non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for,
Rackspace's working capital needs; (4) our non-GAAP financial measures do not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based
compensation; and (5) our non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to
us. Other companies, including companies in Rackspace's industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures
differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure.

        Because of these limitations, you should consider our non-GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures,
including various cash flow metrics, net income and our other GAAP results.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

        The Forecasts include a forecast of Rackspace's net revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow. The following tables
present the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and unlevered cash flow. Other than in connection with the preparation of this proxy

Interests of Rackspace's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        When considering the recommendation of the Rackspace Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement,
you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of Rackspace stockholders generally, as more fully described below. The Rackspace Board was aware of and considered these
interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and the merger and
recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by Rackspace's stockholders.

Treatment of Equity-Based Awards

Treatment of Company Options

        As of the record date, there were 431,224 outstanding company options held by our directors and executive officers, of which 181,639
have an exercise price below the per share merger consideration.

        At the effective time of the merger, each company option outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive the option consideration less any applicable
withholding taxes. If the per share exercise price of any company option, whether vested or unvested, is equal to or greater than the per
share merger consideration, such company option will be cancelled as of the effective time of the merger without any cash payment and
will have no further effect.

Treatment of Company Stock-Based Awards

        As of the record date, there were 1,518,207 outstanding RSUs held by our directors and executive officers. Our directors and officers
do not hold any other type of company stock-based award.

        At the effective time of the merger, each company stock-based award outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, to the extent vested (which generally includes unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards that are otherwise scheduled to
vest by their terms on or before December 31, 2016, as discussed in the following paragraph) and, if applicable, unexercised, will be
cancelled and converted into the company stock-based award consideration less any applicable withholding taxes.

        At the effective time, each unvested time-vesting company stock-based award will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the company stock-based award consideration in respect of such unvested time-vesting
company stock-based award, generally payable in semi-annual installments following the effective time of the merger depending on the
original vesting schedule of the corresponding company stock-based award and the title (as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger) of the holder of such award, as follows:

Senior Vice President and Above 

Vice President and Below 

        Unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards that are scheduled to vest by their terms on or before December 31, 2016,

merger and will be subject to the vested stock-based award treatment rather than the unvested stock-based award treatment.

        With respect to each performance company stock-based award that was granted (1) after August 22, 2013, the applicable performance
metrics will be deemed to have been satisfied as to 100% of the target number of shares of common stock subject to such performance
company stock-based award as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, regardless of when the performance period ends,
with each such performance company stock-based award granted (a) prior to December 1, 2015, subject to the vested stock-based award
treatment; and (b) on or after December 1, 2015, subject to the unvested stock-based award treatment; and (2) on August 22, 2013, such
performance company stock-based award will be treated in accordance with its terms.

        The receipt of the company stock-based award consideration in respect of such unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards
and unvested performance company stock-based awards, in each case, that are subject to the unvested stock-based award treatment is
generally subject to the recipient's continued employment following the effective time of the merger, except that any then-unpaid portion
of a recipient's company stock-based award consideration generally will become immediately payable if such recipient's termination of
employment (whenever occurring) is either (1) without Cause (as defined in the 2007 LTIP); or (2) for Good Reason (as defined in either
(a) the Severance Plan, if the recipient is a participant in the Severance Plan as of immediately prior to such employee's termination date or
(b) an effective employment agreement between such employee and Rackspace, the surviving corporation or their affiliates in all other
cases) (for the avoidance of doubt, clause (2) shall not apply to any employee who as of immediately prior to such employee's termination
of employment is neither a participant in the Severance Plan nor is party to an effective employment agreement that contains a definition
of "Good Reason"). However, before the effective time of the merger, Rackspace may provide different vesting terms for any employee
that are no more favorable to such employee than the terms described above. Any payments of stock-based award consideration in respect
of unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards and unvested performance company stock-based awards will be subject to any
applicable withholding taxes.

        Parent will not assume, substitute or convert any company stock-based award that is outstanding and, if applicable, unexercised, as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and that is held by a non-employee member of the Rackspace Board. Each company
stock-based award that is outstanding, and, if applicable, unexercised, as of immediately prior to the effective time and that is held by a
non-employee member of the Rackspace Board will, subject to the approval of the Rackspace stockholders (excluding, for this purpose,
any shares of common stock beneficially held by such non-employee members of the Rackspace Board) be fully vested as of immediately
prior to the effective time and will be subject to the vested stock-based award treatment.

Equity Interests of Rackspace's Executive Officers and Non-Employee Directors

        Based on information available to Rackspace as of the date of this proxy statement, the following table sets forth for each Rackspace
executive officer and director, as of December 1, 2016, (1) the number of shares of common stock held; (2) the number of shares subject to
outstanding company options with an exercise price less than $32.00 per share; (3) the number of shares subject to company stock-based
awards that will vest upon the merger, assuming that Rackspace does not provide vesting terms for any executive officer that are different
from those described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards;" and (4) the
number of shares subject to company stock-based awards that will vest in connection with a qualifying termination of employment
following the effective time of the merger, assuming that Rackspace does not provide vesting terms for any executive officer that are
different from those described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards." The

(Messrs. Reichheld, Costello, Harper, Weston and Moorman and Ms. Fisher and Ms. Tretikov), the vesting acceleration and cash out of these shares is
subject to stockholder approval. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "Proposal 4: Acceleration of Vesting of Certain

        On September 16, 2014, Mr. Rhodes and Rackspace entered into an employment agreement, which provides that if, within the period

Change in Control Period"), Mr. Rhodes resigns for Good Reason (as defined in Mr. Rhodes's employment agreement) or Rackspace (or
any parent or subsidiary or successor of Rackspace terminates Mr. Rhodes's employment other than for Cause (as defined in Mr. Rhodes's
employment agreement), death, or disability, then, subject to Mr. Rhodes executing a separation agreement and full general release of
claims that becomes effective and irrevocable no later than 60 days following the termination of Mr. Rhodes employment and
Mr. Rhodes's compliance with the confidential information agreement that Mr. Rhodes and Rackspace entered into in connection with
Mr. Rhodes's employment and with certain non-competition covenants in Mr. Rhodes's employment agreement, Mr. Rhodes will be
entitled to receive (1) a lump sum payment equal to 24 months of his base salary, as then in effect; (2) a lump sum payment equal to two
times his annual target bonus; and (3) reimbursement for the cost of continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (which we refer to as "COBRA") for up to 24 months (or if such reimbursements cannot be
provided without violating or being subject to an excise tax under applicable laws, a lump sum payment of $48,000 in lieu of such
reimbursements). In addition, Mr. Rhodes's employment agreement provides that, if any payment or benefits to Mr. Rhodes (including the
payments and benefits under his employment agreement) would constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Internal Revenue Code and would therefore be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then such
payments and benefits will be either (1) reduced to the largest portion of the payments and benefits that would result in no portion of the
payments and benefits being subject to the excise tax; or (2) not reduced, whichever, after taking into account all applicable federal, state
and local income taxes and the excise tax, results in his receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater payments and benefits. If Mr. Rhodes
signs a participation agreement under the Severance Plan, he will forfeit his other severance payments and benefits (including under his
employment agreement) payable during the Change of Control Period (as defined below).

        In addition, Mr. Rhodes's employment agreement provides that if, outside the Rhodes Change in Control Period, Mr. Rhodes resigns
for Good Reason or Rackspace (or any parent or subsidiary or successor of Rackspace terminates Mr. Rhodes's employment other than for
Cause, death, or disability, then, subject to Mr. Rhodes executing a separation agreement and full general release of claims that becomes
effective and irrevocable no later than 60 days following the termination of Mr. Rhodes employment and Mr. Rhodes's compliance with
the confidential information agreement that Mr. Rhodes and Rackspace entered into in connection with Mr. Rhodes's employment and with
certain non-competition covenants in Mr. Rhodes's employment agreement, Mr. Rhodes will be entitled to receive (1) continuing payments
of his base salary, as then in effect, for six months; (2) a lump sum payment equal to his annual target bonus, as in effect in Rackspace's
fiscal year in which his employment terminates; and (3) reimbursement for the cost of COBRA continuation coverage for up to six months
(or if such reimbursements cannot be provided without violating or being subject to an excise tax under applicable laws, up to six taxable
monthly payments that are each equal to the cost of the first month of COBRA continuation coverage).

        The consummation of the merger will constitute a "Change in Control" under Mr. Rhodes's employment agreement.

        Under Mr. Rhodes's employment agreement, the following definitions are used:

• "Cause" means Mr. Rhodes's (1) willful engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially injurious to
Rackspace; (2) conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, a felony or a crime of moral turpitude;
(3) engagement in fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement resulting or intended to result directly or indirectly in a gain or
substantial personal enrichment to Mr. Rhodes at the expense of Rackspace; (4) material breach of any written policies of
Rackspace (which policy or policies previously was provided to Mr. Rhodes); or (5) willful and continual failure
substantially to perform his duties with Rackspace (other than

a failure resulting from his incapacity due to physical or mental illness), which failure has continued for a period of at least
30 days.

• "Good Reason" means Mr. Rhodes's resignation within 30 days following the expiration of any Rackspace cure period
(discussed below) following the occurrence of one or more of the following, without Mr. Rhodes's express written consent: 

• a material reduction of Mr. Rhodes's duties or responsibilities, or the removal of Mr. Rhodes from his position,
either of which results in a material diminution of his authority, duties, or responsibilities, provided, however, that a
reduction in duties, position, or responsibilities solely by virtue of Rackspace being acquired and made part of a
larger entity will not constitute "Good Reason," provided that Mr. Rhodes is made Chief Executive Officer of the
combined entities; 

• a material reduction in Mr. Rhodes's base salary or target bonus (except where there is a reduction applicable to the
executive team generally); provided, however, that a reduction in Mr. Rhodes's base salary non-equity incentive
target payout level percentage of 10% or less in any one year will not be deemed a material reduction; or 

• a material change in the geographic location of Mr. Rhodes's primary work facility or location; provided, that a
relocation of less than 35 miles from Mr. Rhodes's then-present location will not be considered a material change in
geographic location.

Mr. Rhodes will not resign for Good Reason without first providing Rackspace with written notice of the acts or omissions
constituting the grounds for "Good Reason" and a reasonable cure period of not less than 30 days following the date
Rackspace receives such notice during which such condition must not have been cured.

Employment Agreement with Mark Roenigk

        On December 7, 2015, Mr. Roenigk and Rackspace entered into an employment agreement, which provides that if Mr. Roenigk's
employment is terminated without Cause (as defined in Mr. Roenigk's employment agreement) within 12 months of a Change of Control
(as defined in Mr. Roenigk's employment agreement) (we refer to this period as the "Roenigk Change in Control Period"), then, subject to
Mr. Roenigk executing a severance agreement and general release of claims and not competing with Rackspace or being hired or engaged
in any capacity by any competitor of Rackspace, Mr. Roenigk will receive salary continuation for the greater of 12 months or the
remaining period of his employment agreement term (which is scheduled to end on December 6, 2018). If Mr. Roenigk signs a
participation agreement under the Severance Plan, he will forfeit his other severance payments and benefits (including under his
employment agreement) payable during the Change of Control Period (as defined below).

        In addition, Mr. Roenigk's employment agreement provides that if Mr. Roenigk's employment is terminated outside of the Roenigk
Change in Control Period either (1) by Rackspace other than for Cause, death, disability, or non-renewal of Mr. Roenigk's employment
agreement; or (2) by Mr. Roenigk for Good Reason (as defined in Mr. Roenigk's employment agreement), then, subject to Mr. Roenigk
executing a severance agreement and general release of claims, Mr. Roenigk will receive salary continuation for 12 months.

        Any severance payments under Mr. Roenigk's employment agreement will cease if Mr. Roenigk competes with Rackspace or is hired
or engaged in any capacity by any competitor of Rackspace.

        The consummation of the merger will constitute a "Change of Control" under Mr. Roenigk's employment agreement.

Table of Contents

        Under Mr. Roenigk's employment agreement, the following definitions are used:

• "Cause" means: 

• willful misconduct, including, without limitation, violation of sexual or other harassment policy, gross negligence,
misappropriation of or material misrepresentation regarding property of Rackspace, other than customary and de
minimis use of Rackspace property for personal purposes, as determined in the discretion of Rackspace, or failure
to take reasonable and appropriate action to prevent material injury to the financial condition, business, or

• "Good Reason" means (1) Rackspace's repeated failure to comply with a material term of Mr. Roenigk's employment
agreement after written notice by Mr. Roenigk specifying the alleged failure; or (2) a substantial and unusual reduction in
responsibilities and authority. If Mr. Roenigk elects to terminate his employment for Good Reason, he must first provide
Rackspace with written notice within 30 days, after which Rackspace will have 60 days to cure. If Rackspace has not cured
and Mr. Roenigk elects to terminate his employment, he must do so within 10 days after the end of the cure period.

Employment Agreement with Scott Crenshaw

coverage for 12 months. If Mr. Pinchev signs a participation agreement under the Severance Plan, he will forfeit his other severance
payments and benefits (including under his employment agreement) payable during the Change of Control Period (as defined below).

        Any severance payments under Mr. Pinchev's employment agreement will cease if Mr. Pinchev competes with Rackspace, is hired or

after which Rackspace will have 60 days to cure. If Rackspace has not cured and Mr. Pinchev elects to terminate his
employment, he must do so within 10 days after the end of the cure period.

Employment Agreement with Tiffany Lathe

        On September 11, 2007, Ms. Lathe and Rackspace entered into an employment agreement, which provides for a three month notice
requirement in order to terminate employment. If Ms. Lathe signs a participation agreement under the Severance Plan, she will forfeit her
other severance payments and benefits (including under her employment agreement) payable during the Change of Control Period (as
defined below).

U.S. Severance Guidelines

        Under Rackspace's U.S. severance guidelines, Rackspace generally offers severance benefits to each U.S. employee whose
employment agreement does not include any type of severance payment (such as Mr. Pichler) and whose employment is terminated
involuntarily for reasons other than cause, subject to his or her execution of a separation agreement that includes a general release of
claims.

        The amount of severance paid under the U.S. severance guidelines to a non-commissionable employee (such as Mr. Pichler) is equal
to a specified number of weeks of his or her base salary, which includes the annual amount of regular earnings paid to the employee based
on his or her work schedule and does not include shift differential, overtime, benefits, bonuses/commissions, or any other form of cash
compensation. Under the U.S. severance guidelines, Mr. Pichler could receive severance equal to 16 weeks of his base salary plus an
additional three weeks of his base salary for each full year of service (up to a maximum total severance amount equal to 52 weeks of his
base salary). If Mr. Pichler signs a participation agreement under the Severance Plan, he will not be entitled to severance benefits under the
U.S. severance guidelines during the Change of Control Period (as defined below).

        For purposes of the U.S. severance guidelines, "cause" means an employee's: (1) intentional act of fraud, embezzlement, theft or any
other material violation of law that occurs during or in the course of employment with Rackspace; (2) intentional breach of any of
Rackspace's policies; (3) insubordination; or (4) willful or continued failure to substantially perform his or her duties for Rackspace (other
than as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness).

Senior Executive Change of Control and Severance Plan

        In connection with entering into the merger agreement, Rackspace adopted the Severance Plan, pursuant to which certain of
Rackspace's executive officers and other designated key employees (which we refer to as "participants") are eligible to receive severance
benefits, in each case subject to the

participant signing a participation agreement and in lieu of any other severance payments and benefits. Generally, if a participant's
employment with Rackspace (or any parent or subsidiary of Rackspace) is terminated on or within 24 months following the consummation
of a Change of Control (as defined in the Severance Plan) (which we refer to as the "Change of Control Period") either by Rackspace (or
any parent or subsidiary of Rackspace) other than for Cause (as defined in the Severance Plan), death, or disability or by the executive
officer for Good Reason (as defined in the Severance Plan), then the Severance Plan provides for (1) severance payments equal to (a) the
sum of the participant's base salary plus his or her target bonus, each as in effect immediately prior to the executive officer's termination or
immediately prior to the Change of Control (whichever is greater), multiplied by (b) 250% for Mr. Rhodes, 200% for certain executive
officers other than Mr. Rhodes and Tiffany Lathe, or 100% for Ms. Lathe and certain other participants, payable ratably over a period of
30 months, 24 months or 12 months, respectively, in accordance with Rackspace's payroll practices; (2) a pro-rated portion (based on the
number of days of employment in the fiscal year of the participant's termination) of the actual annual performance bonus that the
participant would otherwise be entitled to receive based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance objectives for the
fiscal year of termination, payable in a lump sum at the same time as bonuses for such fiscal year are paid to similarly situated employees;
(3) a lump sum cash payment equal to the cost of continued health benefits for a period of 24 months for Mr. Rhodes, 18 months for
certain executive officers other than Mr. Rhodes and Ms. Lathe, or 12 months for Ms. Lathe and certain other participants; and
(4) outplacement assistance of up to $25,000 for each of the year of the participant's termination of employment and the following year. In
order to receive severance benefits under the Severance Plan, a participant must timely execute and not revoke a release of claims in favor
of Rackspace and comply with cooperation, non-solicitation, non-disparagement and non-competition obligations for a specified period
following his or her termination, which is 18 months for Mr. Rhodes, 15 months for executive officers other than Mr. Rhodes and
Ms. Lathe, or 12 months for Ms. Lathe and certain other participants. In addition, the Severance Plan provides that, if any payment or
benefits to a participant (including the payments and benefits under the Severance Plan) would constitute a "parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and would therefore be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal
Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits will be either (1) reduced to the largest portion of the payments and benefits that would
result in no portion of the payments and benefits being subject to the excise tax; or (2) not reduced, whichever, after taking into account all
applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the excise tax, results in the participant's receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater
payments and benefits.

        The consummation of the merger will constitute a "Change of Control" under the Severance Plan.

        Under the Severance Plan, the following definitions are used:

• "Cause" means any of the following reasons: 

• a participant's engagement in illegal conduct or gross misconduct or gross negligence which is materially injurious
to Rackspace; 

• a participant's conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, a felony or a crime of moral turpitude; 

• a participant's engagement in fraud, embezzlement or material misappropriation; 

• a participant's repeated use of alcohol or drugs that materially interferes with the performance of the executive
officer's duties; 

• a material breach by a participant of any written policies of, or agreement with, Rackspace (which policy, policies
or agreement previously were provided to the executive officer), which, if capable of remedy in the reasonable
judgment of Rackspace, the participant has

failed to remedy within 30 days of receiving written notice thereof from the Severance Plan's administrator to the
participant describing such material breach in reasonable detail and the participant having had the opportunity to address
the administrator regarding such alleged material breach; or

• a participant's willful and continual failure substantially to perform his or her duties with Rackspace (other than a
failure resulting from the participant's incapacity due to disability or death), which failure has continued for a
period of at least 30 days after written notice thereof from the Severance Plan's administrator to the participant
describing in reasonable detail the participant's failure to perform such duties or responsibilities and the participant
having had the opportunity to address the administrator regarding such alleged failures and the participant having
failed to remedy the same within 30 days of receiving written notice. 

• "Good Reason" means the participant's voluntary resignation as an employee of Rackspace within 30 days following the
expiration of any Cure Period (as defined below) after one of the following conditions has come into existence without his
or her consent: 

• a change in the participant's position within Rackspace (or a parent or subsidiary employing the participant) that
materially reduces the participant's level of duties, authority or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to the
Change of Control, but excluding any change or reduction due solely to Rackspace's ceasing to be an independent
publicly traded company and/or becoming a privately held subsidiary of another entity (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, not due to any action taken by Rackspace or any parent or subsidiary of Rackspace after the Change of
Control); 

• a reduction in the participant's level of annual base salary and/or annual target cash bonus by a combined amount
that is 10% or more of the sum of the participant's annual base salary immediately prior to such reduction and the
participant's annual target cash bonus immediately prior to such reduction (other than in connection with a similar
one-time decrease for substantially all other comparable employees of Rackspace); 

• Rackspace (or a parent or subsidiary employing the participant) requires the participant to relocate the principal
place of performance of the participant's duties to a location more than 50 miles from the participant's primary
residence at the time of consummation of the Change of Control, provided, however, that if the participant has been
commuting more than 50 miles to the principal place of performance of the participant's duties prior to the
consummation of the Change of Control, the relocation must increase the participant's commute by more than 50
miles; or 

• the material breach by Rackspace (or a parent or subsidiary employing the participant) of the agreement under
which the participant provides services to Rackspace (or a parent or subsidiary employing the participant).

        The participant's resignation will not constitute a resignation for Good Reason unless the participant first provides Rackspace (or a
parent or subsidiary employing the participant) with written notice of the acts or omissions constituting the grounds for Good Reason
within 90 days of the initial existence of the grounds for Good Reason and Rackspace (or a parent or subsidiary employing the participant)
has 30 days following the date of such notice to cure the condition constituting Good Reason (which we refer to as the "Cure Period").

Golden Parachute Compensation

        The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K published by the SEC regarding certain

more information on the terms of the payments quantified below, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards" and "The Merger—Interests of Rackspace's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Payments Upon Termination Following Change of Control."

        The figures in the table are estimated based on (1) compensation and benefit levels as of December 1, 2016; (2) an assumed effective
date of December 1, 2016, for the merger; (3) the assumption that each named executive officer is a participant in the Severance Plan,
thereby foregoing any severance under their employment agreements or other severance arrangements with Rackspace, as applicable,
during the Change of Control Period; (4) the assumed termination of the named executive officer's employment without cause on the day
immediately following such effective date for the merger; and (5) assuming that Rackspace does not provide vesting terms for any named
executive officer that are different from those described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Treatment of
Equity-Based Awards." The amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be
accurate on the relevant date. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the merger
may differ from the amounts set below.

        Rackspace's executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation, or tax reimbursement in connection
with the merger.

        As required by applicable SEC rules, all amounts below that are determined using the per share value of Rackspace's common stock
have been calculated based on the per share merger consideration.

immediately following the effective date for the merger will be: (1) $3,285,000 for Mr. Rhodes, which consists of $1,460,000 of base salary severance and $1,825,000 of
bonus severance; (2) $976,736 for Mr. Roenigk; (3) $424,038 for Mr. Pichler, which represents 49 weeks of his base salary; (4) $212,500 for Mr. Crenshaw; and
(5) $72,839 for Ms. Lathe, which represents the base salary she would be entitled to receive during the notice period under her employment agreement, as converted from
pound sterling to U.S. dollars based on an exchange rate of 1GBP to 1.315132 USD.

(2) These amounts include the "single-trigger" payments of the company stock-based award consideration for the portions of unvested time-vesting company stock-based
awards that are otherwise scheduled to vest by their terms on or before December 31, 2016 and for performance company stock-based awards that were granted after
August 22, 2013, but prior to December 1, 2015 (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Interests of Rackspace's Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards"). The following table quantifies the value of such payments, which is calculated for each such
equity award by multiplying (1) the number of shares subject to such equity award (which, for such performance company stock-based awards, will be the target number
of shares subject to such equity awards) by (2) the difference between the per share merger consideration and the exercise price per share, if any, attributable to such
equity award. None of the named executive officers hold any unvested company options with a per share exercise price less than the per share merger consideration.

(3) These amounts include the "double-trigger" payments of any then-unpaid portion of company stock-based award consideration in respect of unvested time-vesting
company stock-based awards that are otherwise scheduled to vest by their terms on or after January 1, 2017 or performance company stock-based awards granted on or
after December 1, 2015 that become immediately payable if a named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination of employment (as described in the section of
this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Interests of Rackspace's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards"). The
following table quantifies the value of such payments, which is calculated for each such equity award by multiplying (1) the number of shares subject to such equity
award (which, for such performance company stock-based awards, will be the target number of shares subject to such equity awards) by (2) the difference between the per
share merger consideration and the exercise price per share, if any, attributable to such equity award.

(4) These amounts represent the "double-trigger" benefit of outplacement assistance of up to $25,000 for each of the year of the named executive officer's termination of
employment and the following year assuming he or she signs a participation agreement under the Severance Plan (as described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned "The Merger—Interests of Rackspace's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Termination Following Change of Control"). If
Mr. Rhodes does not sign a participation agreement under the Severance Plan, the amount of the "double-trigger" benefit of reimbursement for the cost of COBRA
continuation coverage to which he may become entitled under his employment agreement (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—
Interests of Rackspace's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Termination Following Change of Control") upon the assumed termination of
his employment without cause on the day immediately following the effective date for the merger will be $31,608. If any other named executive officer does not sign a
participation agreement under the Severance Plan, he or she will not receive any perquisites/benefits under his or her employment agreement or the U.S. severance
guidelines upon the assumed termination of his or her employment without cause on the day immediately following the effective date for the merger. 

(5) As noted above, Mr. Rhodes's employment agreement and, if a named executive officer signs a participation agreement under the Severance Plan, the Severance Plan each
provide that in the event that any payment or benefit provided to the applicable named executive officer would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code (as a result of a payment or benefit being classified as a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code), then such named
executive officer will receive such payment as would entitle him or her to receive the greatest after-tax benefit, even if it means Rackspace paying him or her a lower
aggregate payment so as to minimize or eliminate the potential excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. Based on the assumptions used in
preparing this table, the only named executive officer that we expect to be subject to such a reduction (to avoid the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal
Revenue Code) is Mr. Roenigk. However, the actual value of the named executive officers' payments and benefits for purposes of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue
Code may vary depending on factors such as the actual closing date of the merger, in which case it is possible that the named executive officers other than Mr. Roenigk
may also have their payments or benefits so reduced in connection with the merger under the terms of Mr. Rhodes's employment agreement or the Severance Plan, as
applicable. 

(6) The amounts listed in the "Cash" and "Equity" columns for Ms. Lathe are as converted from pound sterling to U.S. dollars based on an exchange rate of 1GBP to
1.315132 USD.

Compensation of the Members of the Transactions Committee

        In connection with their service on the Transactions Committee, the Rackspace Board approved the payment of $50,000 to each of
the members of the Transactions Committee.

Employment Arrangements Following the Merger

        As of the date of this proxy statement, none of Rackspace's executive officers have (1) reached an understanding on potential
employment or other retention terms with the surviving corporation or with Apollo Management, Parent or Merger Sub; or (2) entered into
any definitive agreements or arrangements regarding employment or other retention with the surviving corporation or with Apollo
Management, Parent or Merger Sub following the consummation of the merger. However, prior to the effective time of the merger, Apollo
Management, Parent or Merger Sub may initiate discussions regarding employment or other retention terms and may enter into definitive
agreements regarding employment or retention for certain of Rackspace's employees, to be effective as of the effective time of the merger.

Financing of the Merger 

        Rackspace anticipates that the total funds needed to complete the merger (including the funds to pay Rackspace stockholders and to
pay the holders of other equity-based interests the amounts due to them under the merger agreement), which is expected to be
approximately $4.9 billion, will be funded through a combination of the following:

• Debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3.2 billion as well as a committed $225 million senior secured
revolving facility, a portion of which will be available at closing. Parent has received firm commitments from a consortium
of financial institutions to provide the debt financing, which includes the revolving credit facility (as described in the
section of this proxy statement captioned "Financing of the Merger—Debt Financing"). 

• Equity commitments by the Apollo Funds in an aggregate amount of up to $1.707 billion. Parent has received equity
commitments for the equity financing from the Apollo Funds (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
"Financing of the Merger—Equity Financing"). 

• Cash of Rackspace and its subsidiaries available to be utilized in respect of the payment of the merger consideration to
Rackspace stockholders and holders of company stock-based awards and company options, if any.

        The completion of the merger is not conditioned upon Parent's receipt of financing.

Debt Financing

        In connection with the entry into the merger agreement, Parent has entered into a commitment letter, as amended or modified from
time to time (which we refer to as the "debt commitment letter") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank AG New York
Branch, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Barclays Bank PLC, Royal Bank of Canada, Credit
Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and PSP Investments Credit USA LLC to provide Merger Sub, severally but not jointly,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the debt commitment letter, in the aggregate up to $3.2 billion in debt financing as
well as a $225 million senior secured revolving facility (only a portion of which is available to be drawn at the closing of the merger),
consisting of the following:

• up to a $2.0 billion senior secured term facility; 

• a $225 million senior secured revolving facility; and

Table of Contents

• up to a $1.2 billion senior unsecured bridge facility (less the amount of any senior unsecured notes issued as described
below).

        The debt commitment letter also contemplates that Merger Sub will, at its option, either (1) issue senior unsecured notes in a
Rule 144A or other private placement on or prior to the closing of the merger yielding up to $1.2 billion in aggregate gross cash proceeds;
or (2) if any or all of the senior unsecured notes are not issued on or prior to the closing date of the merger and the proceeds thereof made
available to Merger Sub on the closing date of the merger, borrow up to such unissued amount in the form of senior unsecured bridge loans
under the senior unsecured bridge facility.

        The proceeds of the debt financing will be used (1) to finance, in part, the payment of the amounts payable under the merger
agreement; (2) to repay certain existing indebtedness of Rackspace and to redeem and discharge certain senior unsecured notes of
Rackspace; and (3) for general corporate purposes.

        The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter are subject to a
number of conditions, including (1) the execution and delivery of definitive documentation consistent with the terms of the debt
commitment letter; (2) the substantially simultaneous completion of the merger in accordance with the merger agreement (without giving
effect to any amendment, waiver, consent or other modification to the merger agreement that is materially adverse to the lenders in their
capacities as such unless it is approved by the debt commitment parties); (3) the consummation of the equity financing, prior to, or
substantially simultaneously with, the initial borrowings under the debt facilities; (4) since August 26, 2016 no company material adverse
effect (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties");
(5) delivery of certain audited, unaudited and pro forma financial statements; (6) as a condition to the availability of the senior unsecured
bridge facility, Merger Sub having used commercially reasonable efforts to afford the investment banks a marketing period of 15
consecutive calendar days (subject to certain blackout dates) following receipt of a customary preliminary prospectus, preliminary offering
memorandum or preliminary private placement memorandum, which includes certain financial statements; (7) as a condition to the
availability of the senior secured term loan facility and the senior secured revolving facility, Merger Sub having used commercially
reasonable efforts to afford the arrangers a marketing period of 15 consecutive calendar days (subject to certain blackout dates) following
receipt of a customary confidential information memorandum; (8) payment of all applicable invoiced fees and expenses; (9) the repayment
of certain outstanding debt of Rackspace; (10) the receipt of documentation and other information about the borrower and guarantors
required under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations (including the PATRIOT Act); (11) the
execution and delivery of guarantees by certain guarantors and the taking of certain actions necessary to establish and perfect a security
interest in specified items of collateral; (12) the accuracy in all material respects of specified representations and warranties in the loan
documents under which the debt financing will be provided and of certain representations and warranties in the merger agreement; and
(13) delivery of certain customary closing documents.

        The obligations of the debt commitment parties to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter will terminate at the
earlier of (1) the termination date (as defined in and, if applicable, extended pursuant to and as set forth in the section of this proxy
captioned "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement") if the closing shall not have occurred on or prior to such
date; (2) the termination of the merger agreement without the consummation of the merger having occurred; and (3) the completion of the
merger without the use of the applicable debt financing.

        Parent and Merger Sub are required under the merger agreement to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be
taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the financing on the terms
and conditions contemplated by the debt commitment letter and any related fee letter. In the event any portion of the

Table of Contents

debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the debt commitment for any reason, Parent and Merger
Sub are required under the merger agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative third-party financing from alternative
sources in an amount that when added to the available portion of the debt financing and the equity financing is sufficient to fund the
aggregate per share merger consideration, fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Sub and the surviving corporation in connection with the
merger and the financing, repay, prepay or discharge the principal of and interest on, all other outstanding indebtedness of Rackspace
contemplated by the merger agreement and financing commitments and their other payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the
surviving corporation contemplated under the merger agreement (which we refer to as the "required amount"), and on terms and conditions
that are not less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than the terms in the debt commitment letter. In no event will reasonable best efforts of
Parent and Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require Parent or Merger Sub to pay any material fees in excess of that contemplated by
the debt commitment letter. As of the last practicable date before the printing of this proxy statement, the debt commitment letter remains
in effect, and Parent has not notified us of any plans to utilize financing in lieu of the financing described above. Except as described in
this proxy statement, there is no plan or arrangement regarding the refinancing or repayment of the debt financing. The documentation
governing the debt financing contemplated by the debt commitment letter has not been finalized and, accordingly, the actual terms of the
debt financing may differ from those described in this proxy statement.

        The debt commitment parties may invite other banks, financial institutions and institutional lenders to participate in the debt financing
contemplated by the debt commitment and to undertake a portion of the commitments to provide such debt financing.

Equity Financing

        Parent, or an affiliate of Parent, has received an equity commitment letter, dated as of August 26, 2016 (which we refer to as the
"equity commitment letter") from the Apollo Funds pursuant to which the Apollo Funds have committed, on a several but not joint basis,
subject to the conditions of the equity commitment letter, to provide equity financing (which we refer to as the "equity financing") in an
aggregate amount of up to approximately $1.707 billion, or such lesser amount, together with (1) the cash of Rackspace and its
subsidiaries utilized in respect of the payment of the merger consideration to Rackspace stockholders and holders of company stock-based
awards and company options, if any; and (2) the debt financing, as may be required by Parent to make the payment of the merger
consideration to Rackspace stockholders, option holders and stock unit holders at the closing of the merger as set forth in the merger
agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein.

Equity Commitment Letter

        Funding of the equity financing is subject to the conditions provided in the equity commitment letter, which include: (1) the
satisfaction in full or valid waiver, on or before the closing of the merger, of all of the conditions precedent to Parent and Merger Sub's
obligations to consummate the merger; (2) the satisfaction in full or valid waiver, on or before the closing of the merger, of all the
conditions precedent to the funding of the debt financing and the concurrent receipt by Parent and Merger Sub of the net cash proceeds of
the debt financing (on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the debt financing commitment); and (3) the concurrent
consummation of the closing of the merger agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement.

        The equity commitment letter and the obligations of the Apollo Funds to fund all or any portion of the equity financing will
automatically terminate and cease to be of any further force or effect without the need for any further action by any person (at which time
the obligations of the Apollo Funds under the equity commitment letter shall be immediately discharged) upon the earliest of (1) the valid
termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms; (2) consummation of the

closing of the merger; (3) the payment in full by the Apollo Funds of all amounts which may become due under their guaranteed
obligation pursuant to the limited guarantee; and (4) the assertion, directly or indirectly, by Rackspace or any of its affiliates, or any of its
or their respective representatives, of any claim (whether at law or equity or in tort, contract or otherwise) against any of the Apollo Funds
or, any of their former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, general or limited partner, officer, director,
employee, investment professional, manager, stockholder, member, agent, affiliate, assignee, financing source or representative of any of
the foregoing or any of their respective successors or assigns (which we refer to as a "related party") or any related party of a related party
in connection with the equity commitment letter, the merger agreement, the debt commitment letter, the limited guarantee or any other
transaction document or any of the transactions contemplated thereby (including the termination or abandonment thereof) (including in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection therewith), except, solely with respect to clause (4), for (a) its
rights against Parent and Merger Sub solely to the extent expressly provided under the merger agreement and solely pursuant to the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof; (b) its rights to enforce as a third party beneficiary the equity commitment letter solely to the extent
expressly provided under the equity commitment letter and solely pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions thereof and of the
merger agreement; (c) its rights to enforce the confidentiality letter agreement, dated April 25, 2016, between Rackspace and Apollo
Management (which we refer to as the "confidentiality agreement"), solely to the extent expressly provided under the confidentiality
agreement and solely pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions thereof; and (d) its rights against the guarantors solely to the
extent expressly provided under the limited guarantee solely pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions thereof (the claims in (a)-
(d) are referred to collectively as the "permitted claims"). Immediately upon termination of the equity commitment letter and without the
need for any further action by any person, no Apollo Fund or any related party of an Apollo Fund, or any related party of a related party
shall have any further obligation or liability under the equity commitment letter.

        Rackspace is an express third party beneficiary of the equity commitment letter for the purpose of causing the equity financing to be
funded, but solely to the extent that Rackspace has been awarded, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the merger agreement,
specific performance to require Parent to cause the equity financing under the equity commitment letter to be funded. Rackspace may not
enforce Parent's obligation to cause the equity financing to be funded or to complete the merger if the debt financing has not been funded
in full.

Limited Guarantee 

        Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Rackspace's willingness to enter into
the merger agreement, Parent and Merger Sub delivered to Rackspace the limited guarantee, pursuant to which, and subject to the terms
and conditions contained therein, the guarantors are guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the
merger agreement.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger 

        The closing of the merger will take place on (1) a date to be agreed upon by Parent, Merger Sub and Rackspace that is no later than
the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the Merger Agreement) of the last to be satisfied or
waived of the closing conditions of the merger (described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—
Conditions to the Closing of the Merger"), other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions; or (2) such other time agreed to in writing by Rackspace, Parent and
Merger Sub. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the marketing period (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The

Merger Agreement—Efforts to Close the Merger—Marketing Period Cooperation and Efforts") has not ended at the time of satisfaction or
waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions to closing of the merger, other than conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the closing of the merger, then closing will occur on the earlier of (1) any business day during such marketing period specified
by Parent to Rackspace on no less than on two business days' prior written notice to Rackspace; and (2) the third business day after the
final day of the marketing period, subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. On the closing date, the
parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will
become effective upon the filing and acceptance of such certificate of merger, or at a later time agreed to in writing by the parties and
specified in such certificate of merger.

Appraisal Rights 

        If the merger is consummated, Rackspace stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who
properly demand an appraisal of their shares, who continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger and who
otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL will, subject to the conditions thereof, be entitled to appraisal rights in
connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as "Section 262"). Unless the context requires otherwise,
all references in Section 262 and in this summary to a "stockholder" are to a record holder of common stock.

        The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its
entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated into this proxy statement by
reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Rackspace
stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand
appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder's name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of
record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an
appraisal of such holder's shares. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you
wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee to ensure that appraisal rights
are exercised.

        Under Section 262, holders of record of shares of common stock who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's
shares to Rackspace prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement; (3) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time of the merger; and (4) otherwise comply with
the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive
payment in cash of the "fair value" of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. However, after an
appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal rights will
dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Rackspace stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of
common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the common stock as
measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds
$1 million. We refer to these conditions as the "ownership thresholds." Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion,
determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of
the merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established
from time to time during such period. However, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation
pays to each

Table of Contents

Rackspace stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if
any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore
accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such
entry of judgment.

        Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less
than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the record date for notice of such meeting that
appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes Rackspace's notice to
stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex C. In connection with the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or
who wishes to preserve such holder's right to do so, should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of
Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A Rackspace stockholder who loses
his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration described in the merger agreement without interest.
Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, Rackspace
believes that if a Rackspace stockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

        Rackspace stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the
following:

• the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

• the stockholder must deliver to Rackspace a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger agreement at the
special meeting; 

• the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the
merger (a Rackspace stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time
of the merger); and 

• a stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person) or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of the
merger. The surviving corporation is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

        In addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled
to appraisal rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Rackspace stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless one of the
ownership thresholds is met.

        Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement, a Rackspace stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the
merger agreement, abstain or not vote his, her or its shares.

Filing Written Demand

        A Rackspace stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Rackspace, before the vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement at the special meeting at which the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, a
written demand for the appraisal of such stockholder's shares, and that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement. A Rackspace stockholder exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the

Table of Contents

shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective time of the
merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the Rackspace stockholder's right of appraisal and will nullify any previously
delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a Rackspace stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal
rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the
adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to
vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the
requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption
of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a demand. A Rackspace
stockholder's failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special
meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

        Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder's
name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must
reasonably inform Rackspace of the identity of the holder state that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such
stockholder's shares. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand
must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if such shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint
tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an
authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent
must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record
owner or owners.

        RACKSPACE STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER
NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER
OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER
OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL
INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER
NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY
MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

        All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Attention: Corporate Secretary

        Any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered
pursuant to the merger agreement by delivering to Rackspace a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such
attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require written approval of the
surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed
without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of
Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any Rackspace stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's

demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective time of the merger.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation

        If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each record
holder of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor
of the adoption of the merger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

        Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of shares of common
stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 (or the beneficial owner of such shares) may
commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation
in the case of a petition filed by a Rackspace stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all Rackspace
stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and
holders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the
shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all
necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in
Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify a previous written demand for
appraisal.

        Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with the
requirements for an appraisal of such holder's shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement
and with respect to which Rackspace has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The
surviving corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a
statement or within 10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner
of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition seeking
appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only
be made by a Rackspace stockholder of record.

        If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving
corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in
Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all Rackspace stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the
court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the Rackspace stockholders who have complied with
Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the Rackspace
stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of
the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may
dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

Table of Contents

        The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Rackspace stockholders who assert appraisal rights
unless (1) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of
common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262; or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of the
shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.

Determination of Fair Value

        After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, and that at least one of the
ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the Rackspace stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding
will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings.
Through such proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the "fair value" of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the
date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including
any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the
judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery's entry of judgment in
the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each Rackspace stockholder seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation makes a
voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (1) the difference, if
any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (2) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme
Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof
of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in
court" should be considered, and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company." The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value,
asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the
merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather
applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of
Delaware also stated that "elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of
the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered."

        Rackspace stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if
they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of
view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of
the DGCL. Although Rackspace believes that the per share merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the
outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and Rackspace stockholders should
recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the

per share merger consideration. Neither Rackspace nor Parent anticipates offering more than the per share merger consideration to any
Rackspace stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Rackspace and Parent reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment
pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the "fair value" of a
share of common stock is less than the per share merger consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the
ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the Rackspace stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an
appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys' fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may
be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under
the circumstances. Upon application of a Rackspace stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of
the expenses incurred by any Rackspace stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        If any Rackspace stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or
loses or validly withdraws, such holder's right to appraisal, the stockholder's shares of common stock will be deemed to have been
converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the per share merger consideration as provided in the merger
agreement, without interest. A Rackspace stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose, such holder's right to appraisal if no petition
for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied
in respect of the Rackspace stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written
withdrawal of such holder's demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share merger consideration as provided in the merger
agreement in accordance with Section 262.

        From and after the effective time of the merger, no Rackspace stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote
such shares of common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or
other distributions payable to Rackspace stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger): provided,
however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, or if such stockholder delivers to the surviving
corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days
after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of the surviving corporation, then the right of such stockholder
to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as
to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any Rackspace stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation.

        Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a Rackspace stockholder's
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before
attempting to exercise those rights.

Accounting Treatment 

        The merger will be accounted for as a "purchase transaction" for financial accounting purposes.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to U.S.
Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive
cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the
"Code"), Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which
we refer to as the "IRS") and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to
change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of common
stock as "capital assets" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).

        This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in
light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:

• tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax
laws, such as financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations, partnerships and any other entity or
arrangement treated as a partnership or pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and shareholders, partners
or investors in such entities; insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders in securities that
elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; regulated investment companies; real estate
investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; holders who hold their common stock as "qualified small
business stock" for purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code; or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the
United States; 

• tax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk
reduction transaction; 

• tax consequences to holders who received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction or pursuant to the
exercise of options or warrants; 

• tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar; 

• tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch
thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States; 

• tax consequences to holders who are "controlled foreign corporations," "passive foreign investment companies" or
"personal holding companies" for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

• tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income; 

• the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any; 

• any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences; or 

• tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares
under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend
upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of common stock and
partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.

Table of Contents

        No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger described
below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final
determination by a court.

        THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL
ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S.
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS
OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.

U.S. Holders

        For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax
purposes:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 

• an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

• a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more
United States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid election in effect under
applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

        The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder's gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
cash received and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis
generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-
term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder's holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the
merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including
individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of shares of common
stock at different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to
each block of our common stock.

Non-U.S. Holders

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "Non-U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is neither a
U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by
an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the
United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to
U.S.

Table of Contents

persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of
30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);

• such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that
disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or 

• Rackspace is or has been a "United States real property holding corporation" as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of
the Code (which we refer to as a "USRPHC") at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or
such Non-U.S. Holder's holding period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock (which we refer to as the
"relevant period") and, if shares of common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to
attribution rules more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which case such gain will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet point above),
except that the branch profits tax will not apply. We believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at any time
during the five-year period preceding the merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 28%) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to
the merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and
certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-
U.S. Holder that (1) provides a certification of such Non-U.S. Holder's non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a
substitute or successor form); or (2) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional
tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder's U.S. federal
income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger 

General

        Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective controlled affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and Rackspace (and its
affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to comply with all regulatory
notification requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement. These approvals include approval under, or notifications pursuant to, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (which we refer to as the "HSR Act") and
the competition laws of the European Union and Israel.

        In addition, each of Parent and Rackspace have agreed to: (1) cooperate and coordinate (and cause its respective representatives to
cooperate and coordinate) with the other in the making of such filings; (2) use its reasonable best efforts to supply the other (or cause the
other to be supplied with) any information that may be required in order to make such filings; (3) use its respective reasonable best efforts
to supply (or cause the other to be supplied) with any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the Federal
Trade Commission (which we refer to as the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the "DOJ"),
or the governmental authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing is made; and (4) use its reasonable best efforts
to take all action necessary to, as soon as practicable, cause the

expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other competition laws applicable to the
merger and obtain any required consents pursuant to any competition laws applicable to the merger. On September 29, 2016, the FTC
granted early termination of the waiting period of the HSR Act, effective immediately.

        If and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other competition laws applicable to
the merger, each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective controlled affiliates, if applicable) will (1) offer, negotiate, commit to and
effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (a) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the capital
stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Rackspace and its
subsidiaries; and (b) any other restrictions on the activities of Rackspace and its subsidiaries; and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the merger agreement, in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be obligated pursuant to the merger agreement to,
and Rackspace will not without the prior written consent of Parent, (1) sell, divest, license or hold separate any capital stock or other
equity or voting interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses; or (2) take, or commit to take any action
that, in each case, would be reasonably likely to (a) materially adversely impact the benefits expected to be derived by Parent as a result of
the merger; or (b) impose material limitations on the ownership by Parent or any of its subsidiaries of all or a material portion of
Rackspace's business or assets.

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters

        Under the HSR Act, the merger cannot be completed until Rackspace and Parent file a Notification and Report Form with the FTC
and the DOJ as required by the HSR Act, and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. The parties filed a notification
and report form with the FTC and DOJ on September 8, 2016. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the
expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period following the parties' filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms (which waiting
period, in relation to the merger, would expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on October 11, 2016) or the early termination of that waiting
period. On September 29, 2016, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period of the HSR Act, effective immediately.

        At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act,
the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including
seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or
hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger,
and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it
deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain
circumstances.

Foreign Competition Laws

        Rackspace and certain entities affiliated with Parent conduct business in Member States of the European Union. Council Regulation
(EC) No. 139/2004, as amended, and accompanying regulations require notification of and approval by the European Commission of
mergers or acquisitions involving parties with worldwide sales and European Union sales exceeding given thresholds before these mergers
and acquisitions can be implemented.

Table of Contents

        Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004, the European Commission has 25 business days from the day following the date
of receipt of a complete notification, which period may be extended to 35 business days under certain circumstances, in which to consider
whether the merger would significantly impede effective competition in the common market (as defined by European Community
regulations) or a substantial part of it, in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position. By the end of that
period, the European Commission must issue a decision either clearing the merger, which may be conditional upon satisfaction of the
parties' undertakings, or opening an in-depth "Phase II" investigation. A Phase II investigation may last a maximum of an additional 125
business days. Additionally, the European Commission has the power to suspend the merger control review period each time it deems it
requires additional information to complete its merger control assessment. It is possible that an investigation could result in a challenge to
the merger based on European Union competition law or regulations.

        The completion of the merger is also subject to certain filing requirements and approvals under the competition laws of Israel. The
Israeli Antitrust Authority has 30 calendar days from the receipt of a complete notification to consider whether the merger would
significantly impede effective competition pursuant to the Restrictive Trade Practices Law, 5748-1988. That period can be extended under
certain circumstances. The parties filed a notification with the Israeli Antitrust Authority on September 21, 2016.

        The parties have agreed to file merger notifications, as applicable, with the appropriate regulators in each of the required foreign
jurisdictions as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable and work cooperatively toward expedited regulatory clearances.

Other Regulatory Approvals

        One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the
necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or
overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is
currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will
ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial period of time between the approval by Rackspace stockholders and the completion
of the merger.

        Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these regulatory
clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not
involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger agreement.
These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        We are asking you to approve the adoption of the merger agreement. For a summary of and detailed information regarding this
proposal, see the information about the merger agreement throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth under the
sections of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger" and "The Merger Agreement." A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement. You are urged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.

PROPOSAL 2: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting. If Rackspace
stockholders approve this proposal, we can adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the
additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from Rackspace stockholders that have previously returned
properly signed proxies voting against adoption of the merger agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could
mean that, even if we received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the merger agreement such that the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the merger
agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the special meeting if a quorum is not present, and the chairperson of the special meeting
may also adjourn the special meeting for such purpose even if the Rackspace stockholders have not approved the proposal to adjourn the
special meeting.

The Rackspace Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" this proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL, ON A NON-BINDING, ADVISORY BASIS, OF CERTAIN MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS 

        Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010, requires that we provide Rackspace stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the
compensation that will or may become payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed
in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Interests of Rackspace's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Golden Parachute Compensation."

        We are asking Rackspace stockholders to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable by Rackspace to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this
proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Interests of Rackspace's Directors and Executive Officers of in the Merger—Golden Parachute
Compensation" and the accompanying footnotes. Except with respect to the Severance Plan, the various plans and arrangements pursuant
to which these compensation payments may be made generally have previously formed part of Rackspace's overall compensation program
for our named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to Rackspace stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion
and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the
Compensation Committee of the Rackspace Board, which is composed solely of non-employee directors, and are believed to be reasonable
and in line with marketplace norms.

        Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:

        "RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Rackspace approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may
become payable to Rackspace's named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the section captioned "The Merger—Interests of Rackspace's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden
Parachute Compensation" in Rackspace's proxy statement for the special meeting."

        Rackspace stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and as a non-binding, advisory
vote, the result will not be binding on Rackspace, the Rackspace Board or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are
contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote,
if the merger is consummated our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise
relates to the merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.

The Rackspace Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" this proposal.

PROPOSAL 4: ACCELERATION OF VESTING OF CERTAIN EQUITY AWARDS HELD BY RACKSPACE'S NON-
EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS 

        As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Equity Interests of Rackspace's Executive Officers and
Non-Employee Directors," Rackspace has a policy of granting an annual restricted stock unit award to its non-employee directors under
the 2007 LTIP in connection with Rackspace's Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We refer to these grants as "Annual Non-Employee
Director Grants." Each Annual Non-Employee Director Grant vests approximately one year from the grant date, subject to the non-
employee director remaining in service with Rackspace through the vesting date. The last Annual Non-Employee Director Grant occurred
in April 2016, in connection with Rackspace's 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

        Under the merger agreement, no Annual Non-Employee Director Grant will be assumed by Parent.

        The 2007 LTIP provides that each award issued thereunder will become fully vested and, if applicable, exercisable, if:

• the successor corporation in a "change in control" of Rackspace does not assume or substitute for the award (which we
refer to as the "Automatic Acceleration"); or 

• Rackspace terminates the employment of a 2007 LTIP participant without "cause" coincident with or during the 12-month
period immediately following a "change in control" of Rackspace, (which we refer to as the "Double Trigger
Acceleration").

        Under the terms of the merger agreement and as determined by Parent, at the closing of the merger, the service of each non-employee
Rackspace director will terminate. In addition, it is not anticipated that any non-employee Rackspace director will become an employee of
Rackspace. The completion of the merger will constitute a "change in control" under the 2007 LTIP.

        The 2007 LTIP permits the grant of awards to employees, directors and other service providers. However, Rackspace did not initially
make grants under the 2007 LTIP to its non-employee directors and did not focus on the fact that non-employee directors are not
technically in the "employment" of Rackspace. Rackspace reviewed the 2007 LTIP and related agreements in connection with the merger
and, in doing so, recognized that the provisions related to the Double Trigger Acceleration provide for vesting acceleration when the
"employment" of a 2007 LTIP participant terminates but arguably do not address how the vesting of an award is impacted when the service
of a non-employee director terminates under the same circumstances.

        Although Rackspace believes that the intent of the 2007 LTIP is and has always been to provide full vesting acceleration of Annual
Non-Employee Director Grants upon a termination of a non-employee director's service in connection with a "change of control"
(including the completion of the merger) by virtue of the Double Trigger Acceleration, the Rackspace Board recognizes that the non-
employee directors would be the beneficiaries of that interpretation. Accordingly, the Rackspace Board has elected to subject this result to
a confirmatory vote of Rackspace stockholders. Similarly, although Parent determined not to assume the awards held by non-employee
directors, thus triggering Automatic Acceleration, the Rackspace non-employee directors did not want to rely on that decision instead of
submitting the acceleration of vesting of the Annual Non-Employee Director Grants to a vote of the Rackspace stockholders.

        It is against this background that this proposal to formally approve the full vesting acceleration of the Annual Non-Employee Director
Grant is submitted for approval of the Rackspace stockholders. If Rackspace stockholders approve this proposal, then the vesting of each
Annual Non-Employee Director Grant will be accelerated in full and the award will be cashed out in connection with the closing of the

merger. If Rackspace stockholders do not approve this proposal, then each Annual Non-Employee Director Grant will be cancelled in
connection with the closing of the merger for no consideration.

        The following table shows the Annual Non-Employee Director Grants held by each non-employee director and the amounts that such
director would receive in respect of such grants if this proposal is approved and if it is not approved.

        The Rackspace Board believes that it is appropriate and in the best interests of Rackspace and its stockholders to accelerate the
vesting and cash-out in full of the Annual Non-Employee Director Grants because:

• These awards represent an important part of each director's compensation for serving on the Rackspace Board. 

• If these awards are cancelled for no consideration, the Rackspace non-employee directors will not receive the equity
compensation that Rackspace intended to provide them. 

• The vesting of non-employee director stock awards in connection with a sale of a publicly held company is a customary
and accepted practice. 

• If these awards are cancelled for no consideration, no benefit will be realized by the Rackspace stockholders.

        The approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger.

        The approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting. With respect to this proposal only, we will not consider any shares of common stock that are
beneficially owned by a director or executive officer of Rackspace to be entitled to vote on the proposal.

The Rackspace Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" this proposal.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger agreement in this
summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a
copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to
read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the merger
agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement
and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

        The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement (1) were made
only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger
agreement; (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Rackspace, Parent and
Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of
materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by
confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by Rackspace in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the
representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between
Rackspace, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to
such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal
purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate the merger if
the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise. Rackspace
stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Rackspace, Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations
and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a
representation or warranty may have been included in this proxy statement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the
closing of the merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the merger agreement after the effective time. In addition, you
should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Rackspace, Parent and
Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letters to the
merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public.
The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and
conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Rackspace, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read
alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Rackspace and
our business.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger 

        The closing of the merger will take place on (1) a date to be agreed upon by Parent, Merger Sub and Rackspace that is no later than
the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the Merger Agreement) of the last to be satisfied or
waived of the closing conditions of the merger (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—
Conditions to the Closing of the Merger"), other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions, or (2) such other time agreed to in writing by Rackspace, Parent and
Merger Sub. Notwithstanding the

foregoing, if the marketing period (as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Close
the Merger—Marketing Period Cooperation and Efforts") has not ended at the time of satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions to closing of the merger, other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger,
then closing will occur on the earlier of (1) any business day during such marketing period specified by Parent to Rackspace on no less
than two business days' prior written notice to Rackspace; and (2) the third business day after the final day of the marketing period, subject
to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. On the closing date, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing and acceptance
of that certificate of merger, or at a later time as may be agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.

Effects of the Merger; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers 

        The merger agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL,
at the effective time of the merger, (1) Merger Sub will be merged with and into Rackspace; (2) the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub will cease and (3) Rackspace will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. At the
effective time of the merger, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Rackspace and Merger Sub will vest in the
surviving corporation, and all of the debts, claims, liabilities, obligations and duties of Rackspace and Merger Sub will become the debts,
claims, liabilities, obligations and duties of the surviving corporation.

        At the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation of Rackspace as the surviving corporation will be amended and
restated in its entirety to read as set forth in an exhibit to the merger agreement, and the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger, will be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth in an exhibit to the merger
agreement will become the bylaws of the surviving corporation, until thereafter amended or restated.

        The parties will take all necessary actions so that at the effective time of the merger, the board of directors of the surviving
corporation will consist of the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified. The parties will take all necessary action so that at the effective time of the merger, the officers of Rackspace as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the officers of the surviving corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation until their successors are duly appointed.

Conversion of Shares 

Common Stock

        At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than shares (1) held by Rackspace as treasury
stock; (2) owned by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective direct or indirect subsidiaries; or (3) owned by each Rackspace stockholder
who has properly made a demand for appraisal under Delaware law and has neither effectively withdrawn, failed to perfect, waived or
otherwise lost such stockholder's right to appraisal with respect to such shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right
to receive cash in an amount equal to the per share merger consideration (which is $32.00 per share, without interest thereon and subject to
applicable withholding taxes) (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required)
in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement).

Table of Contents

        At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock that is (1) held by Rackspace; or (2) owned by Parent or
Merger Sub, or their respective direct or indirect subsidiaries, will be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

Equity Awards; ESPP

        The merger agreement provides that Rackspace's equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be subject to the following treatment at the effective time of the merger:

Stock Options

        At the effective time of the merger, each company option outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive the option consideration less any applicable
withholding taxes.

        If the per share exercise price of any company option, whether vested or unvested, is equal to or greater than the per share merger
consideration, such company option will be cancelled as of the effective time of the merger without any cash payment and will have no
further effect.

Stock-Based Awards

        At the effective time of the merger, each company stock-based award outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, to the extent vested (which generally includes unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards that are otherwise scheduled to
vest by their terms on or before December 31, 2016, as discussed in the following paragraph) and, if applicable, unexercised, will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the company stock-based award consideration less any applicable withholding taxes.

        At the effective time of the merger, each unvested time-vesting company stock-based award will be cancelled and converted into a
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the company stock-based award consideration in respect of such unvested
time-vesting company stock-based award, generally payable in semi-annual installments following the effective time of the merger
depending on the original vesting schedule of the corresponding company stock-based award and the title (as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger) of the holder of such award, as follows:

Vice President and Below 

        Unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards that are scheduled to vest by their terms on or before December 31, 2016,
generally will fully vest as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and will be subject to the vested stock-based award
treatment rather than the unvested stock-based award treatment.

        With respect to each performance company stock-based award that was granted (1) after August 22, 2013, the applicable performance
metrics will be deemed to have been satisfied as to 100% of the target number of shares of common stock subject to such performance
company stock-based award as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, regardless of when the performance period ends,
with each such performance company stock-based award granted (a) prior to December 1, 2015, subject to the vested stock-based award
treatment; and (b) on or after December 1, 2015, subject to the unvested stock-based award treatment; and (2) on August 22, 2013, such
performance company stock-based award will be treated in accordance with its terms.

        The receipt of the company stock-based award consideration in respect of such unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards
and unvested performance company stock-based awards, in each case, that are subject to the unvested stock-based award treatment is
generally subject to the recipient's continued employment following the effective time of the merger, except that any then-unpaid portion
of a recipient's company stock-based award consideration generally will become immediately payable if such recipient's termination of
employment (whenever occurring) is either (1) without Cause (as defined in the 2007 LTIP); or (2) for Good Reason (as defined in either
(a) the Severance Plan, if the recipient is a participant in the Severance Plan as of immediately prior to such employee's termination date;
or (b) an effective employment agreement between such employee and Rackspace, the surviving corporation or their affiliates in all other
cases) (for the avoidance of doubt, clause (2) shall not apply to any employee who as of immediately prior to such employee's termination
of employment is neither a participant in the Severance Plan nor is party to an effective employment agreement that contains a definition
of "Good Reason"). However, before the effective time of the merger, Rackspace may provide different vesting terms for any employee
that are no more favorable to such employee than the terms described above. Any payments of stock-based award consideration in respect
of unvested time-vesting company stock-based awards and unvested performance company stock-based awards will be subject to any
applicable withholding taxes.

        Parent will not assume, substitute or convert any company stock-based award that is outstanding and, if applicable, unexercised, as of
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and that is held by a non-employee member of the Rackspace Board. Each company
stock-based award that is outstanding, and, if applicable, unexercised, as of immediately prior to the effective time and that is held by a
non-employee member of the Rackspace Board will, subject to the approval of the Rackspace stockholders (excluding, for this purpose,
any shares of common stock beneficially held by such non-employee members of the Rackspace Board) be fully vested as of immediately
prior to the effective time and will be subject to the vested stock-based award treatment.

ESPP

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Rackspace Board has adopted resolutions, and has amended the terms of the ESPP
as necessary, (1) providing, or in order to provide, that each individual participating in the final offering will not be permitted to
(a) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect when that purchase period commenced; or

Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures 

        Prior to the closing of the merger, Parent will select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Rackspace (which we refer to
as the "payment agent") to make payments of the merger consideration to Rackspace stockholders. At or prior to the closing of the merger,
Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the payment agent cash that, when taken together with the amount to be deposited by
Rackspace as described below, is sufficient in the aggregate to pay the aggregate per share merger consideration to Rackspace stockholders
in accordance with the merger agreement. At the closing of the merger, after all of the conditions to closing of the merger have been
satisfied (other than those which by their terms are to be satisfied at closing) or waived and after Parent has confirmed in writing that it
will consummate the closing of the merger, then Rackspace will, in consultation with and in accordance with the directions having been
given by Parent, deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the payment agent an amount of cash of Rackspace and its subsidiaries designated
by Parent, if any, which amount will not exceed the cash balances of Rackspace and its subsidiaries that are not being used for other
purposes and that are available to be utilized in respect of the payment of the merger consideration under the merger agreement.

        Promptly (and in any event within three business days) following the effective time of the merger, the payment agent will mail to
each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger represented outstanding shares of common stock (subject to certain exceptions) whose shares of common stock were
converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof under the merger agreement, a letter of transmittal and
instructions advising Rackspace stockholders how to surrender stock certificates in exchange for the per share merger consideration. Upon
receipt of (1) surrendered certificates for cancellation (or an appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, together with
any required bond); and (2) a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required in
accordance with such material and instructions, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (a) the number of shares represented by such certificate and (b) the per share merger consideration in

exchange therefor, without interest. The amount of any per share merger consideration paid to Rackspace stockholders may be reduced by
any applicable withholding taxes.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of common stock held in book-entry form (which we refer to as "uncertificated
shares") will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal (as both are described above) to the payment agent
to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger) of uncertificated shares that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented an outstanding share of
common stock (subject to certain exceptions) will, upon receipt of an "agent's message" in customary form at the effective time of the
merger, be entitled to receive, and the payment agent will pay and deliver as promptly as practicable, an amount in cash equal to the
product of (1) the number of uncertificated shares held by such stockholder and (2) the per share merger consideration. The amount of
consideration paid to such Rackspace stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.

        If any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the merger, such cash will
be returned to Parent upon demand, and any Rackspace stockholders as of immediately prior to the merger who have not complied with
the exchange procedures in the merger agreement will thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for payment (subject to
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar law). None of Parent, Merger Sub, Rackspace, the surviving corporation or the payment
agent will be liable to any Rackspace stockholder with respect to any cash amounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar law.

        The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a Rackspace stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has been
stolen or destroyed. In the event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then the payment agent will issue the per
share merger consideration to such holder upon the making by such holder of an affidavit for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate.
Parent or the payment agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the per share merger consideration,
require such stockholder to deliver a bond in such amount as Parent or the payment agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent, the surviving corporation or the payment agent with respect to such certificate.

Representations and Warranties 

        The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of Rackspace, Parent and Merger Sub.

        Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement made by Rackspace are qualified as to "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect." For purposes of the merger agreement, "Company Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to
Rackspace, any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, effect or circumstance (which we refer to as an "Effect") that, individually or that
taken together with all other Effects that exist or have occurred prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the Company
Material Adverse Effect, (1) has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities,
financial or other condition or results of operations of Rackspace and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (2) would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the merger, except that, solely with respect to clause (1)
above, none of the following (by itself or when aggregated) to the extent occurring after the date of the merger agreement will be deemed
to be or constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or will be taken into account when determining whether a Company Material
Adverse Effect has occurred or may, would or could occur:

• changes in general economic conditions in the United States or any other country or region in the world, or changes in
conditions in the global economy generally (except to the extent that

operating in the industries in which Rackspace and its subsidiaries conduct business), in which case only the incremental
disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into account in determining whether there has occurred a Company Material
Adverse Effect); 

• any geopolitical conditions, outbreak of hostilities, acts of war, sabotage, terrorism or military actions (including any
escalation or general worsening of any such hostilities, acts of war, sabotage, terrorism or military actions) in the United
States or any other country or region in the world (except to the extent that such Effect has had a disproportionate adverse
effect on Rackspace relative to other companies operating in the industries in which Rackspace and its subsidiaries conduct
business), in which case only the incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into account in determining
whether there has occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect);

impact thereof on the relationships, contractual or otherwise, of Rackspace and its subsidiaries with employees, suppliers,
customers, partners, vendors or any other third person) (other than for purposes of certain representations and warranties,
and certain related terms and conditions, concerning conflicts due to the performance of the merger agreement);

of the merger agreement), Rackspace has agreed to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations with, and terminate any data room or other diligence access of, any person, its affiliates and its representatives relating to an

• furnish or otherwise provide access to any non-public information regarding, or to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or personnel of, Rackspace or its subsidiaries to any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective designees) in any case in connection with any acquisition proposal, or with the intent to induce the making,
submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist an acquisition proposal or the making of
any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

• fail to enforce or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of securities
of Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries unless the Rackspace Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant
to applicable law, except, that Rackspace will be permitted to waive any provision of any standstill or confidentiality
agreement only to the extent that such provision prohibits a confidential proposal being made to the Rackspace Board; or 

• authorize or commit to do any of the above.

        Notwithstanding these restrictions, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Rackspace stockholders and after entering into
an acceptable confidentiality agreement, Rackspace and the Rackspace Board (or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through
one or more of their representatives, following the execution of an acceptable confidentiality agreement: (1) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with; (2) furnish any non-public information in relation to Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries to; or (3) afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Rackspace or any of its

consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead

counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; and (4) Rackspace substantially

such person or its representatives that was not previously made available to Parent.

        If Rackspace, its subsidiaries or its or their representatives receives an acquisition proposal (as defined below), an inquiry from any
person related to making a potential acquisition proposal or any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with Rackspace or its representatives at any time prior to the earlier to occur of the
termination of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger, Rackspace must promptly (and in all events by the later of
24 hours from the receipt thereof, and 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the next business day) advise Parent of such acquisition proposal or
request, including the identity of the person making such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and the material terms and conditions thereof

keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such offers or proposals (including any amendments
thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

        For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement:

• an "acquisition proposal" is any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent or Merger Sub) relating to an
acquisition transaction; 

• an "acquisition transaction" is any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the merger) involving any: 

• direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act) of
persons, whether from Rackspace or any other person, of securities representing more than 15% of the total
outstanding voting power of Rackspace after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other
acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any person or "group" of persons that, if
consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such person or "group" of persons beneficially owning
more than 15% of the total outstanding voting power of Rackspace after giving effect to the consummation of such
tender offer or exchange offer; 

• direct or indirect purchase (including by way of a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction), exclusive license or other acquisition by any person or
"group" of persons of assets (including equity securities of any subsidiary of Rackspace) constituting or accounting
for more than 15% of the revenue, net income or consolidated assets of Rackspace and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; or 

• merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other
transaction involving Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries whose business accounts for more than 15% of the
revenue, net income or consolidated assets of Rackspace and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, where the
stockholders of Rackspace (or such subsidiary) prior to the transaction will not own, directly or indirectly, at least
85% of the surviving company; 

• a "alternative acquisition agreement" is any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other contract relating to an acquisition transaction; and 

• a "superior proposal" is a bona fide written acquisition proposal (substituting 50% for 15% in the definition of "acquisition
proposal" above) for an acquisition transaction on terms that the Rackspace Board (or a committee thereof) has determined
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) would be more favorable, from a
financial point of view, to the Rackspace stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the merger (taking into account
(1) any revisions to the merger agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination or
any reaffirmation thereof; and (2) those other factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Rackspace Board (or
any committee thereof), including the identity of the person making the proposal, the likelihood of consummation in
accordance with the terms of such proposal, and the legal, financial (including financing terms), regulatory, timing and
other aspects of such proposal).

The Rackspace Board's Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change 

        The Rackspace Board has recommended that the holders of shares of common stock vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement. The merger agreement provides that the Rackspace Board will not effect a company board recommendation change except as
described below.

        Except as set forth below, at no time after the date of the merger agreement may the Rackspace Board or a committee thereof (with
any action described in the following (other than the final list item) being referred to as a "company board recommendation change"):

• withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the
Rackspace Board's recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub; 

• adopt, approve, or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, an acquisition proposal; 

• fail to publicly reaffirm the Rackspace Board's recommendation within 10 business days of the occurrence of a material
event or development and after Parent so requests in writing (or if the special meeting is scheduled to be held within 10
business days, then within one business day after Parent so requests in writing); 

• take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange
offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Rackspace Board
(or a committee thereof) to Rackspace's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Rackspace Board (or a committee thereof) may
refrain from taking a position with respect to an acquisition proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the 10th business day
after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such acquisition proposal without such action
being considered a violation of the merger agreement); 

• fail to include the Rackspace Board's recommendation in this proxy statement; or 

• cause, permit or authorize Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.

        Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Rackspace stockholders, the
Rackspace Board may, upon compliance with the procedures described below, effect a company board recommendation change (1) in
response to an intervening event (as defined below) other than in connection with a written acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior
proposal; or (2) if Rackspace has received a bona fide written acquisition proposal that the Rackspace Board (or a committee thereof) has
concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal, in each case, if the
Rackspace Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
that a failure to effect a company board recommendation change would be inconsistent with the Rackspace Board's fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable law.

        The Rackspace Board may effect a company board recommendation change, but may not terminate the merger agreement, in
response to an intervening event if and only if:

• Rackspace has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five business days in advance to the effect that the Rackspace
Board (or a committee thereof) has (1) made the determination described above; and (2) resolved to effect a company
board recommendation change pursuant to the merger agreement, which notice must describe the applicable intervening
event in reasonable detail; and 

• prior to effecting such company board recommendation change, Rackspace and its representatives, during such five
business day period, must have (1) negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that the
Rackspace Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial

advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a company board recommendation change in response to such
intervening event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; and (2) permitted Parent and
its representatives to make a presentation to the Rackspace Board regarding the merger agreement and any adjustments
with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation).

        In addition, the Rackspace Board may effect a company board recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement to enter
into an alternative acquisition agreement in response to a bona fide written acquisition proposal that the Rackspace Board (or a committee
thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal if and
only if:

• the Rackspace Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; 

• Rackspace has complied with its obligations pursuant to the merger agreement with respect to such acquisition proposal; 

• Rackspace has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five business days in advance to the effect that the Rackspace
Board (or a committee thereof) has (1) received a bona fide written acquisition proposal that has not been withdrawn;
(2) concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such acquisition
proposal constitutes a superior proposal; and (3) resolved to effect a company board recommendation change or to
terminate the merger agreement, which notice will describe the basis for such company board recommendation change or
termination, including the identity of the person or "group" of persons making such acquisition proposal, the material terms
of such acquisition proposal and copies of all relevant documents (including the most current version of the proposed
agreement under which such acquisition proposal is proposed to be consummated) relating to such acquisition proposal;
and 

• prior to effecting such company board recommendation change or termination, Rackspace and its representatives, during
the five business day notice period described above, have (1) negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to
the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement so that such acquisition proposal would cease to constitute a superior proposal; and (2) permitted Parent and its
representatives to make a presentation to the Rackspace Board regarding the merger agreement and any adjustments with
respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation).

        In the event of any material revision, amendment, update or supplement to any such bona fide written acquisition proposal described
above, Rackspace has also agreed to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the above procedures with respect to such
new written notice (with the notice period being three business days from the date of such notice) and no company board recommendation
change or termination will be permitted by Rackspace unless, at the end of such three day notice period, the Rackspace Board (or a
committee thereof) has in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination
that such bona fide written acquisition proposal is a superior proposal.

        For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, an "intervening event" means any change, event, violation,
inaccuracy, effect or circumstance that (1) as of the date of the merger agreement was not known to the Rackspace Board, or the material
consequences of which (based on facts known to the members of the Rackspace Board as of the date of the merger agreement) were not
reasonably foreseeable as of the date of the merger agreement; and (2) does not relate to any acquisition proposal.

Stockholder Meeting 

        Rackspace has agreed to take all necessary action to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the special
meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of this proxy statement, except that the special meeting is not
required to be held at any time prior to the 20th business day following the mailing of this proxy statement. Rackspace is permitted to
postpone or adjourn the special meeting in certain circumstances related to soliciting additional proxies or requirements of applicable law.

Employee Benefits 

        From and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to)
honor all Rackspace benefit plans and all of Rackspace's compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms.
However, nothing will prohibit the surviving corporation from amending or terminating any such Rackspace benefit plans or compensation
or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable law.

        For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will
cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) either (1) maintain for the benefit of each continuing employee the company plans
at benefit levels that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect at Rackspace or its subsidiaries on the date of the merger
agreement, and provide compensation and benefits to each continuing employee pursuant to such company plans; (2) provide comparable
plans; or (3) provide some combination of company plans and comparable plans such that each continuing employee receives
compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and, subject to the previous
paragraph, individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation,
benefits and severance payments (other than opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements)
provided to such continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. In each case, base compensation and target
incentive compensation opportunity will not be decreased for a period of one year following the effective time of the merger for any
continuing employee employed during that period. For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger, the surviving
corporation will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to) provide severance benefits to eligible full-time regular employees no
less favorable than Rackspace's past practices and severance calculation set forth in the Rackspace disclosure letter, without regard to the
right to exercise discretion to reduce such levels, taking into account service both before and after the closing of the merger.

        To the extent that a company plan or comparable plan is made available to a continuing employee at or after the effective time of the
merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation or one of its subsidiaries to)
cause to be granted to such continuing employee credit for all service with Rackspace and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the
merger for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for
purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement, but excluding for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plans or retiree health plans), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of
coverage or benefits. In addition, (1) each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in
any and all new plans to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such new plan replaces coverage pursuant to an old plan; (2) for purposes
of each new plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to any continuing employee, the surviving
corporation will undertake commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such new plans to be waived for such continuing employee and
his or her covered

dependents, and the surviving corporation will undertake commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
continuing employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the old plan ending on the date that such
continuing employee's participation in the corresponding new plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such new plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new plan; and (3) credit the
accounts of such continuing employees pursuant to any new plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of
such continuing employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a continuing employee as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be credited to such continuing employee following the effective time of the merger and will be subject to
the vacation policies of the surviving corporation as in effect from time to time; provided, that vacation accrued but unused as of the
closing of the merger will remain available to the same extent as under Rackspace programs in effect as of the date of the merger
agreement as applied to each continuing employee.

Efforts to Close the Merger 

General

        Under the merger agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and Rackspace agreed to use reasonable best efforts to: (1) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions; (2) do, or cause to be done, all things; and (3) assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, or causing to be done,
all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to applicable law (including antitrust laws) or otherwise to
consummate, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the merger and effect the other contemplated transactions thereunder, including
using their reasonable best efforts to: (a) cause the conditions to the closing of the merger described below to be satisfied; (b) seek to
obtain all consents, waivers, approvals, orders and authorizations from, and make all registrations, declarations and filings with
governmental authorities; and (c) seek to obtain all consents, waivers and approvals, and deliver all notifications pursuant to any material
contracts in connection with the merger agreement.

        Additionally, under the merger agreement, if and to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the merger, Parent and
Merger Sub (and their respective controlled affiliates) have agreed to (1) offer and effect the divestiture or other disposition of any capital
stock or assets of Rackspace; and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal proceeding challenging the merger agreement or the
consummation of the merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Parent or merger Sub be obligated pursuant to the merger
agreement to, and Rackspace will not without the prior written consent of Parent, (1) sell, divest, license or hold separate any capital stock
or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses; or (2) take, or commit to take, any
action that, in each case, would be reasonably likely to (a) materially adversely impact the benefits expected to be derived by Parent as a
result of the merger; or (b) impose material limitations on the ownership by Parent or any of its subsidiaries of all or a material portion of
Rackspace's business or assets.

Debt Financing Cooperation

        Rackspace has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts, and will cause its subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts,
prior to the closing of the merger to provide, at the sole cost and expense of Parent, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or
Merger Sub to assist them in causing the conditions to the debt financing to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with Parent and Merger Sub obtaining the debt financing (so long as such cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with our ongoing operations or the ongoing operations of our subsidiaries or create an unreasonable risk of damage or destruction
to any of our (or our subsidiaries') property or assets).

Table of Contents

        The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are not conditioned upon the obtaining of the debt financing or
any replacement financing. None of Rackspace or its subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors, or employees will be required to
execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the debt financing that is not contingent upon the closing or that would be
effective prior to the closing and no directors of Rackspace that will not be continuing directors, acting in such capacity, will be required to
execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the debt financing. Parent will promptly reimburse us, upon our request, for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the equity financing and the debt financing and will indemnify
and hold harmless Rackspace, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims,
costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by
them in connection with their cooperation in arranging the debt financing or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith,
(which obligations we refer to as the "Reimbursement Obligations").

Marketing Period Cooperation and Efforts

        Under the merger agreement, Rackspace has agreed to allow Parent a period of 20 consecutive business days (subject to customary
blackout dates) to market the debt financing. This marketing period is a period throughout and at the end of which (1) Parent has received
certain required financial information and the required information is compliant; (2) the conditions to the obligations of Rackspace, Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at closing);
and (3) nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause the conditions to the obligations of Rackspace, Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the merger to fail to be satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the closing),
assuming that such conditions were applicable at any time during such 20 consecutive business day period. In the event that the debt
financing is not consummated during or upon the expiration of the 20 consecutive business day period, then, at Parent's option, the
marketing period will not end until the expiration of one additional 10 consecutive business day period commencing immediately after the
expiration of the initial 20 business day period, as set forth in a written notice to be delivered by Parent prior to the expiration of the initial
20 business day period and prior to the termination date (which notice will provide that certain closing conditions will be deemed satisfied
or waived). The marketing period will not be deemed to have commenced if prior to its expiration (1) Rackspace's independent public
accountant shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any financial statements contained in Rackspace's most recently filed
annual report on Form 10-K, in which case the marketing period shall not be deemed to commence until, at the earliest, a new unqualified
audit opinion is issued by the independent public accountant or another independent public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to
Parent; (2) Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries publicly announces an intention to restate any historical financial statements or that any
such restatement is under active consideration, in which case the marketing period will not commence unless and until, at the earliest, such
restatement has been completed and the relevant required information has been amended or Rackspace announces no such restatement is
required in accordance with GAAP; (3) any required financial information would not be compliant at any time during such 20 consecutive
business day period or otherwise does not include the required information; or (4) Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries have failed to file
any report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K required to be filed with the SEC by the date required under the Exchange Act, in
which case (a) in the case of a failure to file a Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, the marketing period will not be deemed to commence unless and
until, at the earliest, such reports have been filed; and (b) in the case of a failure to file a Form 8-K, the marketing period will be tolled
until such report has been filed, except that if the failure to file such report occurs during the final five business days of the marketing
period, the marketing period will be extended so that the final day of the marketing period will be no earlier than the fifth business day
after such report has been filed. If the marketing period is not completed on or before December 16,

2016, then it will not commence until January 3, 2017, except that notwithstanding anything in the section "The Merger Agreement—
Efforts to Close the Merger—Marketing Period Cooperation and Efforts" to the contrary, the marketing period in any event shall end on
any earlier date on which the debt financing is consummated.

Discharge of Existing Indebtedness Cooperation

        Rackspace will use its reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best efforts, to
arrange for the payoff, discharge and termination in full on the closing date of all amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility
and senior unsecured notes indenture. This proxy statement does not constitute an offer to purchase or notice of redemption with respect to
any of Rackspace's senior unsecured notes.

Indemnification and Insurance 

        The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the surviving
corporation and its subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill the obligations of Rackspace and its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification
agreements between Rackspace and any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or
officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger,
to the extent such indemnification agreements are substantially consistent in all material respects with the form of indemnification
agreement provided to Parent prior to the date of the merger agreement), on the other hand (which we refer to as the "indemnified
persons").

        In addition, the merger agreement provides that, during the six year period commencing at the effective time of the merger, the
surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each indemnified person, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, from and against all reasonable and documented costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys' fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement or compromise in connection with any legal proceeding to the extent arising, directly or indirectly, out of or pertaining, directly
or indirectly, to (1) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such indemnified person's capacity as a director or officer of
Rackspace or any of its subsidiaries (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or
after the effective time of the merger); and (2) the merger, as well as any actions taken by Rackspace, Parent or Merger Sub with respect
thereto (including any disposition of assets of the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the
surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries insolvent). Subject to certain terms and conditions, the merger agreement also provides
that, in the event of any such legal proceeding, the surviving corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses
of any counsel) as incurred by any such indemnified person in the defense of such legal proceeding.

        In addition, without limiting the foregoing but subject to the immediately forthcoming sentence, the merger agreement requires Parent
to cause the surviving corporation to maintain in effect Rackspace's directors' and officers' insurance policies in respect of acts or omission
occurring at or prior to the effective time, on terms that are equivalent to those currently in effect for a period of at least six years
commencing at the effective time of the merger. The surviving corporation is not required to pay premiums for such policy to the extent
such premiums exceed 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by Rackspace, and if the premium for such insurance coverage would
exceed such amount the surviving corporation will be obligated to obtain the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. In lieu of the foregoing, prior to the effective time of the merger, Rackspace may purchase (or, if Parent requests, Rackspace will
purchase) a pre-paid "tail" policy so long as the annual cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed 300% of the aggregate annual premiums
currently paid)

        The merger agreement also provides that the indemnified parties are third party beneficiaries of the indemnification and insurance
provisions in the merger agreement and are entitled to enforce such provisions.

        For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Interests of Rackspace's Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger."

Transaction Litigation 

        Rackspace will (1) provide Parent with prompt notice of all stockholder litigation relating to the merger agreement (including by
providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto); (2) keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof; (3) give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any such litigation; and (4) will consult with Parent with
respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any such litigation and will consider in good faith Parent's advice with respect to such
litigation. Rackspace may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement, or agree to do any of the foregoing, regarding any such
litigation without Parent's prior written consent (which consent may be given, conditioned or withheld in Parent's sole discretion).

Conditions to the Closing of the Merger 

        The obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and Rackspace to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where
permitted by applicable law) of certain conditions, including the following:

• the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under, or obtaining all requisite consents pursuant to, the
HSR Act and applicable antitrust laws of the European Union and Israel; and

preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction; (2) by any

        In addition, the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where
permitted by applicable law) of each of the following additional conditions, any of which may be waived exclusively by Parent:

• the representations and warranties of Rackspace relating to organization, good standing, corporate power, authority and
enforceability, approval of the Rackspace Board, anti-takeover laws, requisite stockholder approval, no broker fees and the
absence of any Company Material Adverse Effect being true and correct as of the date on which the closing occurs as if
made at and as of such date (except to the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier
date, in which case such representation and warranty shall have been true and correct as of such earlier date); 

• the representations and warranties of Rackspace relating to Rackspace subsidiaries, certain aspects of the capitalization of
Rackspace, no conflicts, Goldman Sachs' fairness opinion, and anti-corruption and international trade being true and
correct in all material respects both when made and as of the date on which the closing occurs as if made at and as of such
date (except to the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case
such representation and warranty will be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date);

correct both when made and as of the date on which the closing occurs as if made at and as of such date (except to the
extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation
and warranty will be true and correct as of such earlier date), except for such inaccuracies that are de minimis in nature; 

• the other representations and warranties of Rackspace set forth elsewhere in the merger agreement being true and correct
(without giving effect to any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications set forth therein) as of the date
on which the closing occurs as if made at and as of such date (except to the extent that any such representation and
warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty will be true and correct as
of such earlier date), except for such failures to be true and correct that would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

• Rackspace having performed and complied in all material respects with all covenants and obligations of the merger
agreement required to be performed and complied with by it at or prior to the effective time of the merger;

(without giving effect to any materiality or Parent material adverse effect qualifications set forth therein) both when made
and as of the date on which the closing occurs as if made at and as of such date (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty will be
true and correct as of such earlier date), except for such failure to be true and correct (considered collectively) that would
not have a Parent material adverse effect; 

• Parent and Merger Sub having performed and complied in all material respects with all covenants and obligations of the
merger agreement required to be performed and complied with by Parent and Merger Sub at or prior to the effective time of
the merger; and

the failure to satisfy the conditions to the closing of the merger or the failure to consummate the merger by
the termination date; and 

• in the event that the marketing period has commenced but has not completed as of the time of the
termination date, the termination date may be extended (or further extended) by Parent in its sole discretion
by providing written notice thereof to Rackspace at least one business day prior to the termination date until
four business days after the then-scheduled expiration date of the marketing period; or

of the Rackspace stockholders at the special meeting);

        In the event that the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination rights above, the merger agreement will be of no
further force or effect without liability of any party to the other parties (or their representatives), as applicable, except certain sections of
the merger agreement will survive the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with their respective terms, including terms
relating to termination fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the merger agreement will relieve Rackspace from any liability for
any willful breach of the merger agreement, nor will any party be relieved from liability for its fraud. In addition, no termination of the
merger agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any party pursuant to the confidentiality agreement between Rackspace and
Apollo Management, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with
their respective terms.

Termination Fees 

        Rackspace has agreed to pay Parent a termination fee of $112 million if the merger agreement is terminated in specified
circumstances.

        Parent will be entitled to receive the termination fee from Rackspace if:

• (1) the merger agreement is validly terminated by (a) either Parent or Rackspace because Rackspace stockholders do not
adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting; or (b) Parent because Rackspace has breached or failed to perform in
any material respect any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger
agreement (and has not cured such breach or failure to perform during a cure period), such that the related closing
condition would not be satisfied; (2) following the date of the merger agreement and prior to its termination under certain
circumstances, an acquisition proposal has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed or, in the case only of a
termination by Parent due to Rackspace's material breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
in the merger agreement, otherwise communicated to Rackspace; and (3) Rackspace enters into an agreement providing for
the consummation of, or consummates, an acquisition transaction within one year of such termination of the merger
agreement (except that, for purposes of the termination fee, all references to "15%" in the definition of "acquisition
transaction" are deemed to be references to "50%"); 

• the merger agreement is validly terminated by Parent because the Rackspace Board has effected a company board
recommendation change; or 

• the merger agreement is validly terminated by Rackspace, to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to
a superior proposal.

        If the merger agreement is validly terminated by Parent because Rackspace has materially breached its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement, then Rackspace must concurrently with such termination pay or cause to be paid
to Parent or its designee an amount equal to that required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates for all fees and
expenses (up to a maximum of $5,500,000) (which we refer to as the "parent expenses") incurred in connection with the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated therein.

        Parent has agreed to pay Rackspace a termination fee of $253 million if the transaction is terminated in other specified circumstances.
Rackspace will be entitled to receive the termination fee from Parent if:

• the merger agreement is validly terminated by Rackspace because Parent or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform
in any material respect any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger
agreement (and has not cured such breach or failure to perform during a cure period), such that the related closing
condition would not be satisfied (and such material breach or material failure to perform by Rackspace is or would be the
primary cause of the failure of the related closing condition); or 

• the merger agreement is validly terminated by Rackspace because (1) the marketing period has ended and (a) all of the
conditions applicable to Parent, Merger Sub and Rackspace's obligations to close the merger and (b) Parent and Merger
Sub's obligations to close the merger have, in each case, been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, each of which is capable of being satisfied at
the closing); (2) Parent and Merger Sub fail to close the merger on the date required pursuant to the merger agreement;
(3) Rackspace has delivered an irrevocable written notice to Parent that (a) it is ready, willing and able to close the merger;
and (b) the conditions applicable to Rackspace's obligations to close the merger have been satisfied or waived; and
(4) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the merger by the third business day after the delivery of the notice
described in clause (3).

        Neither Parent nor Rackspace is required to pay to the other its termination fee on more than one occasion.

        Rackspace's receipt of the termination fee payable by Parent to Rackspace to the extent owed (including, without duplication,
Rackspace's right to enforce the limited guarantee with respect thereto), the Reimbursement Obligations and the Company's right to
specific performance are the sole and exclusive remedies of Rackspace. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, under no circumstances
can Rackspace receive (1) both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief to cause the equity financing to be funded
(whether under the merger agreement or the equity commitment letter) and the occurrence of the closing, on the one hand, and (a) payment
of any monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance) whatsoever or (b) payment of any of the
termination fee payable by Parent to Rackspace (including through the enforcement of the limited guarantee) or the Reimbursement
Obligations, on the other hand; or (2) both payment of any monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance) whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of any of the termination fee payable by Parent to Rackspace and the amounts
(including through the enforcement of the limited guarantee) or the Reimbursement Obligations, on the other hand.

Specific Performance 

        Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Rackspace, Merger Sub and Parent are entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of the merger agreement and to enforce the
terms of the merger agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Effective Time of the Merger"); (4) Rackspace has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the equity financing
and debt financing are funded, it would cause the closing of the merger to occur; and (5) Parent fails to complete the closing within two
business days after delivery of such confirmation.

        Rackspace will be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent to comply with obligations to enforce its rights under the debt
commitment letters to cause the debt financing sources to fund the debt financing if (1) all of the conditions applicable to Parent, Merger
Sub and Rackspace's obligations to close the merger and all of the conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub's obligations to close
the merger (described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "The Merger—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger") have been
satisfied or waived; (2) Parent fails to consummate the merger on the closing date (described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned "The Merger—Closing and Effective Time of the Merger"); and (3) all of the conditions to the consummation of the debt
financing under the debt commitment letters have been satisfied (other than the receipt of the equity financing).

Fees and Expenses 

        Except in specified circumstances, whether or not the merger is completed, Rackspace, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other hand, are each responsible for all of their respective costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Expenses incurred in connection with the printing, filing and mailing of this proxy
statement will be shared equally by Parent and Rackspace.

No Third Party Beneficiaries 

        The merger agreement is binding upon and inures solely to the benefit of each party thereto, and nothing in the merger agreement,
expressly or impliedly, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any rights or remedies, except (1) at and after the effective time
(a) benefits to the directors and officers who are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of certain terms of the merger agreement; and
(b) the rights of the holders of shares of common stock, company stock-based awards or company options to receive merger consideration;
or (2) with respect to certain terms of the merger agreement, the financing sources and their related parties and related parties of Parent and
Merger Sub, as applicable.

Amendment and Waiver 

        Subject to applicable law, the merger agreement may be amended in writing by the parties at any time, whether before or after
adoption of the merger agreement by Rackspace stockholders. However, after adoption of the merger agreement by Rackspace
stockholders, no amendment that requires further approval by such stockholders pursuant to the DGCL may be made without such
approval.

        At any time prior to the effective time, any party may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other parties, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties in the merger agreement or waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions

THE VOTING AGREEMENT 

        The following summary describes the material provisions of the voting agreement. The descriptions of the voting agreement in this
summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the voting agreement, a
copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to
read the voting agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the voting
agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the voting agreement
and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

        In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, Parent entered into a voting agreement with Mr. Weston, and certain
affiliate entities. Mr. Weston holds, in the aggregate, approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of common stock.

Voting Provisions 

        Under the voting agreement, Mr. Weston agreed, during the term of the voting agreement, to vote his shares of common stock (1) for
the approval of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger; (2) in favor of any
proposal to adjourn or postpone a meeting of the stockholders to a later date if there are not a sufficient number of votes to adopt the
merger agreement; and (3) against (a) any action or proposal in favor of an acquisition proposal (without regard to the terms of such
acquisition proposal); (b) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would (i) reasonably be expected to result in a material
breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Rackspace under the merger agreement; or
(ii) prevent or materially delay, or would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger; or (c) except as expressly contemplated by the merger agreement, any
change in any manner to the voting rights of any Rackspace stockholders.

Restrictions on Transfer 

        Pursuant to the voting agreement, absent the prior written consent of Parent, Mr. Weston agreed that, until the earlier of (1) the end of
the term of this Agreement; and (2) the date on which approval of the Rackspace stockholders is obtained, he will not, (a) transfer, pledge,
hypothecate, encumber, assign, tender in any tender or exchange offer or other disposition (which we refer to as a "Transfer"), or enter into

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 

        The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of August 31, 2016, as to
(1) each person who is known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of any class of our outstanding common stock; (2) each of the
named executive officers; (3) each director; and (4) all directors and executive officers as a group. Unless otherwise indicated, the address
of each listed stockholder is c/o Rackspace Hosting, Inc., 1 Fanatical Place, San Antonio, TX 78218.

        Applicable percentage ownership is based on 126,361,535 shares of common stock outstanding at August 31, 2016. In computing the
number of shares of stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares
subject to options held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of August 31, 2016, and shares issuable
upon the vesting of restricted stock units within 60 days of August 31, 2016. However, we did not deem these shares to be outstanding for
the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

after December 1, 2015, such Performance Company Stock-Based Award shall be treated in the manner set forth in
Section 2.8(a)(ii) of this Agreement, and each other Performance Company Stock-Based Award shall be treated in the
manner set forth in Section 2.8(a)(i) of this Agreement. For each Performance Company Stock-Based Award granted on
August 22, 2013, such Performance Company Stock-Based Award shall be treated in accordance with its terms.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the holder of such Performance Company Stock-Based Award
terminates his service to the Company before the Effective Time, the outstanding and unvested portion of a Performance
Company Stock-Based Award as of immediately prior to the termination date will be forfeited.

        (iv)    Withholding; 409A.    The payment of the Company Stock-Based Award Consideration will be subject to
withholding for all required Taxes. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 2.8(a), with respect to any Company
Stock-Based Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent
that payment of the Company Stock-Based Award Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.8(a) would otherwise
cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall instead be made at the
earliest time permitted under the Company Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not result in the imposition
of such Tax or penalty.

        (b)    Company Options.    At the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company
Option) by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (the
"Option Consideration"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Company Options, whether vested or unvested, for
which the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Options is equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such
Company Options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The payment of the Option
Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes.

        (c)    Payment Procedures for Vested Equity.    As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later than the
second payroll date after the Effective Time), the applicable holders of vested and, if applicable, exercisable, Company Stock-
Based Awards and Company Options will receive a payment (without interest) from the Company or the Surviving Corporation
(which amounts Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited, to the extent that Company cash as of the Closing is insufficient to
fund the payment of such amounts, with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, at or prior to the Closing),
through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of such vested
Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options that are cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) or
Section 2.8(b), as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such payment owed to a holder of vested Company Stock-
Based Awards or Company Options pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable, cannot be made through the
Company's or the Surviving Corporation's payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for
such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the Closing Date
(but in no event more than five Business Days thereafter).

        (d)    Further Actions.    The Company will take all action necessary to effect the cancellation of Company Stock-Based
Awards and Company Options as of the Effective Time and to give effect to this Section 2.8 (including the satisfaction of the
requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated

under the Exchange Act). All Company Stock-Based Awards and all Company Stock Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time,
and the provisions in any other Company Benefit Plan or Contract providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in
respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be cancelled as of the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time, no participant in any Company Stock Plan or Company Benefit Plan will have any right thereunder to acquire any
equity securities (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries.

        (e)    Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan.    As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
and in any event prior to the Effective Time and not later than the day immediately prior to the date on which the first offering
period that is regularly scheduled to commence under the ESPP after the date of this Agreement, the Company will take all
necessary actions, including obtaining any necessary determinations or resolutions of the Company Board (or a committee
thereof), if appropriate, and amending the terms of the ESPP as may be necessary or required under the ESPP and applicable Laws,
to (i) to provide that each individual participating in the Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) in progress on the date of this
Agreement (the "Final Offering") will not be permitted to (A) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP
from the rate in effect when that Purchase Period commenced; or (B) make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or
following the date of this Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law; (ii) ensure that, except for the Final Offering,
no offering period under the ESPP will be authorized or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement; (iii) if the Closing will
occur prior to the end of the Final Offering, provide each individual participating in the Final Offering with notice of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date; (iv) cause the Final Offering to end no later than one
Business Day prior to the Closing Date; (v) make any pro rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened Final
Offering Purchase Period, but otherwise treat such shortened Final Offering Purchase Period as a fully effective and completed
Purchase Period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; (vi) cause each ESPP participant's accumulated contributions under the
ESPP to be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering;
(vii) provide that the applicable purchase price for Company Common Stock will not be decreased below the levels set forth in the
ESPP as of the date of this Agreement; and (viii) ensure that no further rights are granted under the ESPP after the Effective Time.
Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger), the Company will
terminate the ESPP.

        2.9    Exchange of Certificates.     

        (a)    Payment Agent.    Prior to the Closing, (i) Parent will select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent"); and (ii) Parent or Merger Sub will enter into a
payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.

        (b)    Exchange Fund.    (i) At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.7(a) an amount of cash that, when taken together with the amount to be deposited by the Company pursuant to clause (ii)
below, is sufficient in the aggregate for the Payment Agent to make the payments of the aggregate consideration to which such
holders of Company Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(a); and (ii) at the Closing, after all of the conditions
to the Merger set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at
Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at Closing) or waived (if permissible under applicable Law) and Parent has
confirmed in writing that it will consummate the Closing, then the

Company will, in consultation with and in accordance with the directions having been given by Parent, deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7(a), an amount of cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries designated by Parent
(such designation to be made no less than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date), which amount shall not exceed the
Available Cash Amount. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested
by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (A) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United
States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no
more than 30 days; (B) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard &
Poor's Corporation, respectively; (C) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly
available); or (D) money market funds investing solely in a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three months (such cash and any proceeds thereon, the "Exchange Fund"). To the extent that (1) there
are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (2) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the
level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7(a); or (3) all or any portion of
the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by Section 2.7(a) for any reason, then Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for
distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7(a). Any
interest or other income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent
directs.

        (c)    Exchange and Payment Procedures.    

        (i)    Certificates.    Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days), Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the "Certificates") whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7(a), (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7(a). Upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided
in Section 2.11) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment Agent in accordance with the terms of such materials and
instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by
such Certificate (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as
practicable) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes
payable in respect thereof). The Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal

exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the Certificates on the amount
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the Certificates will
be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a).

        (ii)    Uncertificated Shares.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (the "Uncertificated Shares") will not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.7(a). In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of an
Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common
Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of Company Common Stock
were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a) will, upon
receipt of an "agent's message" in customary form (it being understood that the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be
deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an "agent's message" or such other evidence, if any,
as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent will cause the
Payment Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder's transferred
Uncertificated Shares by (B) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof). The
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any
holder of the Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this
Section 2.9(c)(ii). Until so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence
only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a). Any Per Share Price paid
upon surrender of an Uncertificated Share will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Uncertificated Share.

        (d)    DTC Payment.    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the
Payment Agent and DTC with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing
Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior
to the Effective Time by (B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the "DTC Payment"); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after
11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on
the first Business Day after the Closing Date.

        (e)    Transfers of Ownership.    If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the
Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company,
then the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7(a) may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate
is properly endorsed and

otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such
transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated
Shares will only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.

        (f)    No Liability.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then any such cash in
respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

        (g)    Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent.    Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of
Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable
in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to
which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(a).

        (h)    Cash Balances.    The Company shall deliver to Parent, upon request and no later than five Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, a written notice setting forth, in each case as of the close of business on the immediately preceding
Business Day, the aggregate cash balances held by the Company and its Subsidiaries (by Subsidiary and by jurisdiction) as well as
the amounts of such cash balances that are not being used for other purposes and that are available to be utilized in respect of the
obligations set forth in Section 2.8(c) and Section 2.9(b) (the "Available Cash Amount").

        2.10    No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.     From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company
Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the consideration payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7(a) (or in the case of Dissenting Company
Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c)). The consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any
shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance
with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

        2.11    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.     In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment
Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7(a). Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment
of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

        2.12    Required Withholding.     Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary
of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts
are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

        2.13    Necessary Further Actions.     If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and Merger Sub as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action.

        (h)    Tax Reserves.    Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the charges, accruals and reserves for
Taxes with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries reflected on the consolidated financial statements of the Company included
in the Company SEC Documents are adequate, in accordance with GAAP, to cover Taxes payable by the Company and its
Subsidiaries through the date of such consolidated financial statements.

        3.9    Benefits Matters; ERISA Compliance.     

        (a)    Company Benefit Plans.    Section 3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a
true, correct and complete list identifying each material Company Benefit Plan. The Company has made available true, correct and
complete copies of (i) all material Company Benefit Plans or, in the case of any unwritten material Company Benefit Plan, a
description thereof and, in each case, to the extent applicable, all amendments thereto; (ii) other than with respect to Company
Benefit Plans primarily for the benefit of non-U.S. employees, the most recent annual report on Form 5500 (other than Schedule
SSA thereto) filed with the IRS with respect to each Company Benefit Plan (if any such report was required); (iii) the most recent
summary plan description for each material Company Benefit Plan for which such summary plan description is required; (iv) each
trust agreement and group annuity contract relating to any material Company Benefit Plan; (v) the most recent financial statements
and actuarial reports for each material Company Benefit Plan (if any); and (vi) all material written communications to any
Governmental Authority relating to such material Company Benefit Plan made within the last year. For the purposes of this
Section 3.9(a), an agreement or arrangement with a consultant who is a natural person will not be considered material unless the
Company and its Subsidiaries paid such consultant more than $150,000 on an annual basis.

        (b)    Qualified Status.    All Company Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified and exempt from federal income Taxes
under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a), respectively, of the Code have been the subject of or have timely applied for, as of the
date of this Agreement, determination letters from the IRS to the effect that such Company Benefit Plans and the trusts created
thereunder are so qualified and tax-exempt, and no such determination letter has been revoked nor (i) to the Knowledge of the
Company, has revocation been threatened; (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, do any circumstances exist that could reasonably
be expected to adversely affect such qualification or exemption; and (iii) has any such Company Benefit Plan been amended since
the date of its most recent determination letter or application therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its qualification or
materially increase its costs.

        (c)    Pension Plans.    Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, during the six-year period ending on the date of
this Agreement, maintained, contributed to or been required to contribute to any Company Pension Plan. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any unsatisfied liability under Title IV of ERISA and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition
exists that is reasonably likely to cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur a liability under Title IV of ERISA. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, or within the six-year period ending on the date of this Agreement has had,
contributed to, been required to contribute to, or has or within the six-year period ending on the date of this Agreement has had any
obligation or liability (including "withdrawal liability" within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA) with respect to, any Company
Multiemployer Plan. No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 4063 or Section 4064
of ERISA). There does not now exist nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, do any circumstances exist that are reasonably likely
to result in any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Closing.

        (d)    No Terminations, Proceedings or Liabilities.    Except for matters that would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, no (i) Company Benefit Plans or trusts have been terminated,

nor is there any intention or expectation to terminate any Company Benefit Plans and trusts; (ii) Company Benefit Plans or trusts
are the subject of any proceeding by any Person, including any Governmental Authority, that could be reasonably expected to
result in a termination of any Company Benefit Plan or trust; and (iii) event has occurred and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
no condition exists that could be reasonably expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Tax, fine, Lien,
penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Laws.

        (e)    Ability to Amend.    With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan, such Company
Benefit Plan (including any Company Benefit Plan covering retirees or other former employees) may be amended subject to
applicable Law to reduce benefits or limit the liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries or terminated, in each case, without
material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries on or at any time after the Effective Time.

        (f)    Absence of Certain Plan Terms.    No Company Benefit Plan provides health, medical or other welfare benefits after
retirement or other termination of employment (other than for continuation coverage required under Section 4980(B)(f) of the
Code or applicable Law) in a manner that would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability to the Company and its
Subsidiaries on or at any time after the Effective Time.

        (g)    Compliance with Law.    Except for matters that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Company
Benefit Plan and its related trust, insurance contract or other funding vehicle has been established, registered, amended, funded,
invested, maintained and administered in accordance with its terms and is in compliance with ERISA (if applicable), the Code and
all other Laws applicable to such Company Benefit Plan; and (ii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with
ERISA, the Code and all other Laws applicable to the Company Benefit Plans.

        (h)    Absence of Claims.    Except for matters that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect and other than for
routine claims for benefits, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims, audits or inquiries by, on
behalf of or against any participant in any of the Company Benefit Plans, or otherwise involving any such Company Benefit Plan
or the assets of any Company Benefit Plan.

        (i)    Absence of Effects of the Merger.    None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger (alone or in conjunction with any other event, including any termination
of employment on or following the Effective Time) will (i) entitle any current or former director, officer, employee or Independent
Contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any compensation or benefit; (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting,
or trigger or increase any payment or funding, of any compensation or benefits, or trigger any other obligation, under any
Company Benefit Plan; or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, default under or limit the Company's right to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan.

        (j)    Section 280G/4999.    Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger will
(either alone or in combination with another event) result in the payment of any amount that would, individually or in combination
with any other such payment, (i) not be deductible as a result of Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding provisions of
foreign, state or local Law relating to Tax); or (ii) be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. The Company has
provided to Parent (A) its preliminary calculations with respect to the impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code (or any
corresponding provisions of foreign, state or local Law related to Tax) to the extent available as of the date hereof and (B) for each
Person intended to be a participant in the Rackspace Change in Control Severance Plan described

not required to be made or paid on or before the date of this Agreement, have been fully reflected on the consolidated financial

        (p)    Additional Company Benefit Plans.    Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any formal plan or has made

Company Benefit Plan or any other Company Benefit Plan that would be a material Company Benefit Plan as a result of such
improvements or changes.

        (q)    Prohibited Transactions.    Neither the Company, any Company Benefit Plan nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any
trustee, administrator or other third-party fiduciary and/or party-in-interest thereof has engaged in any breach of fiduciary
responsibility or any "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) to

        4.1    Organization, Standing and Power.     Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, except where the failure to be in good standing would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite power and authority and possesses all the Parent Permits, except
where the failure to have such power or authority or to possess Parent Permits would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the Company, prior to execution of this Agreement, true,
correct and complete copies of the charter and bylaws of Parent and Merger Sub.

        4.2    Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.     Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite power and authority to

in the case of the Merger, to the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub. Except for the adoption of
this Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement or to consummate the Merger (except for the filing of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL). Each of Parent and Merger Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms and conditions, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and, as to enforceability, by general principles of equity.

        4.3    No Conflicts; Consents.     

        (a)    No Conflicts.    The execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement does not, and the
performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger will not,

properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), any matters that would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Sub that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There is no judgment, order, writ, injunction, award or decree outstanding against

        4.9    Guarantee.     Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Guarantors have delivered to the Company the duly
executed Guarantee. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors,
enforceable against the applicable Guarantor in accordance with its terms and conditions, except as enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and, as to enforceability, by general principles
of equity. No event has occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would, or would reasonably be expected to,
constitute a default on the part of any Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.

        4.10    Financing.     

        (a)    Financing Letters.    As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete
copies of (i) an executed commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, between Parent and the Guarantors (the
"Equity Commitment Letter") pursuant to which the Guarantors have committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to
invest in Parent, directly or indirectly, the cash amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding a portion of the aggregate value
of the consideration payable in the Merger (the "Equity Financing"); and (ii) executed commitment letters, dated as of the date of
this Agreement, among Parent, Merger Sub and the lenders party thereto (the "Debt Commitment Letters" and, together with the
Equity Commitment Letter, the "Financing Letters") pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding a portion of the aggregate value of the
consideration payable in the Merger (the "Debt Financing" and, together with the Equity Financing, the "Financing"). Parent has
also delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of any fee letter (which may be delivered with the fee amounts,
"flex" terms and other economic terms redacted in a customary manner so long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely
affect the amount (below the Required Amount), conditionality, availability or termination of the Debt Financing) in connection
with the Debt Commitment Letters (any such letter, a "Fee Letter"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides that the Company is
an express third party beneficiary thereof in connection with the Company's exercise of its rights under Section 9.8(b).

        (b)    No Amendments.    As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Financing Letters have not been amended or modified prior
to the date of this Agreement; (ii) no such amendment or modification is contemplated by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
by the other parties thereto (other than to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar entities who
had not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement); and (iii) to the Knowledge of Parent, the
respective commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded, amended, supplemented or
modified in any respect. There are no other Contracts, agreements, side letters or arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a
party relating to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Letters, any Fee Letters, any customary credit letters or any customary engagement letters.

        (c)    Sufficiency of Financing.    Assuming (w) the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Letters, (x) the
accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III hereof and (y) the performance by the
Company and its Subsidiaries of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Financing, together with the
Available Cash Amount, is sufficient to satisfy Parent's obligations hereunder to (i) make all payments contemplated to be made by
Parent under this Agreement in connection with the Merger (including the payment of all amounts payable by Parent pursuant to
Article II in connection with or as a result of the Merger); (ii) repay, prepay or discharge (after giving effect to the Merger) the
principal of and interest on, and all other indebtedness outstanding pursuant to, the Credit Agreement and the Notes Indenture; and

Closing by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and the Financing (such amount, the "Required Amount").

        (d)    Validity.    As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Letters (in the forms delivered by Parent to the Company) are
in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto (including, with respect to the Equity Commitment Letter, Guarantor), as applicable, enforceable
against Parent, Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, as applicable, in accordance with their terms
and conditions, except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and, as to enforceability, by general
principles of equity. Other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters and any Fee Letter, there are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies related to the funding of the full proceeds of the Financing (including any "flex" provisions) pursuant to any
agreement relating to the Financing to which Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a party. As of
the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any counterparty to the Financing Letters has
committed any breach of any of its covenants or other obligations set forth in, or is in default under, any of the Financing Letters.
As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) constitute or result in a breach or default on the part
of any Person under any of the Financing Letters; (ii) constitute or result in a failure to satisfy any of the terms or conditions set
forth in any of the Financing Letters; or (iii) otherwise result in any portion of the Financing not being available. As of the date of
this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the
Merger, Parent has no reason to believe (both before and after giving effect to any "flex" provisions in the Debt Commitment
Letters) that (A) it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing to be satisfied by it, whether or
not such term or condition is contained in the Financing Letters; or (B) the full amounts committed pursuant to the Financing
Letters will not be available as of the Closing if the terms or conditions contained in the Financing Letters to be satisfied by it are
satisfied. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, all commitment or
other fees that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letters. Other
than as set forth in the Financing Letters, there are no conditions precedent related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the
full amount of the Financing.

        (e)    Exclusive Arrangements.    As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Guarantors, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates has entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (i) awarding any agent, broker, investment
banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis in connection with the Merger; or (ii) prohibiting or
seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt financing from providing or seeking to provide
debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger.

        4.11    Absence of Stockholder and Management Arrangements.     As of the date of this Agreement, other than the Voting Agreement,
none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a party to any Contract with any stockholder, director, officer, employee
or other Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a) relating to (i) this Agreement or the Merger; or (ii) the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations (including as to continuing employment) from and after the Effective
Time; or (b) pursuant to which any (i) holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount
or nature than the Per

equity investment to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to finance any portion of the Merger.

owns any interest in any Person that derives a substantial portion of its revenues from products, services or lines of business within the
Company's principal products, services or lines of business.

        4.13    Solvency.     Assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the
Merger, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III, and after giving effect to the Merger and
the payment of the amounts payable pursuant to Article II in connection with or as a result of the Merger and any other repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Letters, as of the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation will be
Solvent.

        4.14    Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties.     

        (a)    No Other Representations and Warranties.    Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries,
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III and the certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(c):

          (i)  neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (or any other Person) makes, or has made, any representation or

warranty must not be relied upon by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives as having

any other Person); and

        (iii)  the representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement are in lieu of and are exclusive of all
other representations and warranties, including any express or implied or as to merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose, and the Company hereby disclaims any other or implied representations or warranties, notwithstanding the
delivery or disclosure to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives of any documentation
or other information (including any financial information, supplemental data or financial projections or other forward-
looking statements).

        (b)    No Reliance.    Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, acknowledges and agrees that,

inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law, it being understood that, in such instance, the Company will not
be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to the extent
that such provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Company Board (or any committee

case, any Person or its Representatives that has made or delivered to the Company a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after
the date of this Agreement that was not solicited in breach of Section 5.3(a), but only if the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (A) such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; and (B) the
failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.3(b) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable
Law. In connection with the foregoing, the Company will substantially contemporaneously make available to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives that was
not previously made available to Parent.

modify, the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub; (B) adopt, approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the

then within one Business Day after Parent so requests in writing); (D) take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail
to make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation against such

Acquisition Proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the 10th Business Day after the commencement of a tender or
exchange offer in connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this
Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in
clauses (A) through (E), a "Company Board Recommendation Change"), it being understood that neither (1) the
determination in itself by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal; nor (2) the delivery in itself by the Company to Parent of any notice
contemplated by Section 5.3(d) will constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or violate this Section 5.3; or

         (ii)  cause, permit or authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

          (i)  other than in connection with a written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event

outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law if
and only if:

        (1)   the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five Business Days in advance to the
effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a

during such five Business Day period, have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the
extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; and
(B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this

thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior
Proposal, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such
Superior Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if:

        (1)   the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable Law;

        (2)   the Company has complied with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3 with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal; and

        (3)   (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five Business Days in advance (the
"Notice Period") to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) received a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and
(C) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 5.3(d)(ii), which notice will describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change or
termination, including the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of
such Acquisition Proposal and copies of all relevant documents (including the most current version of the proposed
agreement under which such Acquisition Proposal is proposed to be consummated) relating to such Acquisition
Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company

terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal; and (2) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding
this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a
presentation), it being understood that (a) in the event of any material revision, amendment, update or supplement
to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply
with the requirements of this Section 5.3(d)(ii)(3) with respect to such new written notice (with the "Notice Period"
in respect of such new written notice being three Business Days from the date of such notice); and (b) no Company
Board Recommendation Change or termination will be permitted by the Company unless, at the end of the Notice
Period, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination that such bona fide written Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal.

continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives. Such notice must include (A) the identity of the Person or Group
making such proposal, inquiry, request or offer (unless such disclosure is prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality
agreement with such Person or Group that is in effect on the date of this Agreement); and (B) a summary of the material terms and
conditions of such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and, if writing, a copy thereof. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such offers or proposals (including any updates or
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

        (f)    Certain Disclosures.    So long as the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in such disclosure (other than in a customary "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act):

          (i)  nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from

circumstance that, with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or
default) by any party to the Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which Parent becomes aware;
(B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or communication from any Financing Source with respect to any
(1) actual breach (or threatened breach), default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or any definitive

written request therefor to Parent.

        (d)    Alternate Debt Financing.    If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions

arrange, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) alternative financing from alternative sources on
terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions) not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters and any Fee Letters (after taking into account any "flex" provisions included in any related Fee Letter) and in
an amount sufficient to fund the Required Amount or such unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the "Alternate Debt
Financing"); and (ii) one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the "New
Debt Commitment Letters"), which New Debt Commitment Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole
or in part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith,
which may be delivered with the fee amounts, "flex" terms and other economic terms therein redacted in a customary manner so
long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the amount (below the Required Amount), conditionality, availability
or termination of the Alternate Debt Financing) to the Company. In the event that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained,
(A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Letters" or the "Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the
Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New
Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect; and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt
Financing" will mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

        (e)    Enforcement.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Section 6.5 will require, and in no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require,

pro forma financial statements and information and (B) attend accounting due diligence sessions and drafting sessions;

        (xi)  taking all corporate and other actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to
(A) permit the consummation of the Debt Financing (including distributing the proceeds of the Debt Financing, if any,
obtained by any of its Subsidiaries to the Surviving Corporation); and (B) cause the direct borrowing or incurrence of all of
the proceeds of the Debt Financing, including any high-yield debt financing, by the Surviving Corporation or any of its

documentation and other information about the Company and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested by Parent relating
to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations.

        (b)    Obligations of the Company.    Nothing in this Section 6.6 will require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
(i) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time for
which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Parent; (ii) enter into any
definitive agreement that is not contingent on the occurrence of the Effective Time; (iii) give any indemnities in connection with
the Debt Financing that are effective prior to the Effective Time; or (iv) take any action that, in the good faith determination of the
Company, (a) would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (b) create an
unreasonable risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In addition, (A) no
action, liability or obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing (other than customary representation
letters and authorization letters (including with respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information and the
accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related to the Debt Financing)) will be effective
until the Effective Time; and (B) except as set forth in Section 2.9(b)(ii), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to take any action (including the distribution or transfer by or through any non-U.S. Subsidiary of the Company, whether
by dividend, loan or otherwise, of any cash) pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument (other
than customary representation letters and authorization letters (including with respect to the presence or absence of material non-
public information and the accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related to the Debt
Financing)) that is not contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in
this Section 6.6 will require (1) any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion
or take any other action under this Section 6.6 that could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such
Representative; (2) the Company Board to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto prior to the Closing; and (3) the
Company and its Subsidiaries to take any action that would conflict with or violate its organizational documents, any applicable
Laws or result in a violation of breach of, or default under, any agreement to which the Company or any of it is Subsidiaries is a
party. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors (with respect to
any Subsidiary of the Company) or employees shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to
the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the
Closing and no directors of the Company that will not be continuing directors, acting in such capacity, shall be required to execute
or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the Financing.

        (c)    Updates.    The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its respective
reasonable best efforts, to update any Required Financing Information provided to Parent and the Financing Sources as may be
necessary so that such Required Financing Information (i) is Compliant, (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the
definition of "Required Financing Information" and (iii) would not, after giving effect to such update(s), cause the Marketing
Period to cease pursuant to the definition of "Marketing Period." For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may, to most effectively access
the financing markets, require the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries under this Section 6.6 at any time, and from
time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof and the Closing Date; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to each attempt to access the markets. The Company agrees to (i) file all reports on
Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and to the extent required to include financial information pursuant to Item 9.01 thereof, Form 8-K and
(ii) use reasonable best efforts to file all other Forms 8-K, in each case, required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the time periods required by the Exchange Act. In addition, if, in connection with
a marketing effort contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent reasonably requests the Company to file a Current
Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that contains material non-public information with respect to the Company and
its subsidiaries, which Parent reasonably determines (and the Company does not unreasonably object) to include in a customary
offering memorandum for the Debt Financing, then, the Company shall file such Current Report on Form 8-K.

        (d)    Use of Logos.    The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the
Financing so long as such logos are used (i) solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to harm or disparage the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) solely in connection with a
description of the Company, its business and products or the Merger; and (iii) in a manner consistent with the other terms and
conditions that the Company reasonably imposes.

        (e)    Confidentiality.    All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company or any of its
Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that
Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such information to any Financing Sources or prospective financing sources
and other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors)
so long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto; or (ii) are subject to other
confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a beneficiary.

        (f)    Reimbursement.    Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent will reimburse the Company for any documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection
with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.6.

        (g)    Indemnification.    The Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives will be indemnified and
held harmless by Parent from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys'
fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with their
cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the provision of information utilized in connection
therewith (other than to the extent any of the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Company and its Subsidiaries or, in each case, their respective Representatives).

Parent's obligations pursuant to Section 6.6(f) and this Section 6.6(g) are referred to collectively as the "Reimbursement
Obligations."

        (h)    No Exclusive Arrangements.    In no event will the Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
(which for this purpose will be deemed to include each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub) enter into any Contract prohibiting
or seeking to prohibit any bank or other potential provider of debt financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing to
any Person, in each case in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in connection with
the Merger.

        (i)    No Financing Condition.    Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Financing is not a
condition to the Closing. Subject to Section 9.8(b)(ii), if the Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each
continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Merger.

        6.7    Anti-Takeover Laws.     The Company and the Company Board will (a) take all actions within their power to ensure that no
"anti-takeover" Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including the Merger; and (b) if any "anti-takeover" Law is or may become applicable to the Merger, take all action within their
power to ensure that such transactions, including the Merger, may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and thereby and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on such transactions, including the Merger.

        6.8    Access.     At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and (2) Effective Time, the Company will and will cause
its Representatives and Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice from Parent, to the properties, offices, facilities, Contracts, Tax records, books and records and personnel of the
Company, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that the
Company reasonably determines that (a) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such
documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or information (so long as the Company has taken all
reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to disclose such information and to respond in a timely manner to all subsequent queries by
Parent and its Representatives based on such information on a basis that does not compromise the Company's attorney-client or other
privilege with respect thereto; or (c) access to a Contract in effect as of the date of this Agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate or
accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract (so long as the Company will have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such access and disclosure); or (d) such documents or information are directly pertinent to any adverse Legal
Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand. Nothing in this
Section 6.8 will be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives to prepare
any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company's reasonable security measures and insurance requirements
and will not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any
information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any

investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8. All requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.8 must
be directed to the Company's General Counsel or another person designated in writing by the Company.

        6.9    Section 16(b) Exemption.     The Company will take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions
of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by each individual who is a director or
executive officer of the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

        6.10    Directors' and Officers' Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance.     

        (a)    Indemnified Persons.    The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant
to any indemnification agreements between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective
current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time, to the extent such indemnification agreements are substantially consistent in all material respects with
the form of indemnification agreement provided to Parent prior to the date hereof), on the other hand (collectively, the
"Indemnified Persons"). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the
Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the
date of this Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any
manner except as required by applicable Law.

        (b)    Indemnification Obligation.    Without limiting the generality of Section 6.10(a), during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or pursuant to any
indemnification agreements with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in effect as of the Effective Time, each Indemnified
Person from and against any reasonable and documented costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or
compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that
such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged
action or omission, in such Indemnified Person's capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time); and
(ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition
of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries insolvent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b),
then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally
resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the defense
thereof after the Effective Time; (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel (the reasonable and
documented fees and

expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the
defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay any
amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, the Surviving Corporation
will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the
defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal
Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her
prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely
responsible). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek
the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Person (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

        (c)    D&O Insurance.    During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the D&O
Insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage,
conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the D&O Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant
to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount
paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"). If the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier.
Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the D&O Insurance pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Company may (or,
if the Parent requests, the Company will) purchase a prepaid "tail" policy (a "Tail Policy") with respect to the D&O Insurance from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier
so long as the annual cost for a Tail Policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company purchases a Tail
Policy prior to the Effective Time, then the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain such a Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such a Tail Policy
is in full force and effect.

        (d)    Successors and Assigns.    If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each case, proper
provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.

        (e)    No Impairment.    The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified
in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person (and their heirs and representatives) who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or a Tail Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person
or other person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and their heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries
pursuant to the D&O Insurance or a Tail Policy are

intended to be, following the Effective Time, third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if a
Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons (and their heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant
to the D&O Insurance or a Tail Policy) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the
Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law.

        (f)    Other Claims.    Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to
directors' and officers' insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

        6.11    Employee Matters.    

        (a)    Change of Control Acknowledgement.    Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of each of the Company Benefit Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.

        (b)    Existing Arrangements.    From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Company Benefit Plans and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance
with their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating
any such Company Benefit Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise
required pursuant to applicable Law.

        (c)    Employment; Benefits.    For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each
Continuing Employee the Company Benefit Plans (other than opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and, subject to
Section 6.11(b), individual employment agreements) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Company
Plans") at benefit levels that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the
date of this Agreement, and provide compensation and benefits to each Continuing Employee pursuant to such Company Plans;
(ii) provide compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits and,
subject to Section 6.11(b), individual employment agreements) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than opportunity to participate
in equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time ("Comparable Plans"); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and Comparable Plans such that each
Continuing Employee receives compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than opportunity to participate in equity-
based benefits and, subject to Section 6.11(b), individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are substantially similar
in the aggregate to the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than opportunity to participate in equity-based
benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
In each case, base compensation and target incentive compensation opportunity will not be decreased for a period of one year
following the Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during that period. For a period of one year following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide severance

benefits to eligible full-time regular employees no less favorable than the Company's past practices and severance calculation set
forth on Section 6.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, without regard to the right to exercise discretion to reduce such levels,
taking into account service both before and after the Closing.

        (d)    New Plans.    To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee at
or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of
service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement, but not for purposes of benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension or retiree health plans), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it
would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans
sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, the "New Plans") to the
extent that coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the "Old Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving
Corporation will undertake commercially reasonable efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions,
evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and the Surviving Corporation will undertake commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees
pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee.
Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time and will be subject to the vacation policies of the Surviving
Corporation as in effect from time to time; provided, that vacation accrued but unused as of the Closing shall remain available to
the same extent as under Company programs in effect as of the date hereof as applied to each Continuing Employee.

        (e)    No Third Person Beneficiary Rights.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, this
Section 6.11 will not be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject to
the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 6.11, require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time; (iii) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or be
deemed or construed to establish any Company Benefit Plan; or (iv) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person.

        (a)    Notification by the Company.    At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and
(2) Effective Time, the Company will give prompt notice to Parent: (i) of any notice or other communication received by the
Company from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or from any Person alleging that the consent of such

Proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the Merger; and (iii)(x) of any change, condition or event (including
any renewal, termination, or amendment of, or any proposed modification to, any Material Contract) that to the Company's
Knowledge would render or would reasonably be expected to render any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (y) of any failure or reasonably anticipated failure by the Company to comply with
or satisfy in any respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in
each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Article VII to fail to be satisfied at
the Closing (provided, however, that the Company's unintentional failure to give any notice under Section 6.13(a)(iii) shall not be
deemed a breach for purposes of the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b)). No such notification will affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of

Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub
to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing. No such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate
the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement apply to any information provided to the Company pursuant to this Section 6.13(b).

        (ii)    Company Board Recommendation Change.    If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f),
then the Company must promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) following such termination pay or cause to
be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

        (iii)    Superior Proposal.    If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company must
concurrently with such termination pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

        (iv)    Company Breach.    If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then the Company must
concurrently with such termination pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee an amount equal to that required to
reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for all fees and expenses (up to a maximum amount of
$5,500,000) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Parent
Expenses") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

        (c)    Parent Payment.    If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(g) (and such material breach or
material failure to perform by Parent is or would be the primary cause of the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 or
Section 7.3) or Section 8.1(i), then Parent must promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) following such termination
pay or cause to be paid to the Company or its designee an amount equal to $253,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Company.

        (d)    Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages.    The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company or
Parent be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than
one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (ii) the damages resulting from the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation; and (iii) without
these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Therefore, the Company Termination Fee (as well as the Parent
Expenses) or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, if, as and when required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8.3 will not
constitute a penalty but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Party receiving such amount in
the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger.

        (e)    Payments; Default.    The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of
the Merger and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails
to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or Parent fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to
Section 8.3(c) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a
Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company

as applicable, may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Reimbursement Obligations,
the last sentence of Section 6.2(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(e), and the Guarantors will remain obligated
with respect to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to the Guarantee (in each
case subject to the terms and conditions of the Guarantee)).

        (ii)    Parent.    Parent's receipt of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses to the extent owed pursuant

of Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates against (A) the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their
respective Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of
each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B)
collectively, the "Company Related Parties") in respect of this Agreement and the Merger, and upon payment of such
amount, none of the Company Related Parties will have any further monetary liability or obligation to Parent or Merger
Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates), as applicable,
will remain obligated with respect to, and the Parties, as applicable, may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the last sentence of Section 6.2(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.3(a), Section 8.3(b)(iv) and
Section 8.3(e), as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(f)(ii), and the payment of the Company
Termination Fee or Parent Expenses, will not relieve the Company from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement.

DGCL without receiving such approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions relating to the
Financing Sources set forth in Section 6.6(a), Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 9.3, Section 9.6, Section 9.10(b), Section 9.11, Section 9.14

        9.7    Severability.     In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The
Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

        9.8    Remedies.     

        (a)    Remedies Cumulative.    Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, subject in all
respects to this Section 9.8, Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Section 9.14 (and, in each case, the limitations set forth herein or therein),
any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred by this Agreement or by applicable Law on such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Transaction Document or otherwise, for the
avoidance of doubt, although the Company may, subject in all respects to this Section 9.8, Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and
Section 9.14 (and, in each case, the limitations set forth herein or therein), pursue both (i) a grant of specific performance, subject
in all respects to this Section 9.8, and (ii) payment of monetary damages pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 8.2(b) or the Parent
Termination Fee, if, as and when required pursuant to Section 8.3(c), under no circumstances will the Company, directly or
indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (1) both a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) and the occurrence of the Closing, on
the one hand, and (x) payment of any monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance)
whatsoever or (y) payment of any of the Parent Termination Fee and the amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to
Section 8.3(f)(i) or the Reimbursement Obligations, on the other hand; or (2) both payment of any monetary damages (including
any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance) whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of any of the Parent Termination
Fee and the amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to Section 8.3(f)(i) or the Reimbursement Obligations, on the other hand.

        (b)    Specific Performance.    

        (i)    Irreparable Damage.    The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it by this Agreement in order to consummate the Merger)
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject
in all respects to Section 9.8(b)(ii), (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity, to an

injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement; and (B) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

        (ii)    Specific Performance in Respect of Financing.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document or otherwise to the contrary, and subject in all respects to this Section 9.8(b)(ii), it is
acknowledged and agreed that Parent has an obligation hereunder to cause the Equity Financing to be funded, including by
exercising its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, and such obligation of Parent, and the right of the Company to
specific performance in connection with enforcing such obligation of Parent (whether under this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letter) and the obligation of Parent to consummate the Merger, will be subject to the requirements that (A) all
of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing);
(B) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded in full at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing; (C) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger on the date required pursuant to Section 2.3; and
(D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement
to cause the Closing to occur, and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing within two Business Days after
delivery of the Company's irrevocable written confirmation. In no event will the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to
enforce specifically Parent's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt
Financing has not been funded in full (or will not be funded in full at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing). In addition, it is acknowledged and agreed that the Company will be entitled to specific performance to cause
Parent and Merger Sub to comply with their obligations under Section 6.5(b) to enforce their respective rights under the
Debt Commitment Letters to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letters if (1) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been and continue to be satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied
at the Closing); (2) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger on the date required pursuant to Section 2.3; and
(3) all of the conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing provided by the Debt Commitment Letters have been
satisfied (other the receipt of the Equity Financing and the satisfaction of those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing).

        (iii)    No Objections.    The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants,
obligations and agreements of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case in
compliance with this Agreement, will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or other security.

Merger and the Guarantee, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such
other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself
and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event that

(vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Guarantee or the Merger in any court other
than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the
Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law.

        (b)    Jurisdiction for Financing Sources.    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties
acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letters, or the performance of services thereunder or related will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each Party hereto submits
for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or
permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that
service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in the
Debt Commitment Letters will be effective service of process against them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such
court; (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which any of them may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal
Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of New York.

        9.11    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.     EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT

TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE GUARANTEE, THE FINANCING LETTERS OR THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH

FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

        9.12    Counterparts.     This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will
be considered one and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to
the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"),
will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect
as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a
signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic
Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.

        9.13    No Limitation.     It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and
effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, (a) the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this
Agreement will be construed to be cumulative; (b) each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement will be
given full, separate and independent effect; and (c) nothing set forth in any provision in this Agreement will (except to the extent expressly
stated) in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision of this Agreement.

        9.14    Non-recourse.     Each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its Related Parties, that all Legal Proceedings (whether in Contract
or in tort, in Law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate,
limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that may be based
upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to: (a) this Agreement, any of the other
Transaction Documents or the Merger (including the Financing) or any other transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder; (b) the
negotiation, execution or performance this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents (including any representation or
warranty made in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents); (c) any breach or
violation of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents; and (d) any failure of the Merger (including the Financing) or any
other transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder to be consummated, in each case, may be made only against (and are those solely
of) the Persons that are, in the case of this Agreement, expressly identified as parties to this Agreement, and in the case of the other
Transaction Documents, Persons expressly identified as parties to such Transaction Documents and in accordance with, and subject to the
terms and conditions of, this Agreement or such Transaction Documents, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or
any of the other Transaction Documents to the contrary, each Party agrees, on behalf of itself and its Related Parties, that no recourse
under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or in connection with the Merger (including the Financing) or any other
transactions contemplated hereunder or under any other Transaction Document will be sought or had against any other Person, including
any Related Party, and no other Person, including any Related Party, will have any liabilities or obligations (whether in Contract or in

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL 

August 26, 2016

Board of Directors
Rackspace Hosting, Inc.
1 Fanatical Place
City of Windcrest
San Antonio, TX 78218

Ladies and Gentlemen:

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Inception Parent, Inc.
("Parent") and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Shares"), of Rackspace
Hosting, Inc. (the "Company") of the $32.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of August 26, 2016 (the "Agreement"), by and among Parent, Inception Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), and the Company.

        Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading,
research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman,
Sachs & Co. and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic
interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities,
derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, or any of their
respective affiliates and third parties, including Apollo Global Management, LLC ("Apollo"), an affiliate of Parent, and any of its affiliates
and portfolio companies, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the Agreement (the
"Transaction"). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and have participated in certain of the negotiations
leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in connection with the Transaction, the principal portion of which is
contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and
indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We have provided certain financial advisory and/or
underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received, and
may receive, compensation, including having acted as book runner with respect to the issuance of its 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024
(aggregate principal amount $500 million) in November 2015. We also have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting
services to Apollo and/or its affiliates and portfolio companies from time to time for which our Investment Banking Division has received,
and may receive, compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to Athlon Energy, a portfolio company of funds affiliated with
Apollo, in connection with its sale in November 2014; as co-manager with respect to the offering by Protection One, Inc. and ASG
Security, portfolio companies of funds affiliated with Apollo, of first and second lien term loan facilities (aggregate principal amount
$1.355 billion) in May 2015; as financial advisor to Apollo in connection with the sale of Great Wolf Resorts, a portfolio company of
funds affiliated with Apollo, in May 2015; as joint bookrunner with respect to the issuance by EP Energy LLC, a portfolio company of
funds affiliated with Apollo, of its 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (aggregate principal amount $800 million) in July 2015; as
financial advisor to Gala Coral Group Limited, a portfolio company of funds affiliated with Apollo, in connection with its pending merger
announced in July 2015; and as joint bookrunner with respect to the issuance by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Limited, a portfolio
company of funds affiliated with Apollo, of its 4.625% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (aggregate principal amount $600 million) in
November 2015. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to

the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates and Apollo and its affiliates and portfolio companies, for which our Investment
Banking Division may receive compensation. Affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co. also may have co-invested with Apollo and its affiliates
from time to time and may have invested in limited partnership units of affiliates of Apollo from time to time and may do so in the future.

        In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual
Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2015; certain interim reports to stockholders and
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly
available research analyst reports for the Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its
management, as approved for our use by the Company (the "Forecasts"). We have also held discussions with members of the senior
management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future
prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares; compared certain financial and stock market
information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the
financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the data center industry, technology infrastructure industry, and in other
industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of
the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any
responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We
have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative, or other off-
balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or
appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory, or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the
Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis.
We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of
any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.

        Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of
the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory,
tax, or accounting matters. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its
affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $32.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We do not
express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of
any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction,
including the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid
or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction,
whether relative to the $32.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the
Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub or the ability of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to pay their

respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in
effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or
reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the
opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its
consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with
respect to such Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman, Sachs & Co.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $32.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the
holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

Annex C 

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE 

§262. Appraisal rights. 

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of
the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in
this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include
what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository
representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the
depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)
(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further
provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the
merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger
or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository
receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be
either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a.
and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or
§ 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of
the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated



8/17/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1107694/000104746916015832/a2229858zdefm14a.htm

by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall
apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word
"corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available
for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or
consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted
for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in
accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to
subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent
corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares
shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal
of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the
stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote
against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do
so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation,
the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with
this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or
consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation
within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who
are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any
or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may,
and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the
effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date
of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice,
demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be

to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second

notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock
of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or
(ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first
notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the
offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need
only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's shares
in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the
corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima
facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice,
each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the
notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record
date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date
shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw
such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the
consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or
resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this
section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from
the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by
the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given
by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of
Wilmington, Delaware or such

publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the
costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold
stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders
of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair
value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall
be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time
to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose
name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated
stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates
representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such
surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to
be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided
in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective
date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in
subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such
stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the
right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery
shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or
resulting corporation.

Company (the "Merger"), with the Company to survive the Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.

        C.    As of the date hereof, the Existing Shares (as defined herein) set forth opposite each Principal Stockholder's name on

agreement that would (i) reasonably be expected to result in a material breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company under the Merger Agreement or (ii) prevent or materially delay, or would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, or

any Stockholders (clauses (A) through (C), the "Required Votes"). No Principal Stockholder shall take or agree to take any action which it
has agreed not to take in this Section 1.

        2.     No Transfers or Solicitation.

        (a)   Restrictions on Transfers.    Absent the prior written consent of Parent and except as set forth in Schedule 2(a) attached hereto,
each Principal Stockholder hereby agrees that, from the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the end of the Term of this Agreement and
(ii) the date on which the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained, it shall not, (A) Transfer, or enter into any contract, option or other
arrangement or understanding providing for the Transfer of any of such Principal Stockholder's Covered Shares other than (1) any Transfer
to a Permitted Transferee, but only if, in each case, prior to the effectiveness of such Transfer, such Permitted Transferee agrees in writing
to be bound by the applicable terms hereof and notice of such Transfer is delivered to Parent pursuant to Section 8(a) or (2) a Transfer
pursuant to any trust or will of such Principal Stockholder or by the Laws of intestate succession, (B) deposit any Covered Shares into a
voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto that is

cause each of its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing any non-public information) or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries regarding, or the making or
submission of any proposal, indication of interest or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations that could reasonably be expected to lead to,

Principal Stockholder or Affiliate may participate in discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal if, at
such time, the Company is permitted to engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding an Acquisition Proposal pursuant
to the Merger Agreement.

        3.     No Agreement as Director or Officer.    Weston makes no agreement or understanding in this Agreement in Weston's capacity as
a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (if Weston holds such office), and nothing in this Agreement: (a) will limit or
affect any actions or omissions taken by Weston in his capacity as such a director or officer, including in exercising rights under the
Merger Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or (b) will be construed to prohibit, limit

Covered Shares shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of such occurrence and (ii) this Agreement and the obligations

        (b)   Commencement or Participation in Actions.    Each Principal Stockholder hereby agrees not to commence or join in, and to take

        (c)   Appraisal Rights or Rights of Dissent.    Each Principal Stockholder hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to exercise, any
rights of appraisal or rights of dissent from the Merger that such Principal Stockholder may have with respect to the Covered Shares.

        (d)   Publication and Disclosure.    Each Principal Stockholder hereby agrees to permit the Company to publish and disclose,
including in filings with the SEC and in the press release announcing the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the
"Announcement Release"), this Agreement and such Principal Stockholder's identity and ownership of the Covered Shares and the nature
of such Principal Stockholder's commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement, in each case, to the extent the
Company reasonably determines that such information is required to be disclosed by applicable Law (or in the case of the Announcement

Stockholders).

        (e)   Consent.    Each Principal Stockholder set forth on Schedule 1(b) hereby agrees to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all

        5.     Representations and Warranties of the Principal Stockholder.    Each Principal Stockholder represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as to itself as follows:

Laws and as created by this Agreement).

generally and the availability of equitable remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

        (e)   No Conflicts.    Except as set forth in Schedule 5(e) attached hereto, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such
Principal Stockholder does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the compliance with the provisions
hereof will not, conflict with or violate any Laws or agreements binding upon such Principal Stockholder or such Principal Stockholder's
Covered Shares, nor require any authorization, consent or approval of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, except in each case for
filings with the SEC by such Principal Stockholder or as would not impact such Principal Stockholder's ability to perform or comply with
its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

        6.     Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub.    Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant

period following the Term, the Principal Stockholders may, without the consent of Parent, grant a consent or execute any written
consent in or with respect to any or all of the Covered Shares, or otherwise enter into a Contract for the Transfer of Covered

or to such other address as any Party will specify by written notice so given, and such notice will be deemed to have been delivered as of
the date so telecommunicated, personally delivered or mailed. Any Party to this Agreement may notify any other Party of any changes to
the address or any of the other details specified in this paragraph; provided, however, that such notification will only be effective on the
date specified in such notice or two (2) Business Days after the notice is given, whichever is later. Rejection or other refusal to accept or
the inability to deliver because of changed address of which no notice was given will be deemed to be receipt of the notice as of the date of
such rejection, refusal or inability to deliver. The failure of any Party to give notice will not relieve any other Party of its obligations under
this Agreement except to the extent that such Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice.

        (b)   Interpretation.

        (i)    When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such reference will be to a Section of or Exhibit to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless the context otherwise
requires, (i) "or" is disjunctive but not necessarily exclusive, (ii) words in the singular include the plural and vice versa, and

pronoun in reference to a Party hereto includes the masculine, feminine or neuter, as the context may require. A day means a
calendar day unless specified as a Business Day. Except as otherwise expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, any
provision herein which contemplates the agreement, approval or consent of, or exercise of any right of, a Party, such Party may
give or withhold such agreement, approval or consent, or exercise such right, in its sole and absolute discretion, the Parties hereby
expressly disclaiming any implied duty of good faith and fair dealing or similar concept.

        (ii)    The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

        (c)   Counterparts.    This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement and will become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Party, it being
understood that each Party need not sign the same counterpart.

        (d)   Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries.    This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits referred to in this
Agreement) (i) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes and cancels all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, express or implied, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and (ii) is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any Person any rights or remedies hereunder other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

        (e)   Amendment.    This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

        (f)    Extension; Waiver.    Any agreement on the part of a Party to (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of another Party or (ii) waive (A) any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or
(B) compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement, in each case, will be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

        (g)   Governing Law; Jurisdiction, Enforcement.    This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. In addition, each of the
Parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns, will be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court
of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereto by this Agreement irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this
Section 8(g), (b) any claim that it

or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise)
and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may
not be enforced in or by such courts.

        (h)   Waiver of Jury Trial.    EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND SUCH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED
IN THIS SECTION 8(h).

        (i)    Assignment.    Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned by any of the
Parties hereto (whether by sale of stock, operation of law, in connection with a merger or sale of substantially all of the assets, or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to do so will be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable, by the Parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.

        (j)    Severability.    Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the sole extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the
remainder of such term or provision and the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in any jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted to be only so broad as to be enforceable.

        (k)   No Ownership Interest.    Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed, upon execution, to vest in Parent any direct or
indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Covered Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and
relating to the Covered Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Principal Stockholders, and Parent shall have no authority to
manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any
power or authority to direct the Principal Stockholders in the voting of any of the Covered Shares, except as otherwise provided herein.

        (l)    Certain Definitions.    For the purposes of this Agreement, capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. Certain other terms have the meanings ascribed to them below or
elsewhere in this Agreement.

        "Additional Owned Shares" means, with respect to a Principal Stockholder, all such Company Capital Stock that are owned of
record or beneficially by such Principal Stockholder and acquired after the date hereof (including any Company Capital Stock
acquired by means of purchase, dividend or distribution, or issued upon the exercise of any stock options to acquire Company
Capital Stock or warrants or the conversion of any convertible securities or otherwise).

        "Affiliate" has the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that for purposes of this Agreement, none
of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective officers or directors) shall constitute an Affiliate of any Principal
Stockholder.

        "beneficial ownership" (and related terms such as "beneficially owned" or "beneficial owner") has the meaning set forth in
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act.

        "Covered Shares" means, with respect to a Principal Stockholder, the Existing Shares, excluding the shares of Company
Capital Stock set forth on Schedule 1(b) hereto, and Additional Owned Shares.

        "Existing Shares" of a Principal Stockholder means the shares of Company Capital Stock that are beneficially owned by the
specified Principal Stockholder as of the date hereof, as set forth opposite such Principal Stockholder's name on Schedule 1(a)
hereto.

        "Permitted Transferee" means, with respect to a Principal Stockholder, (A) a spouse, lineal descendant or antecedent, brother
or sister, adopted child or grandchild of the spouse of any child, adopted child, grandchild or adopted grandchild of Weston,
(B) any trust, the trustees of which include only the Persons named in clause (A) and the beneficiaries of which include only the
Persons named in clause (A), or (C) any partnership or limited liability company, all partners or members of which include only the
Persons named in clause (A), any trust named in clause (B) and one or more of the Principal Stockholders or their Affiliates;
provided, that Weston continues to have sole voting control over such Affiliates.

        "Transfer" means, with respect to a Covered Share, the direct or indirect transfer, pledge, hypothecation, encumbrance,
assignment, tender in any tender or exchange offer or other disposition (whether by sale, merger, consolidation, liquidation,
dissolution, dividend, distribution, testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise), voluntarily or involuntarily, of such
Covered Share or the beneficial ownership thereof, and each agreement, arrangement, option or understanding, whether or not in
writing, to effect any of the foregoing. As a verb, "Transfer" shall have a correlative meaning.

        (m)  Remedies.    The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are hereby waived.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties agree and acknowledge that in no event and under no circumstances (x) will
Parent or Merger Sub seek, directly or indirectly, to recover money damages arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (y) will a Principal Stockholder or any of its respective Affiliates be liable for damages under or in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

        (n)   Facsimile Signatures.    A signature page to this Agreement, the agreements referred to herein, and each other agreement or
instrument entered into in connection herewith or therewith or contemplated hereby or thereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, that
contains a copy of a Party's signature and that is sent by such Party or its agent with the apparent intention (as reasonably evidenced by the
actions of such Party or its agent) that it constitute such Party's execution and delivery of this Agreement or any such other document,
including a document sent by means of a facsimile machine or electronic transmission in portable document format ("pdf"), will be treated
in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were
the original signed version thereof delivered in person. Minor variations in the form of the signature page, including footers from earlier
versions of this Agreement or any such other document, will be disregarded in determining the Party's intent or the effectiveness of such
signature. At the request of any Party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other Party hereto or thereto will re execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No Party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument will raise the use of a
facsimile machine or electronic transmission in pdf to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or electronic transmission in pdf as a defense to the formation or
enforceability of a contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense.
