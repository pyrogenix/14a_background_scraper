Dear Shareholder:

        You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the shareholders of CU Bancorp, a California corporation, which we refer to
as CUB, which we will hold at City Club Los Angeles—Santa Monica Room, 555 South Flower Street, 51st Floor, Los Angeles,
California 90071, on August 24, 2017, at 8:30 a.m., local time. At the special meeting, holders of CUB common shares will be asked to
approve the principal terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, which we refer to as the merger agreement, dated as of April 5, 2017, by
and between PacWest Bancorp, which we refer to as PacWest, and CUB, pursuant to which CUB will merge with and into PacWest, with
PacWest as the surviving corporation, which we refer to as the merger, and which proposal we refer to as the merger proposal.
Immediately following the merger, California United Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CUB, will merge with and into Pacific Western
Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of PacWest, with Pacific Western Bank as the surviving bank.

        At the effective time of the merger, each CUB common share, other than excluded shares and dissenting shares, will be converted into
the right to receive (i) $12.00 in cash and (ii) 0.5308 of a share of PacWest common stock, referred to as the exchange ratio, with cash paid
in lieu of a fractional share of PacWest common stock. The merger agreement provides that CUB may terminate the merger agreement if
(i) the volume weighted average price of PacWest common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the date that is five
business days prior to the closing date, which we refer to as the determination period, falls below $44.84 per share and (ii) the volume-
weighted average price of PacWest common stock over the determination period underperforms the average KBW Regional Banking
Index, referred to as the KBW Index, for the determination period by more than 15%. If CUB elects to exercise such termination right,
then PacWest may reinstate the agreement after increasing the exchange ratio or cash consideration according to formulas set forth in the
merger agreement such that the value of the merger consideration is intended to fix at $35.80 per share, as adjusted for any decline in the
KBW Index. For a more complete discussion of the termination rights, please refer to the section of this proxy statement/prospectus
entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement."

        The market value of the stock portion of the merger consideration will fluctuate with the price of PacWest common stock. Based on
the closing price of PacWest common stock on April 5, 2017, the last trading day before the public announcement of the signing of the
merger agreement, the value of the per share merger consideration payable to holders of CUB common shares was $39.45. Based on the
closing price of PacWest common stock on July 21, 2017, the last practicable date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the
value of the per share merger consideration payable to holders of CUB common shares was $37.67. You should obtain current price
quotations for CUB common shares and PacWest common stock. CUB common shares are traded on NASDAQ under the symbol
"CUNB" and PacWest common stock is traded on NASDAQ under the symbol "PACW."

        The merger is intended to qualify, and the obligation of PacWest and CUB to complete the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of
legal opinions from their respective counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify, as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. You generally will recognize gain (but not loss) upon receipt of the merger consideration in
exchange for CUB common shares in the merger in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of gain realized (i.e., the excess of the
sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of the PacWest common stock received pursuant to the merger over your adjusted tax
basis in the CUB common shares surrendered in the exchange) and (2) the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger (excluding any
cash received in lieu of a fractional share of PacWest common stock).

        The board of directors of CUB has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and
determined that the merger agreement and the transactions

contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best interests of CUB and its shareholders. The board of directors recommends that the CUB
common shareholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal.

        At the special meeting, CUB common shareholders will also be asked to vote on a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of
the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting
to approve the merger proposal, which we refer to as the adjournment proposal. The board of directors recommends that the CUB common
shareholders vote "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

        Your vote is very important. To ensure your representation at the special meeting, please complete and return the enclosed proxy card
or submit your proxy by telephone or through the Internet. Whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting, please vote promptly.
Submitting a proxy now will not prevent you from being able to vote in person at the special meeting.

        If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee you should follow the directions provided by your
broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Without those
instructions, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as voting against the merger proposal and against the
adjournment proposal.

        This proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information about the proposed merger. You are encouraged to read the
entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the appendices and the documents incorporated by reference, carefully. In particular,
you should read the "Risk Factors" section beginning on page 28 for a discussion of the risks you should consider in evaluating the
proposed merger and how it will affect you.

        We thank you for your continued support and look forward to seeing you at the special meeting.

        Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the
merger, the issuance of the PacWest Bancorp common stock in connection with the merger or the other transactions described in
this document, or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosures in this document. Any representation to the contrary is
a criminal offense.

        The securities to be issued in connection with the merger are not savings accounts, deposits or other obligations of any bank
or savings association and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.

        If you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares, please call CU Bancorp Investor Relations at (818) 257-7700.

This document is dated July 24, 2017 and is first being mailed to CU Bancorp shareholders on or about July 26, 2017.

   
 Sincerely,

  

 David I. Rainer
 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Table of Contents

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        The following are answers to certain questions that you may have regarding the special meeting of shareholders of CU Bancorp,
which we refer to as the special meeting. You should carefully read the remainder of this document because the information in this section
may not provide all the information that might be important to you in determining how to vote. Additional important information is also
contained in the appendices to, and the documents incorporated by reference in, this document.

Q: WHAT IS THE MERGER? 

A. PacWest Bancorp, a Delaware corporation, referred to as PacWest, and CU Bancorp, a California corporation, referred to as CUB,
have entered into an agreement and plan of merger, which we refer to as the merger agreement, pursuant to which and subject to
the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, CUB will merge with and into PacWest, with PacWest continuing as the
surviving corporation, which transaction is referred to as the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Appendix A to
this document. Immediately following the merger, California United Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CUB, referred to as CU
Bank, will merge with and into Pacific Western Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of PacWest, with Pacific Western Bank
continuing as the surviving bank, which transaction is referred to as the bank merger. In order to complete these transactions, the
CUB shareholders must approve the principal terms of the merger agreement, and the applicable banking regulators must approve
both the merger and the bank merger. 

Q: WHY AM I RECEIVING THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS? 

A. CUB is sending these materials to its shareholders to help them decide how to vote their CUB common shares with respect to the
merger agreement and other matters to be considered at the special meeting.

The merger cannot be completed unless CUB common shareholders approve the principal terms of the merger agreement. CUB is
holding a special meeting of its shareholders to vote on the proposal to approve the principal terms of the merger agreement as well
as other related matters. Information about this special meeting, the merger and the other business to be considered by shareholders
at the special meeting is contained in this document.

This document constitutes both a proxy statement of CUB and a prospectus of PacWest. It is a proxy statement because the CUB
board of directors is soliciting proxies from CUB common shareholders using this document with respect to the matters to be
considered at the special meeting. It is a prospectus because PacWest, in connection with the merger, is offering shares of its
common stock in exchange for outstanding CUB common shares in the merger.

Q: WHAT WILL CUB SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVE IN THE MERGER? 

A: In the merger, each CUB common share owned by a CUB shareholder, other than excluded shares and dissenting shares, will be
converted into the right to receive (i) $12.00 in cash, referred to as the cash consideration, and (ii) 0.5308 of a share of PacWest
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, referred to as PacWest common stock, which ratio is referred to as the exchange ratio,
subject to adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement and as further described in the following question and answer and in the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement." The cash consideration and PacWest common
stock to be exchanged for each CUB common share is referred to collectively as the merger consideration. For each fractional
share that would otherwise be issued, PacWest will pay cash in an amount equal to the fraction of a share of PacWest common
stock which the holder would otherwise be entitled to receive multiplied by the volume-weighted average price of PacWest
common stock as quoted on

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543643/000104746917004755/a2232770zdefm14a.htm 10/214

Table of Contents

the NASDAQ over the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth business day immediately prior to the closing date. No
interest will be paid or accrue on cash payable to holders in lieu of fractional shares.

This 20 consecutive trading day average price is referred to as the PacWest average closing price; the fifth business day
immediately prior to the closing date is referred to as the determination date; and the 20 consecutive trading day period ending on
the determination date is referred to as the determination period.

Based on the closing price of PacWest common stock on April 5, 2017, the value of the per share merger consideration payable to
holders of CUB common shares was $39.45. Based on the closing price of PacWest common stock on July 21, 2017, the last
practicable date before the date of this document, the value of the per share merger consideration payable to holders of CUB
common shares was $37.67.

Q: WILL THE VALUE OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION CHANGE BETWEEN THE DATE OF THIS DOCUMENT
AND THE TIME THE MERGER IS COMPLETED? 

A: Yes. Although the number of shares of PacWest common stock that CUB shareholders will receive in the merger is fixed, other
than in certain circumstances described below, the value of the merger consideration will fluctuate between the date of this
document and the completion of the merger based upon the market value of PacWest common stock. Any fluctuation in the market
price of PacWest common stock after the date of this document will change the value of the shares of PacWest common stock that
CUB shareholders will receive.

In addition, the merger agreement provides that CUB may terminate the merger agreement if:

• the PacWest average closing price is less than $44.84 per share (with a proportionate adjustment for any stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of the
merger agreement and the determination date); and 

• the quotient of the PacWest average closing price divided by $52.75 is less than (i) the quotient of the average price of the
KBW Regional Banking Index, referred to as the KBW Index, during the determination period (as defined below) divided
by 105.39, which quotient is referred to as the index ratio, minus (ii) 0.15.

If CUB elects to terminate the merger agreement and provides written notice thereof to PacWest, then within two business days
following PacWest's receipt of such notice, PacWest may elect to reinstate the merger and related transactions, and adjust the
exchange ratio to equal the lesser of (i) the quotient of $23.80 divided by the PacWest average closing price and (ii) (a) the quotient
of $23.80 divided by the PacWest average closing price (b) multiplied by the index ratio. Alternatively, PacWest may elect not to
adjust the exchange ratio, and, in lieu thereof, may increase the cash consideration per CUB common share such that the value of
the total consideration received for each share is the same as if the exchange ratio had been adjusted as described above.

For more information, please see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement."

Q: WHAT HAPPENS TO CUB EQUITY AWARDS IN THE MERGER? 

A: CUB Stock Options.    At the effective time of the merger, referred to as the effective time, each outstanding option to acquire CUB
common shares under CUB's equity incentive plans, referred to as a CUB stock option, whether vested or unvested, will be
cancelled and will entitle the holder of such option to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of

common shares subject to such option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) an amount equal to (1) $12.00 in cash plus (2) the product
of the PacWest average closing price and 0.5308, minus (B) the exercise price per CUB common share underlying such option, less
any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.

CUB Restricted Shares and RSUs.    At the effective time, any vesting conditions applicable to outstanding restricted share awards
and restricted stock units under CUB's equity incentive plans, referred to, respectively, as the CUB restricted shares and the CUB
RSUs, will automatically accelerate in full and such CUB restricted shares and CUB RSUs will be converted into, and become
exchanged for, the merger consideration, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting.

Q: WHEN WILL THE MERGER BE COMPLETED? 

A: PacWest and CUB are working to complete the merger as soon as practicable. The parties are seeking regulatory approval by the
fourth quarter of 2017, with the consummation of the merger to occur as soon as practicable thereafter. Neither PacWest nor CUB
know, however, the actual date on which the merger will be completed because it is subject to factors beyond each company's
control, including whether or when the required regulatory approvals and the CUB shareholder approval will be received. For more
information, please see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger." 

Q: WHO IS ENTITLED TO VOTE? 

A: Holders of record of CUB common shares at the close of business on June 30, 2017, which is the date that the CUB board of
directors has fixed as the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to vote at the special meeting. 

Q: WHAT CONSTITUTES A QUORUM? 

A: A majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for transacting business at the
special meeting. Proxies marked as abstaining on any matter to be acted upon by shareholders will be counted as represented at the
meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. 

Q: WHAT AM I BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON AND WHY IS THIS APPROVAL NECESSARY? 

A: CUB common shareholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals: 

1. to approve the principal terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 5, 2017, by and between CUB and
PacWest, as such agreement may be amended from time to time, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A, referred to as
the merger proposal; and 

2. to approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including adjournments to permit
further solicitation of proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger
proposal, referred to as the adjournment proposal.

Shareholder approval of the merger proposal, referred to as the CUB shareholder approval, is required to complete the merger.
CUB will transact no business at the special meeting other than as listed above.

Table of Contents

Q: WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE EACH PROPOSAL AT THE SPECIAL MEETING? 

A: The Merger Proposal:    The affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding CUB common shares entitled to vote on the proposal is
required to approve the merger proposal. 

The Adjournment Proposal:    The adjournment proposal requires a vote that satisfies two criteria: (i) the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present, and (ii) the shares voting
affirmatively must also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum.

Q: ARE THERE ANY VOTING AGREEMENTS WITH EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS? 

A: Yes. Each of the directors of CUB, in his or her capacity as a shareholder of CUB, has entered into a voting agreement with
PacWest, the form of which is attached as Appendix B, in which such director has agreed to vote all CUB common shares that he
or she owns and has the power to vote in favor of the merger proposal and any other matter that is required to be approved by the
shareholders of CUB to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The directors also agreed to vote against
any proposal made in opposition to the approval of the principal terms of the merger agreement or in competition with the merger
agreement and against any acquisition proposal. As of the close of business on the record date, CUB's directors beneficially owned,
in the aggregate, 1,095,309 CUB common shares, allowing them to exercise approximately 6.14% of the voting power of CUB
common shares (which does not include shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options or upon the vesting of CUB RSUs that
were not outstanding as of the close of business on the record date). 

Q: WHAT DOES THE CUB BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMEND? 

A: The CUB board of directors recommends that CUB shareholders vote "FOR" the merger proposal and "FOR" the adjournment
proposal. 

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO NOW? 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this document, please vote your CUB common shares as soon
as possible so that such shares will be represented at the special meeting. Please follow the instructions set forth on the proxy card
or on the voting instruction form provided by the record holder if your CUB common shares are held in the name of your broker,
bank or other nominee. 

Q: HOW DO I VOTE? 

A: If you are a CUB common shareholder of record as of the close of business on the record date, you may submit your proxy before
the special meeting in one of the following ways: 

• use the telephone number shown on your proxy card; 

• visit the website shown on your proxy card to vote via the Internet; or 

• complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

You may also cast your vote in person at the special meeting.

If your CUB common shares are held in "street name," through a broker, bank or other nominee, that institution will send you
separate instructions describing the procedure for voting such shares. "Street name" shareholders who wish to vote at the meeting
will need to obtain a proxy form from their broker, bank or other nominee.

Q: HOW MANY VOTES DO I HAVE? 

A: You are entitled to one vote for each CUB common share that you owned as of the close of business on the record date. As of the
close of business on the record date, there were approximately 17,831,131 outstanding CUB common shares entitled to vote. As of
that date, approximately 8.27% of such outstanding CUB common shares were beneficially owned by the directors and executive
officers of CUB and their affiliates. 

Q: WHEN AND WHERE IS THE SPECIAL MEETING? 

A: The special meeting will be held at City Club Los Angeles—Santa Monica Room, 555 South Flower Street, 51st Floor, Los
Angeles, California 90071 at 8:30 a.m., local time, on August 24, 2017. Subject to space availability, all CUB common
shareholders as of the close of business on the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the special meeting. Since
seating may be limited, admission to the special meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration and seating will
begin at 8:00 a.m., local time. 

Q: IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME" BY A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE, WILL MY
BROKER, BANK OR OTHER NOMINEE VOTE MY SHARES FOR ME? 

A: If your CUB common shares are held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide the record holder of
your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or
other nominee. Please note that you may not vote shares held in "street name" by returning a proxy card directly to CUB or by
voting in person at the special meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy," which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other
nominee.

Brokers who hold shares in "street name" for the beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their
discretion on "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from the beneficial owner. However, brokers are not
allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters that are "non-routine" without specific
instructions from the beneficial owner. Both proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are considered "non-routine" matters
and, therefore, brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting power on these matters.

If you are a CUB common shareholder and you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares,
then your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares on either the merger proposal or the adjournment proposal.

• For the merger proposal, shares not represented at the special meeting are still considered outstanding and, therefore, will
have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. The merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority
of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. Therefore, the failure of a holder of CUB common shares to provide its bank,
broker or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. 

• The adjournment proposal requires a vote that satisfies two criteria: (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present, and (ii) the shares voting affirmatively must
also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum. Your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary
authority to vote your shares on the special meeting proposals without your instructions. Consequently, failure to provide
instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote will result in your shares not being represented at the
special meeting. Accordingly, for purposes of the adjournment proposal, your shares will not affect the outcome under
clause (i), which recognizes

Table of Contents

only actual votes cast. However, your shares will affect the outcome under clause (ii) if the number of shares voting
affirmatively, though a majority of the shares represented and voted, does not constitute a majority of the required quorum.

Q: WHAT IF I ABSTAIN OR DO NOT VOTE? 

A: For purposes of the special meeting, an abstention occurs when a shareholder attends the special meeting, either in person or
represented by proxy, but abstains from voting.

Abstentions will be counted as represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum
for all matters to be voted on at the special meeting.

For the merger proposal, if a CUB common shareholder present in person at the special meeting abstains from voting, or responds
by proxy with an "abstain" vote, it will have the same effect as a vote cast "AGAINST" the proposal. If a CUB common
shareholder is not present in person at the special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will also have the same effect as a vote
cast "AGAINST" the proposal.

The adjournment proposal requires a vote that satisfies two criteria: (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented
and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present, and (ii) the shares voting affirmatively must also constitute at least
a majority of the required quorum. Accordingly, for purposes of the adjournment proposal, abstentions will not affect the outcome
under clause (i), which recognizes only actual votes cast. However, abstentions will affect the outcome under clause (ii) if the
number of shares voting affirmatively, though a majority of the shares represented and voting, does not constitute a majority of the
required quorum.

Q: WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I RETURN MY PROXY OR VOTING INSTRUCTION CARD WITHOUT INDICATING
HOW TO VOTE? 

A: If you hold your CUB common shares in your name as a shareholder of record, and you sign and return your proxy card without
indicating how to vote on any particular proposal, the CUB common shares represented by your proxy will be voted "FOR" the
merger proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

If you hold your CUB common shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee and you do not give your broker,
bank or other nominee instructions on how to vote, your broker, bank or other nominee will not be able to vote your CUB common
shares on either of the proposals at the special meeting and your CUB common shares will not be represented at the special
meeting.

Q: MAY I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE DELIVERED MY PROXY OR VOTING INSTRUCTION CARD? 

A: Yes. If you hold your CUB common shares in your name as a shareholder of record, you may change your vote at any time before
your proxy is voted at the special meeting. You may do so in one of four ways: 

• first, by sending a notice of revocation stating that you would like to revoke your proxy; 

• second, by sending a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card; 

• third, by logging onto the Internet website specified on your proxy card in the same manner you would submit your proxy
electronically or by calling the telephone number specified on your proxy card, in each case if you were eligible to do so
and following the instructions on the proxy card; or

• fourth, by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the CUB special meeting will not in itself
constitute the revocation of a proxy.

If you are a CUB shareholder of record and you choose to send a written notice of revocation or to mail a new proxy card, you
must submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy to CUB's corporate secretary at 15821 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 100,
Encino, California 91436. Any proxy that you submitted may also be revoked by submitting a new proxy via the Internet or by
telephone no later than Wednesday, August 23, 2017 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, or by voting in person at the special meeting.

If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee and you have instructed your nominee how to vote
your CUB common shares, you must submit new voting instructions to your nominee. You should follow the instructions you
receive from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to change or revoke your vote.

Q: DO I NEED IDENTIFICATION TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING IN PERSON? 

A: Yes. If you hold your CUB common shares in your name as a shareholder of record and you wish to attend the special meeting and
vote in person, please bring valid picture identification.

If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may only vote in person at the special
meeting if you have proof of ownership of your CUB common shares as of the record date and obtain a valid legal proxy from
your broker, bank or other nominee that is the shareholder of record of such shares and present such items at the special meeting.
You must also bring valid picture identification.

Q: ARE CUB SHAREHOLDERS ENTITLED TO DISSENTERS' RIGHTS? 

A: Under the California General Corporation Law, referred to as the CGCL, CUB common shareholders may be entitled to dissenters'
rights in connection with the merger. If you do not wish to accept the merger consideration and you vote "AGAINST" the merger
in person or by proxy at the special meeting, you have the right to seek from CUB the "fair market value" of your shares in lieu of
the mix of cash and PacWest common stock you would receive if the merger is completed. CUB refers you to the section entitled
"The Merger—Dissenters' Rights" and to the applicable provisions of the CGCL attached as Appendix C for information on how
to exercise your dissenters' rights. Failure to follow all of the steps required under the CGCL will result in the loss of your
dissenters' rights. 

Q: WHAT ARE THE MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO U.S.
HOLDERS OF CUB COMMON SHARES? 

A: The merger is intended to qualify, and the obligation of PacWest and CUB to complete the merger is conditioned upon the receipt
of legal opinions from their respective counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. You generally will recognize gain (but not loss) upon receipt of the merger
consideration in exchange for CUB common shares pursuant to the merger in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of
gain realized (i.e., the excess of the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of the PacWest common stock received
pursuant to the merger over your adjusted tax basis in the CUB common shares surrendered in the exchange) and (2) the amount of
cash received pursuant to the merger (excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of PacWest common stock).

Table of Contents

For a more detailed discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction, please see the section
entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger."

The tax consequences of the merger to any particular shareholder will depend on that shareholder's particular facts and
circumstances. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor to determine your tax consequences from the merger.

Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED? 

A: If the merger is not completed, CUB common shareholders will not receive any consideration for their CUB common shares that
otherwise would have been received in connection with the merger. Instead, CUB will remain an independent public company and
its common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ. 

Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF I SELL MY CUB COMMON SHARES AFTER THE RECORD DATE BUT BEFORE THE
SPECIAL MEETING? 

A: The record date of the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date that the merger is expected to be
completed. If you sell or otherwise transfer your CUB common shares after the record date but before the date of the special
meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting (provided that such shares remain outstanding on the date of the
special meeting), but you will not have the right to receive the merger consideration to be received by CUB shareholders in the
merger. In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your CUB common shares through completion of the merger. 

Q: WILL I BE ABLE TO SELL THE SHARES OF PACWEST COMMON STOCK THAT I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER? 

A: Yes. You may freely trade the shares of PacWest common stock issued in the merger. 

Q: ARE THERE RISKS INVOLVED IN UNDERTAKING THE MERGER? 

A: Yes. In evaluating the merger, CUB shareholders should carefully consider the factors discussed in "Risk Factors" beginning on
page 28 and other information about CUB and PacWest included in the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. 

Q: SHOULD CUB SHAREHOLDERS SEND IN THEIR STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW? 

A: No. CUB shareholders SHOULD NOT send in any stock certificates now. If the merger is approved, transmittal materials with
instructions for their completion will be provided to CUB shareholders under separate cover and the stock certificates should be
sent at that time. 

Q: WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE SET OF VOTING MATERIALS? 

A: CUB common shareholders may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this document and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. If you are a shareholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one
name, you will receive more than one proxy card. If you hold CUB common shares in more than one brokerage account, you may
receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold such shares. In each case, please complete,
sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive or otherwise follow the voting instructions set
forth in this document to ensure that you vote every CUB common share that you own.

SUMMARY 

        This summary highlights selected information included in this document and does not contain all of the information that may
be important to you. You should read this entire document and its appendices and the other documents to which the parties refer
before you decide how to vote with respect to the proposals. In addition, the parties incorporate by reference important business and
financial information about CUB and PacWest into this document. For a description of this information, please see the section
entitled "Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference." You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this
document without charge by following the instructions in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" in the
forepart of this document. Each item in this summary includes a page reference directing you to a more complete description of that
item.

The Merger and the Merger Agreement (pages 44 and 80)

        The terms and conditions of the merger are contained in the merger agreement, which is attached to this document as
Appendix A. The parties encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully, as it is the legal document that governs the merger.

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, CUB will merge with and into PacWest, with PacWest being the surviving
corporation.

Merger Consideration (page 44)

        In the merger, each CUB common share owned by a CUB shareholder, other than excluded shares and dissenting shares, will
be converted into the right to receive (i) the cash consideration, and (ii) a number of shares of PacWest common stock equal to the
exchange ratio, subject to adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement and as further described in the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement." For each fractional share that would otherwise be issued, PacWest
will pay cash in an amount equal to the fraction of a share of PacWest common stock which the holder would otherwise be entitled
to receive multiplied by the volume-weighted average price of PacWest common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ over the
determination period. No interest will be paid or accrue on cash payable to holders in lieu of fractional shares.

Recommendation of the CUB Board of Directors (page 51)

        After careful consideration, the CUB board of directors unanimously recommends that CUB shareholders vote "FOR" the
merger proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

        For a more complete description of CUB's reasons for the merger and the recommendations of the CUB board of directors,
please see the section entitled "The Merger—Recommendation of the CUB Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger."

Opinion of CUB's Financial Advisor (page 53)

        On April 5, 2017, the CUB board of directors received an opinion from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., referred to as KBW, its
financial advisor, to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered,
and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration in the
proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of CUB common shares. Subsequent changes in the
operations and prospects of CUB or PacWest, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the
control of CUB or PacWest, and on which KBW's opinion was based, may significantly alter the value of CUB or PacWest or the
prices of PacWest common stock or CUB common shares by the time the merger is completed. Because CUB does not anticipate
asking KBW to update its opinion, the opinion will not address the fairness of the merger consideration from

a financial point of view at the time the merger is completed or as of any other date other than the date of such opinion.

        The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion,
which is attached as Appendix D to this document and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in
preparing the opinion.

        KBW's opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to,
the CUB board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger.
The opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the merger
consideration in the merger to the holders of CUB common shares. It did not address, among other things as set forth in
KBW's opinion, the underlying business decision of CUB to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement or
constitute a recommendation to the CUB board of directors in connection with the merger, and it does not constitute a
recommendation to any holder of CUB common shares or any shareholder of any other entity as to how to vote in
connection with the merger or any other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation regarding whether or not any such
shareholder should enter into a voting, shareholders' or affiliates' agreement with respect to the merger or exercise any
dissenters' or appraisal rights that may be available to such shareholder.

        For a description of the opinion that CUB received from its financial advisor, please refer to the section entitled "The Merger—
Opinion of CUB's Financial Advisor."

CUB Special Meeting (page 35)

        The special meeting will be held at 8:30 a.m., local time, on August 24, 2017, at City Club Los Angeles—Santa Monica Room,
555 South Flower Street, 51st Floor, Los Angeles, California 90071. At the special meeting, holders of CUB common shares will be
asked to approve the merger proposal and the adjournment proposal.

        The CUB board of directors has fixed the close of business on June 30, 2017 as the record date for determining the holders of
CUB common shares entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date,
there were 17,831,131 CUB common shares outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting held by 594 shareholders of
record. Each CUB common share entitles the holder to one vote on each proposal to be considered at the special meeting.

        As of the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of CUB and their affiliates owned and were
entitled to vote 1,473,883 CUB common shares, representing approximately 8.27% of the CUB common shares outstanding on that
date. As of the close of business on the record date, PacWest beneficially held no CUB common shares.

        In connection with the merger agreement, each of the directors of CUB, in his or her capacity as a shareholder of CUB, has
entered into a voting agreement with PacWest in which such director has agreed to vote all CUB common shares that he or she
owns and has the power to vote in favor of the merger proposal and any other matter that is required to be approved by the
shareholders of CUB to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The directors also agreed to vote against
any proposal made in opposition to the approval of the principal terms of the merger agreement or in competition with the merger
agreement and against any acquisition proposal. As of the close of business on the record date, CUB's directors beneficially owned,
in the aggregate, 1,095,309 CUB common shares, allowing them to exercise approximately 6.14% of the voting power of CUB
common shares (which does not include shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options or

upon the vesting of CUB RSUs that were not outstanding as of the close of business on the record date).

        Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such
proposal. Approval of the adjournment proposal requires a vote that satisfies two criteria: (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present, and (ii) the shares voting affirmatively must also
constitute at least a majority of the required quorum.

Interests of CUB Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 68)

        In considering the recommendation of the CUB board of directors with respect to the merger, CUB shareholders should be
aware that certain directors and executive officers of CUB have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
the interests of CUB shareholders generally. The CUB board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among
other matters, in approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and in making its recommendation that
CUB shareholders vote to approve the CUB merger proposal. These interests include:

• CUB executive officers have equity awards that, under the merger agreement, will accelerate and become vested
upon completion of the merger and will be settled for the merger consideration; 

• CUB non-employee directors have CUB restricted shares that, depending on the closing date of the merger, may
accelerate and become vested upon completion of the merger; 

• David I. Rainer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CUB, K. Brian Horton, President and a director of CUB,
and Karen A. Schoenbaum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CUB, have entered into
consulting agreements with PacWest that become effective as of, and are conditioned upon, the closing of the
merger; 

• CUB executive officers are participants in plans and party to agreements that provide for severance payments and
other benefits following a change in control of CUB or upon termination of employment within 24 months following
a change in control of CUB; and 

• CUB directors and officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger
agreement.

        For a more complete description of the interests of CUB's directors and executive officers in the merger, see "The Merger—
Interests of CUB Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

Treatment of CUB Stock Options (page 44)

        At the effective time, each outstanding CUB stock option, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and will entitle the
holder thereof to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of CUB common shares subject to such
option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) an amount equal to (1) $12.00 in cash plus (2) the product of the PacWest average closing
price and 0.5308 over (B) the exercise price per CUB common share underlying such option, less any applicable taxes required to
be withheld with respect to such payment.

Treatment of CUB Restricted Shares and CUB RSUs (page 45)

        At the effective time, any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding CUB restricted share and CUB RSU will
automatically accelerate in full and such CUB restricted shares and CUB RSUs will be converted into, and become exchanged for,
the merger consideration, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting.

• engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions
with any person relating to an acquisition proposal or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement
an acquisition proposal.

        However, the above restriction would not prevent CUB or its board of directors from:

• complying with Rule 14d-9 and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act; 

• at any time before, but not after the CUB shareholder approval is obtained, providing information in response to a
request therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal if CUB receives

good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to violate
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Further, the merger agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, the CUB board of directors and each committee
thereof will not:

• except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose
or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to PacWest, the recommendation of its
board of directors that its shareholders approve the principal terms of the merger agreement; or 

• cause or permit CUB to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
above) relating to any acquisition proposal.

        For more information, please see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Acquisition Proposals."

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 96)

        The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned:

of directors of either party, in the event that both parties mutually consent in writing to terminate the merger
agreement; 

• at any time prior to the effective time, whether before or after the CUB shareholder approval, by action of the board
of directors of either party, in the event that the merger is not consummated by February 28, 2018 (which may be
extended to April 30, 2018 by either party if all conditions to closing have been met except for the receipt of the
required regulatory approvals), which date is referred to as the end date, except to the extent that the failure of the
merger to be consummated results from the knowing action or inaction of the party seeking to terminate, which
action or inaction is in violation of its obligations under the merger agreement; 

• at any time prior to the effective time, whether before or after the CUB shareholder approval, by action of the board
of directors of either party if: 

• the approval of any governmental authority required for consummation of the merger, the bank merger or the

of such governmental authority, or an application therefor has been permanently withdrawn by mutual
agreement of the parties at the request or suggestion of a governmental authority, or 

• the CUB shareholder approval is not obtained at the duly convened special meeting; 

• at any time prior to the effective time, whether before or after the CUB shareholder approval, by action of either
party's board of directors if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by
the other party, such that if continuing on the closing date of the merger, the condition as to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties or the compliance with covenants by the other party would not be satisfied and such
breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within 30 calendar days after written notice thereof is
given by the terminating party (or such shorter period as remaining prior to the end date); provided, that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement;

• CUB has breached in any material respect the prohibitions in the merger agreement relating to acquisition
proposals;

• at any time after the end of 10 business days following receipt of an acquisition proposal, the CUB board of
directors has failed to reaffirm its recommendation that the CUB shareholders approve the principal terms of
the merger agreement as promptly as practicable (but in any event within five business days) after receipt of
any written request to do so by PacWest; or 

• a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding CUB common shares has been publicly disclosed (other than
by PacWest or an affiliate of PacWest) and the CUB board of directors recommends that CUB shareholders
tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or, within 10 business days after the commencement of
such tender or exchange offer, the CUB board of directors fails to recommend unequivocally against
acceptance of such offer; or 

• by action of CUB's board of directors, by written notice to PacWest on the business day immediately following the
determination date, effective as of three business days following the date of such written notice, in the event that: 

• the PacWest average closing price is less than $44.84 per share (with a proportionate adjustment for any
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the date of the merger agreement and the determination date); and 

• the quotient of the PacWest average closing price divided by $52.75 is less than (i) the quotient of the
average price of the KBW Index during the determination period divided by the index ratio, minus (ii) 0.15.

If CUB elects to terminate the merger agreement and provides written notice thereof to PacWest, then within two
business days following PacWest's receipt of such notice, PacWest may elect to reinstate the merger and related
transactions, and adjust the exchange ratio to equal the lesser of (i) the quotient of $23.80 divided by the PacWest
average closing price and (ii) (a) the quotient of $23.80 divided by the PacWest average closing price (b) multiplied
by the index ratio. Alternatively, PacWest may elect not to adjust the exchange ratio, and, in lieu thereof, may
increase the cash consideration per CUB common share such that the value of the total consideration received for
each share is the same as if the exchange ratio had been adjusted as described above.

shareholder approval has not been obtained or (B) the CUB shareholder approval was not obtained at the special
meeting, and (iii) within 12 months after the termination of the merger agreement, CUB enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to or consummates an acquisition proposal (except that for purposes of the foregoing,

Voting Agreements (page 98)

        Each of the directors of CUB, in his or her capacity as a shareholder of CUB, has entered into a voting agreement with
PacWest in which such director has agreed to vote all CUB common shares that he or she owns and has the power to vote in favor
of the merger proposal and any other matter that is required to be approved by the shareholders of CUB to facilitate the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. The directors also agreed to vote against any proposal made in opposition to the approval of
the principal terms of the merger agreement or in competition with the merger agreement and against any acquisition proposal. As
of the close of business on the record date, CUB's directors beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 1,095,309 CUB common shares,
allowing them to exercise approximately 6.14% of the voting power of CUB common shares (which does not include shares
issuable upon the exercise of stock options or upon the vesting of CUB RSUs that were not outstanding as of the close of business
on the record date).

        The voting agreements terminate in certain circumstances, including in the event that the merger agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

        For more information, please see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Voting Agreements."

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 101)

        The merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. A
CUB shareholder who receives PacWest common stock and cash (other than cash received in lieu of a fractional share of PacWest
common stock) in exchange for CUB common shares pursuant to the merger, will generally recognize gain (but not loss) in an
amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of gain realized (i.e., the excess of the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market
value of the PacWest common stock received pursuant to the merger over such holder's adjusted tax basis in the CUB common
shares surrendered in the exchange) and (2) the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger (excluding any cash received in lieu
of a fractional share of PacWest common stock). It is a condition to the completion of the merger that PacWest and CUB receive
written opinions from their respective counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

        Tax matters are complicated and the tax consequences of the merger to each CUB shareholder may depend on such
shareholder's particular facts and circumstances. CUB shareholders are urged to

Litigation Related to the Merger (page 100)

        Two putative shareholder class action lawsuits, referred to collectively as the merger litigation, have been filed in connection
with the merger agreement. The first action, Parshall v. CU Bancorp et al., referred to as the Parshall complaint, Case No. 2:17-cv-
04303, was filed on June 9, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The Parshall complaint
alleges that the members of the CUB board of directors violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, referred to as
the Exchange Act, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, based upon alleged omissions and misrepresentations in the S-4
registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 26, 2017, referred to as the initial
registration statement, by approving the proposed merger for inadequate consideration and by entering into the merger agreement
containing preclusive deal protection devices. The plaintiff in this action seeks injunctive relief prohibiting consummation of the
merger, rescission and damages in the event the merger is consummated, an accounting of damages suffered by the plaintiff and the
putative class, attorneys' fees and costs and other and further relief.

        The second action, Klein v. CU Bancorp et al., referred to as the Klein complaint, Case No. 2:17-cv-04353, was filed on
June 12, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The Klein complaint alleges that the
members of the CUB board of directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, based upon alleged omissions and
misrepresentations in the initial registration statement, by approving the proposed merger for inadequate consideration and by
entering into the merger agreement containing preclusive deal protection devices. The plaintiff in this action seeks injunctive relief
prohibiting consummation of the merger, rescission and damages in the event the merger is consummated, an accounting of
damages suffered by the plaintiff and the putative class, attorneys' fees and costs and other and further relief.

        At this stage, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the proceedings in the merger litigation or their impact on CUB,
PacWest or the merger.

Comparison of Shareholders' Rights (page 104)

        The rights of CUB shareholders who continue as PacWest stockholders after the merger will be governed by the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of PacWest rather than by the articles of incorporation and bylaws of CUB. For more information, please
see the section entitled "Comparison of Shareholders' Rights."

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA 

        The following table shows per common share data regarding basic and diluted earnings, cash dividends and book value for
(a) PacWest and CUB on a historical basis, (b) PacWest and CUB on a pro forma combined basis and (c) CUB on a pro forma
equivalent basis. The pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share information was computed as if the merger had been completed
on January 1, 2016. The pro forma book value per share information was computed as if the merger had been completed on
December 31, 2016 or March 31, 2017, as applicable.

        The following pro forma information has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with PacWest's and CUB's
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 and their unaudited consolidated financial statements as of
and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017, incorporated herein by reference. This information is presented for
illustrative purposes only. You should not rely on the pro forma combined or pro forma equivalent amounts as they are not
necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger had been completed as of
the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined company.
The pro forma information, although helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of
assumptions, does not reflect the benefits of expected cost savings, opportunities to earn additional revenue, the impact of
restructuring and merger-related costs, or other factors that may result as a consequence of the merger and, accordingly, does not
attempt to predict or suggest future results.

RISK FACTORS 

        In addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this document, including the matters addressed
under the caption entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," CUB shareholders should carefully consider
the following factors in deciding whether to vote for CUB's proposals. Please see the sections entitled "Where You Can Find More
Information" and "Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference."

Because the market price of PacWest common stock will fluctuate, the value of the merger consideration to be received by CUB
shareholders may change.

        Upon completion of the merger, other than in certain circumstances described below, each CUB common share (other than excluded
shares and dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration consisting of $12.00 in cash plus 0.5308
of a share of PacWest common stock. Accordingly, the value of the merger consideration to be received by CUB shareholders will be
based on the value of PacWest common stock at closing. The value of the PacWest common stock to be received by CUB shareholders in
the merger may vary from the value as of the date the merger was announced, the date that this document was mailed to CUB
shareholders, the date of the special meeting and the determination period. Any change in the market price of PacWest common stock prior
to completion of the merger will affect the value of the merger consideration that CUB shareholders will receive upon completion of the
merger. Accordingly, at the time of the special meeting, CUB shareholders will not know or be able to calculate the value of the per share
consideration they would receive upon completion of the merger. Share price changes may result from a variety of factors, including
general market and economic conditions, changes in PacWest's or CUB's businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory
considerations, among other things. Many of these factors are beyond the control of PacWest and CUB. CUB shareholders should obtain
current market quotations for CUB common shares and PacWest common stock before voting their shares at the special meeting.

        In addition, the merger agreement provides that CUB may terminate the merger agreement if (i) the PacWest average closing price
falls below $44.84 per share and (ii) the PacWest average closing price underperforms the average KBW Index for the determination
period by more than 15%. If CUB elects to terminate the merger agreement, then PacWest may reinstate the agreement after increasing the
exchange ratio or cash consideration according to formulas set forth in the merger agreement such that the value of the merger
consideration is intended to fix at $35.80 per share, as adjusted for any decline in the KBW Index. Accordingly, at the time of the CUB
special meeting, CUB shareholders may not know or be able to calculate the applicable metrics over the determination period to determine
the cash consideration or the exchange ratio used to determine the number of shares of PacWest common stock they would receive with
respect to each CUB common share upon completion of the merger, and the number of shares of PacWest common stock or cash
consideration to be received by CUB shareholders may be materially less than anticipated by CUB shareholders.

        For a more detailed discussion of potential adjustments to the merger consideration, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement
—Termination of the Merger Agreement."

CUB shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in PacWest after the merger and will exercise less influence over
PacWest's management.

        CUB shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the CUB board of directors and on other matters affecting CUB.
Upon the completion of the merger, except for shareholders who own common shares in both PacWest and CUB, each CUB shareholder
will be a shareholder of PacWest with a percentage ownership of PacWest that is smaller than such shareholder's current percentage
ownership of CUB. It is currently expected that former shareholders of CUB as a group will

Table of Contents

receive shares in the merger constituting approximately 7.3% of the outstanding shares of PacWest's common stock immediately after the
merger. Because of this, CUB shareholders will have less influence on the management and policies of PacWest than they now have on the
management and policies of CUB.

Sales of substantial amounts of PacWest's common stock in the open market by former CUB shareholders could depress PacWest's
stock price.

        Shares of PacWest common stock that are issued to CUB shareholders in the merger will be freely tradable without restrictions or
further registration under the Securities Act. As of the close of business on June 30, 2017, PacWest had approximately 121,448,321 shares
of common stock outstanding. Based on the CUB common shares currently outstanding, PacWest currently expects to issue approximately
9,487,221 shares of its common stock in connection with the merger.

        Because of the significantly enhanced liquidity of PacWest common stock as compared to CUB common shares on account of the
greater public float and trading volume of PacWest common stock relative to CUB common shares, if the merger is completed, CUB's
former shareholders may sell substantial amounts of PacWest common stock in the public market following completion of the merger. Any
such sales may cause the market price of PacWest common stock to decrease. These sales might also make it more difficult for PacWest to
sell equity or equity-related securities at a time and price that it otherwise would deem appropriate.

PacWest may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.

        The success of the merger will depend on, among other things, PacWest's ability to combine and integrate the business of CUB into
PacWest's business. If PacWest is not able to successfully achieve this objective, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized
fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.

        PacWest and CUB have operated and, until the consummation of the merger, will continue to operate independently. It is possible that
the integration process or other factors could result in the loss or departure of key employees, the disruption of the ongoing business of
PacWest or CUB or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. It is also possible that clients, customers, depositors
and counterparties of CUB could choose to discontinue their relationships with PacWest post-merger because they prefer doing business
with a different financial institution, which would adversely affect the future anticipated performance of PacWest. These transition matters
could have an adverse effect on CUB during the pre-merger period and the combined company for an undetermined amount of time after
the consummation of the merger.

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated
or cannot be met.

        Before the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger and the bank merger, may be completed, various
approvals must be obtained from bank regulatory authorities. These governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of such
approvals. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of
the merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on PacWest following the merger. The regulatory approvals may not be received
at all, may not be received in a timely fashion, and may contain conditions on the completion of the merger that are not anticipated or
cannot be met. If the consummation of the merger is delayed, including by a delay in receipt of necessary governmental approvals, the
business, financial condition and results of operations of each company may also be materially adversely affected.

Table of Contents

Failure of the merger to be completed, the termination of the merger agreement or a significant delay in the consummation of the
merger could negatively impact PacWest and CUB.

        The merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions
include: (i) approval of the principal terms of the merger agreement by CUB shareholders, (ii) absence of any governmental order or law
prohibiting completion of the merger, and (iii) effectiveness of the registration statement of which this document is a part.

        The obligation of each party to consummate the merger is also conditioned upon (i) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the
merger agreement, (iii) receipt by such party of a tax opinion to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and (iv) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to the other party
since the date of the merger agreement. The obligation of PacWest to consummate the merger is also conditioned upon (i) the adjusted
shareholders' equity and allowance for loan losses of CUB being outside of specified levels, (ii) the receipt of certain required regulatory
approvals and such approvals not containing materially burdensome regulatory conditions, (iii) the repurchase by CUB of all outstanding
shares of CUB's Series A preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury Department and (iv) holders of not more than 10% of outstanding CUB
common shares having duly exercised their dissenters' rights under Chapter 13 of the CGCL. The obligation of CUB to consummate the
merger is also conditioned upon the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals.

        These conditions to the consummation of the merger may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed. In
addition, if the merger is not completed by the end date, either PacWest or CUB may choose not to proceed with the merger, and the
parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time, before or after the CUB shareholder approval.

        Furthermore, prior to the CUB shareholder approval, PacWest may terminate the merger agreement and require payment of a
$26.5 million termination fee if CUB materially breaches the restriction against soliciting alternative acquisition proposals, if CUB's board
of directors recommends against the merger, if CUB's board of directors fails to reaffirm its recommendation in response to an alternative
acquisition proposal after receiving a written request to do so from PacWest, or if CUB's board of directors recommends that CUB
shareholders tender (or fails to recommend against tendering) their shares in a competing tender offer. CUB must also pay the
$26.5 million termination fee if an alternative acquisition proposal has been made or announced, the merger agreement is terminated
because the merger was not consummated by the end date and/or the CUB shareholder approval has not been obtained, and within
12 months after the termination of the merger agreement, CUB enters into a definitive agreement with respect to or consummates a
proposal by a third party to acquire 50% or more of the assets or voting power of CUB.

        If the merger is not consummated, the ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations of each party may be materially
adversely affected and the market price of each party's common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the current
market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be consummated. If the consummation of the merger is delayed, including
by the receipt of a competing acquisition proposal, the business, financial condition and results of operations of each company may be
materially adversely affected.

        In addition, each party has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, the parties would have to recognize these expenses,
including, in the case of CUB under certain circumstances, a termination fee, without realizing the expected benefits of the transaction.
Any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with the failure of or delay in consummating the merger, including the diversion
of management attention from pursuing other

9/8/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543643/000104746917004755/a2232770zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

opportunities and the constraints in the merger agreement on each party's ongoing business during the pendency of the merger, could have
a material adverse effect on each party's business, financial condition and results of operations.

        Additionally, PacWest's or CUB's business may be adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to
the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger, and the market price of
PacWest common stock or CUB common shares might change to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that
the merger will be completed. If the merger agreement is terminated and a party's board of directors seeks another merger or business
combination, such party's shareholders cannot be certain that such party will be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction on
more attractive terms than the merger.

CUB will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.

        Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, customers, suppliers and vendors may have an adverse effect on the
business, financial condition and results of operations of CUB and, consequently, PacWest. It is currently contemplated that certain CU
Bank branches are to be closed or consolidated into nearby Pacific Western Bank branches and certain Pacific Western Bank branches are
planned to be closed or consolidated into nearby CU Bank branches. These uncertainties and contemplated changes may impair CUB's
ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and customers pending the consummation of the merger, as such personnel and
customers may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the consummation of the merger. Additionally, these uncertainties
and contemplated changes could cause customers, suppliers, vendors and others who deal with CUB to seek to change existing business
relationships with CUB or fail to extend an existing relationship with CUB. In addition, competitors may target CUB's existing customers
by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the merger.

        CUB has a small number of key personnel. The pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration may place a burden on
CUB's management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and
any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on CUB's business, financial
condition and results of operations.

        In addition, the merger agreement restricts CUB from taking certain actions without PacWest's consent while the merger is pending.
These restrictions may, among other matters, and subject to certain exceptions, prevent CUB from pursuing otherwise attractive business
opportunities, selling assets, incurring indebtedness, engaging in significant capital expenditures, entering into other transactions or
making other changes to CUB's business prior to consummation of the merger or termination of the merger agreement. These restrictions
could have a material adverse effect on CUB's business, financial condition and results of operations. Please see the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Prior to the Completion of the Merger" for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable
to CUB.

CUB directors and officers have interests in the merger different from the interests of other CUB shareholders.

        CUB's executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of CUB
shareholders generally. Such interests include the following: (1) CUB executive officers have unvested equity awards that will be
accelerated and vest in full on the completion of the merger; (2) CUB executive officers are participants in plans and party to agreements
that provide for severance payments and other benefits in the event of, or upon a termination of employment within 24 months following,
a change in control of CUB; (3) CUB directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage
following the closing of the

merger; (4) David I. Rainer, CUB's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, K. Brian Horton, director and President of CUB and Karen
Schoenbaum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CUB, have entered into consulting agreements with PacWest that
become effective as of, and are conditioned upon, the closing of the merger; and (5) CUB non-employee directors have CUB restricted
shares that, depending on the closing date of the merger, may accelerate and become vested upon completion of the merger. These interests
are described in more detail under the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of CUB Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

Shares of PacWest common stock to be received by CUB shareholders as a result of the merger will have rights different from CUB
common shares.

        Upon completion of the merger, the rights of former CUB shareholders will be governed by the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of PacWest. The rights associated with CUB common shares are different from the rights associated with PacWest common stock.
In addition, the rights of stockholders under Delaware law, where PacWest is incorporated, may differ from the rights of shareholders
under California law, where CUB is incorporated. Please see the section entitled "Comparison of Shareholders' Rights" for a discussion of
the different rights associated with PacWest common stock.

The merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire CUB.

        The merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a business combination proposal to
CUB that might result in greater value to CUB shareholders than the merger. These provisions include a general prohibition on CUB from
soliciting, or, subject to certain exceptions, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for
competing transactions. In addition, in some circumstances upon termination of the merger agreement, CUB may be required to pay
PacWest a $26.5 million termination fee. However, the failure of CUB shareholders to approve the merger agreement will not in and of
itself trigger CUB's obligation to pay a termination fee, unless other factors also exist, including a third-party proposal to acquire CUB and
entry into a definitive agreement with respect to an acquisition of CUB, or consummation of an acquisition of CUB, in each case within
12 months following termination.

        Each of the directors of CUB, in his or her capacity as a shareholder of CUB, has entered into a voting agreement with PacWest in
which such director has agreed to vote all CUB common shares that he or she owns and has the power to vote in favor of the merger
proposal and any other matter that is required to be approved by the shareholders of CUB to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. The directors also agreed to vote against any proposal made in opposition to the approval of the principal terms of the
merger agreement or in competition with the merger agreement and against any acquisition proposal. As of the close of business on the
record date, CUB's directors beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 1,095,309 CUB common shares, allowing them to exercise
approximately 6.14% of the voting power of CUB common shares (which does not include shares issuable upon the exercise of stock
options or upon the vesting of CUB RSUs that were not outstanding as of the close of business on the record date). For more information,
please see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Voting Agreements." CUB also has an unqualified obligation to submit the
merger proposal to a vote of CUB shareholders, even if CUB receives a proposal that its board of directors believes is superior to the
merger.

In connection with the announcement of the merger agreement, two shareholder class action lawsuits are pending, seeking, among
other things, to enjoin the merger, and an adverse judgment in one or both of these lawsuits may prevent the merger from becoming
effective in the fourth quarter of 2017, if at all.

        Two putative shareholder class action lawsuits have been filed in connection with the merger agreement. The Parshall complaint was
filed on June 9, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The Parshall complaint alleges that the
members of the CUB board of

directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, based upon alleged omissions and misrepresentations in the initial
registration statement, by approving the proposed merger for inadequate consideration and by entering into the merger agreement
containing preclusive deal protection devices. The plaintiff in this action seeks injunctive relief prohibiting consummation of the merger,
rescission and damages in the event the merger is consummated, an accounting of damages suffered by the plaintiff and the putative class,
attorneys' fees and costs and other and further relief.

        The Klein complaint was filed on June 12, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The Klein
complaint alleges that the members of the CUB board of directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, based upon
alleged omissions and misrepresentations in the initial registration statement, by approving the proposed merger for inadequate
consideration and by entering into the merger agreement containing preclusive deal protection devices. The plaintiff in this action seeks
injunctive relief prohibiting consummation of the merger, rescission and damages in the event the merger is consummated, an accounting
of damages suffered by the plaintiff and the putative class, attorneys' fees and costs and other and further relief.

        At this stage, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the proceedings in the merger litigation or their impact on CUB, PacWest or
the merger. If the plaintiffs are successful in enjoining the consummation of the merger, the lawsuits may prevent the merger from
becoming effective in the fourth quarter of 2017, if at all.

PacWest expects to incur substantial expenses related to the merger.

        PacWest expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with consummation of the merger and integrating the business,
operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures of CUB into that of PacWest. Although PacWest and CUB have
assumed that a certain level of transaction and combination expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond their control
that could affect the total amount or the timing of their combination expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature,
are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. As a result of these expenses, both PacWest and CUB expect to take charges against
their earnings before and after the completion of the merger. The charges taken in connection with the merger are expected to be
significant, although the aggregate amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.

The opinion of CUB's financial advisor will not reflect changes in circumstances between the date of the opinion and the completion
of the merger.

        On April 5, 2017, the CUB board of directors received an opinion from KBW, its financial advisor, to the effect that, as of such date
and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken
by KBW as set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of CUB common shares. Subsequent changes in the operations and prospects of CUB or PacWest, general market and economic
conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of CUB or PacWest, and on which KBW's opinion was based, may
significantly alter the value of CUB or PacWest or the prices of PacWest common stock or CUB common shares by the time the merger is
completed. Because CUB does not anticipate asking KBW to update its opinion, the opinion will not address the fairness of the merger
consideration from a financial point of view at the time the merger is completed or as of any other date other than the date of such opinion.
For a description of the opinion that CUB received from its financial advisor, please refer to the section entitled "The Merger—Opinion of
CUB's Financial Advisor."

• the possibility that a change in the interest rate environment may reduce net interest margins; 

• higher than anticipated operating expenses; 

• the effectiveness of PacWest's risk management framework; 

• asset/liability re-pricing risks and liquidity risks; 

• the costs and effects of legal, compliance, and regulatory actions, changes and developments, including the impact of
adverse judgments or settlements in litigation;

CUB SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 

Date, Time and Place 

        The special meeting will be held at City Club Los Angeles—Santa Monica Room, 555 South Flower Street, 51st Floor, Los Angeles,
California 90071, on August 24, 2017, at 8:30 a.m., local time. On or about July 26, 2017, CUB commenced mailing of this proxy
statement/prospectus and the enclosed form of proxy to its shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        At the special meeting, CUB common shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the following proposals:

• Merger Proposal.  To approve the principal terms of the merger agreement, dated as of April 5, 2017, by and between
PacWest and CUB, as such agreement may be amended from time to time, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to
this proxy statement/prospectus; and 

• Adjournment Proposal.  To approve one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
including adjournments to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to approve the merger proposal.

        CUB will transact no other business at the special meeting other than as listed above.

Recommendation of the CUB Board of Directors 

        After careful consideration, the CUB board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best
interests of CUB and its shareholders.

        The CUB board of directors recommends that you vote "FOR" the merger proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.
Please see the section entitled "The Merger—Recommendation of the CUB Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger."

Record Date and Quorum 

        The CUB board of directors has fixed the close of business on June 30, 2017 as the record date for determining the holders of CUB
common shares entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting.

        As of the close of business on the record date, there were 17,831,131 CUB common shares outstanding and entitled to vote at the
special meeting held by 594 shareholders of record. Each CUB common share entitles the holder to one vote on each proposal to be
considered at the special meeting.

        A majority of shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for transacting business at the special
meeting. Abstentions will be counted as represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a
quorum for all matters voted on at the special meeting.

        Since none of the proposals to be voted on at the CUB special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary
authority to vote, there can be no broker non-votes at the special meeting. Consequently, failure to provide instructions to your bank,
broker or other nominee on how to vote will result in your shares not being counted as represented for purposes of establishing a quorum
at the CUB special meeting. Please see "—Shares Held in 'Street Name"' below for further information.

Table of Contents

        As of the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of CUB and their affiliates owned and were entitled to
vote 1,473,883 CUB common shares, representing approximately 8.27% of the CUB common shares outstanding on that date. As of the
close of business on the record date, PacWest beneficially held no CUB common shares.

        In connection with the merger agreement, each of the directors of CUB, in his or her capacity as a shareholder of CUB, has entered
into a voting agreement with PacWest in which such director has agreed to vote all CUB common shares that he or she owns and has the
power to vote in favor of the merger proposal and any other matter that is required to be approved by the shareholders of CUB to facilitate
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The directors also agreed to vote against any proposal made in opposition to the
approval of the principal terms of the merger agreement or in competition with the merger agreement and against any acquisition proposal.
As of the close of business on the record date, CUB's directors beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 1,095,309 CUB common shares,
allowing them to exercise approximately 6.14% of the voting power of CUB common shares (which does not include shares issuable upon
the exercise of stock options or upon the vesting of CUB RSUs that were not outstanding as of the close of business on the record date).

Required Vote 

• Merger Proposal:  The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the proposal is required
to approve the merger proposal. 

• Adjournment Proposal:  The adjournment proposal requires a vote that satisfies two criteria: (i) the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present, and (ii) the shares voting
affirmatively must also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum.

Treatment of Abstentions; Failure to Vote 

        For purposes of the special meeting, an abstention occurs when a CUB common shareholder attends the special meeting, either in
person or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting.

        Abstentions will be counted as represented at the special meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for
all matters voted on at the special meeting.

• For the merger proposal, if a CUB common shareholder present in person at the special meeting abstains from voting, or
responds by proxy with an "abstain" vote, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. If a CUB
common shareholder is not present in person at the special meeting and does not respond by proxy, it will also have the
same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. 

• The adjournment proposal requires a vote that satisfies two criteria: (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present, and (ii) the shares voting affirmatively must
also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum. Accordingly, for purposes of the adjournment proposal,
abstentions will not affect the outcome under clause (i), which recognizes only actual votes cast. However, abstentions will
affect the outcome under clause (ii) if the number of shares voting affirmatively, though a majority of the shares
represented and voting, does not constitute a majority of the required quorum.

Voting on Proxies; Incomplete Proxies 

        Giving a proxy means that a shareholder authorizes the persons named in the proxy to vote such holder's shares at the special meeting
in the manner such holder directs. A CUB common shareholder may vote by proxy or in person at the special meeting.

Table of Contents

        The method of voting by proxy differs for shares held by shareholders of record and shares held in "street name."

Shareholders of Record:

        If your CUB common shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to these
shares. If you hold your shares in your name as a shareholder of record, you may submit your proxy before the special meeting in one of
the following ways:

• By telephone: Use the telephone number shown on your proxy card. Use any touch-tone telephone to vote your proxy
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Have your proxy card handy when you call. You will be prompted to enter your control
number(s), which is located on your proxy card, and then follow the directions given. 

• Through the Internet: Visit the website shown on your proxy card to vote via the Internet. Use the Internet to vote your
proxy 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Have your proxy card handy when you access the website. You will be prompted to
enter your control number(s), which is located on your proxy card, to create and submit an electronic ballot. 

• By mail: Complete, sign, date and return the proxy card in the enclosed envelope. The envelope requires no additional
postage if mailed in the United States.

        You may also cast your vote in person at the special meeting. Please see "—Attending the Special Meeting and Voting in Person"
below for further information.

        CUB requests that CUB common shareholders vote by telephone, over the Internet or by completing, dating and signing the
accompanying proxy and returning it to CUB as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the accompanying proxy is
returned properly executed, the CUB common shares represented by it will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the
instructions contained on the proxy card. Electronic proxies submitted via the Internet or by telephone must be received no later than
Wednesday, August 23, 2017 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time.

        If you hold your CUB common shares in your name as a shareholder of record, and you sign and return your proxy card without
indicating how to vote on any particular proposal, the CUB common shares represented by the proxy will be voted "FOR" the merger
proposal and "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

Shares Held in "Street Name":

        If your CUB common shares are held in an account with a bank, broke or other nominee, which are referred to as shares held in
"street name," the bank, broker or other nominee is considered the shareholder of record with respect to these shares and you are the
beneficial owner of these "street name" shares.

        If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank
or other nominee that you must follow in order to vote your shares. You should refer to the voting form used by that firm to determine
whether you may vote by telephone, Internet or mail.

        If your shares are held in "street name," CUB recommends that you mark, date, sign and promptly mail the voting instruction form
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee in accordance with the instructions provided by such nominee. If you do not give your
bank, broker or other nominees instructions on how to vote your CUB common shares, your bank, broker or other nominees will not be
able to vote your shares on either of the proposals at the special meeting and your shares will not be represented at the special meeting.

37



9/8/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543643/000104746917004755/a2232770zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

        If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee you must either direct your nominee on how to vote
your shares or obtain a proxy from such nominee to vote in person at the CUB special meeting. If your shares are held in "street name,"
you may only vote in person at the CUB special meeting if you have proof of ownership of your CUB common shares as of the record date
and obtain a valid legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee that is the shareholder of record of such shares and present such
items at the CUB special meeting. Please see "—Attending the Special Meeting and Voting in Person" below for further information.

        Every shareholder's vote is important. Accordingly, each CUB common shareholder should promptly submit a proxy,
whether or not the shareholder plans to attend the special meeting.

        If you are a shareholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. If
you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you may receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account
in which you hold shares. In each case, please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction form that you
receive.

Shares Held in "Street Name" 

        If your CUB common shares are held in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must provide the bank, broker or
other nominee, as the shareholder of record of your shares, with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the instructions
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. You may not vote shares held in "street name" by returning a proxy card directly to CUB
or by voting in person at the special meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy," which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other
nominee.

        Brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares in "street name" for the beneficial owner are not allowed to vote with respect to
the approval of matters that are "non-routine" without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. Both proposals to be voted on at the
CUB special meeting are considered "non-routine" matters and, therefore, brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary
voting power on these matters. A "broker non-vote" occurs on an item when (i) a bank, broker or other nominee has discretionary authority
to vote on one or more proposals to be voted on at a meeting of shareholders, but is not permitted to vote on other proposals without
instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the bank, broker or other nominee with
such instructions. Because none of the proposals to be voted on at the CUB special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may
have discretionary authority to vote, there can be no broker non-votes at the CUB special meeting.

        Accordingly, if your CUB common shares are held in "street name," your bank, broker or other nominee will NOT be able to
vote your CUB common shares on either the merger proposal or the adjournment proposal, and your shares will not be counted as
represented for purposes of establishing a quorum at the special meeting unless you have properly instructed your bank, broker or
other nominee on how to vote.

• For the merger proposal, shares not represented at the special meeting are still considered outstanding and, therefore, will
have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. The merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority
of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. Therefore, the failure of a holder of CUB common shares to provide its bank,
broker or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal. 

• The adjournment proposal requires a vote that satisfies two criteria: (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present, and (ii) the shares voting affirmatively must
also constitute at least a majority of the

Table of Contents

required quorum. Your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on the
special meeting proposals without your instructions. Consequently, failure to provide instructions to your bank, broker or
other nominee on how to vote will result in your shares not being represented at the special meeting. Accordingly, for
purposes of the adjournment proposal, your shares will not affect the outcome under clause (i), which recognizes only
actual votes cast. However, your shares will affect the outcome under clause (ii) if the number of shares voting
affirmatively, though a majority of the shares represented and voting, does not constitute a majority of the required quorum.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a Shareholder's Vote 

        If you hold your CUB common shares in your name as a shareholder of record, you may change your vote at any time before your
proxy is voted at the special meeting. You may do this in one of four ways:

• first, by sending a notice of revocation stating that you would like to revoke your proxy; 

• second, by sending a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card; 

• third, by logging onto the Internet website specified on your proxy card in the same manner you would submit your proxy
electronically or by calling the telephone number specified on your proxy card, in each case if you were eligible to do so
and following the instructions on the proxy card; or 

• fourth, by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the CUB special meeting will not in itself
constitute the revocation of a proxy.

        If you are a CUB shareholder of record and you choose to send a written notice of revocation or to mail a new proxy card, you must
submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy to CUB's corporate secretary at 15821 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 100, Encino,
California 91436. Any proxy that you submitted may also be revoked by submitting a new proxy via the Internet or by telephone no later
than Wednesday, August 23, 2017 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, or by voting in person at the special meeting.

        If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee and you have instructed your nominee how to vote
your CUB common shares, you must submit new voting instructions to your nominee. You should follow the instructions you receive from
your bank, broker or other nominee on how to change or revoke your vote.

Attending the Special Meeting and Voting in Person 

        The special meeting will be held at City Club Los Angeles—Santa Monica Room, 555 South Flower Street, 51st Floor, Los Angeles,
California 90071, on August 24, 2017, at 8:30 a.m., local time. Subject to space availability, all CUB common shareholders as of the close
of business on the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the special meeting. Since seating may be limited, admission to
the special meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration and seating will begin at 8:00 a.m., local time.

        If you hold your CUB common shares in your name as a shareholder of record and you wish to attend the special meeting and vote in
person, please bring valid picture identification.

        If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may only vote in person at the CUB special
meeting if you have proof of ownership of your CUB common shares as of the record date and obtain a valid legal proxy from your bank,
broker or other nominee that is the shareholder of record of such shares and present such items at the CUB special meeting. You must also
bring valid picture identification.

Table of Contents

        Any representative of a shareholder who wishes to attend the CUB special meeting must present acceptable documentation
evidencing his or her authority, acceptable evidence of ownership by the holder of CUB common shares and an acceptable form of
identification.

Dissenters' Rights 

        In connection with the merger, CUB common shareholders will have the opportunity to exercise dissenters' rights in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 13 of the California General Corporation Law, or CGCL. A copy of Chapter 13 of the CGCL is attached
to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix C. A dissenting shareholder who votes "AGAINST" the merger in person or by proxy at
the special meeting and who follows the required procedures may receive cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of his or her
CUB common shares in lieu of the merger consideration provided for under the merger agreement. For additional details and information
on how to exercise your dissenters' rights, please refer to "The Merger—Dissenters' Rights" on page 76 and Appendix C of this proxy
statement/prospectus. Failure to follow all of the steps required under the CGCL will result in the loss of your dissenters' rights.

Householding 

        The SEC's proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy proxy statement delivery
requirements for two or more shareholders sharing an address by delivering one proxy statement to those shareholders. This procedure,
known as "householding," reduces the amount of duplicate information that shareholders receive and lowers printing and mailing costs.

        If you share an address with another shareholder, you may receive only one set of proxy materials. If you wish to receive a separate
copy of proxy materials now or in the future, please request the additional copies: (i) by sending a request to CU Bancorp, 15821 Ventura
Boulevard, Suite 100, Encino, California 91436, Attention: Corporate Secretary, (ii) by email to awolman@cunb.com, (iii) by facsimile to
(818) 257-7703 or (iv) by calling CUB Investor Relations at (818) 257-7700. The proxy statement/prospectus is also available on the
internet at http://www.viewproxy.com/cubancorp2017. Similarly, if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials and would
like to receive only one copy for your household, you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee, or you may contact CUB in the
same manner as set forth above.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        CUB is soliciting proxies for the special meeting from CUB common shareholders on behalf of its board of directors. CUB will bear
all of the costs of the proxy solicitation for the special meeting, including the costs of preparing, printing and mailing this proxy
statement/prospectus to its shareholders. In addition to solicitations by mail, CUB's directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies in
person or by telephone, email, facsimile or other electronic methods without additional compensation. CUB has engaged Alliance
Advisors, LLC to assist CUB in the solicitation of proxies and the mailing of the proxy materials for the special meeting, as well as to
provide related advice and informational support. Such firm will be paid a fee of approximately $20,000 plus reimbursement of reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses.

        CUB will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in forwarding proxy materials to the beneficial owners of CUB common shares held in "street name" by such persons.

CUB PROPOSALS 

Merger Proposal 

        As discussed throughout this proxy statement/prospectus, CUB is asking its common shareholders to approve the merger proposal.
Holders of CUB common shares should read carefully this document in its entirety, including the appendices, for more detailed
information concerning the merger agreement and the merger. In particular, holders of CUB common shares are directed to the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement/prospectus.

The CUB board of directors recommends a vote "FOR" the merger proposal.

Adjournment Proposal 

        The special meeting may be adjourned to another time and place, if necessary or appropriate, to permit, among other things, the
further solicitation of proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal.

        If, at the special meeting, we do not have the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote to approve the
merger proposal, CUB intends to move to adjourn the special meeting in order to enable the board of directors to solicit additional proxies
for approval of the merger proposal. If the common shareholders approve the adjournment proposal, CUB could adjourn the special
meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from common shareholders who have
previously voted.

The CUB board of directors recommends a vote "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

No Other Matters 

        Under Section 601(a) of the CGCL, CUB may not transact any other business at the special meeting other than as listed above.

THE MERGER 

        The following is a discussion of the merger and the material terms of the merger agreement between PacWest and CUB. You are
urged to read carefully the merger agreement in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this document and incorporated
by reference herein. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement
that is important to you. This section is not intended to provide you with any factual information about PacWest or CUB. Such information
can be found elsewhere in this document and in the public filings PacWest and CUB make with the SEC, as described in the section
entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."

Terms of the Merger 

Transaction Structure

        PacWest's and CUB's boards of directors have approved the merger agreement. The merger agreement provides for the merger of
CUB with and into PacWest, with PacWest continuing as the surviving corporation. Immediately after the merger, CU Bank, a California
state-chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of CUB, will merge with and into Pacific Western Bank, a California state-chartered
bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of PacWest, with Pacific Western Bank as the surviving bank.

Merger Consideration

        In the merger, each CUB common share owned by a CUB shareholder, other than certain specified excluded shares and dissenting
shares described under "The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Cancellation of Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares," will
be converted into the right to receive (i) $12.00 in cash and (ii) 0.5308 of a share of PacWest common stock. For each fractional share that
would otherwise be issued, PacWest will pay cash in an amount equal to the fraction of a share of PacWest common stock which the
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive multiplied by the PacWest average closing price.

        The market value of the stock portion of the merger consideration will fluctuate with the price of PacWest common stock, and
the value of the shares of PacWest common stock that holders of CUB common shares will receive upon consummation of the
merger may be different than the value of the shares of PacWest common stock that holders of CUB common shares would receive
if calculated on the date PacWest and CUB announced the merger, on the date that this document is being mailed to CUB
shareholders, or on the date of the special meeting of CUB shareholders. Based on the closing price of PacWest common stock on
April 5, 2017, the value of the per share merger consideration payable to holders of CUB common shares was $39.45. While the
transaction value at the signing of the merger agreement represented a $0.05 discount to the closing price of CUB common shares
on April 5, 2017, the price of CUB common shares had increased approximately 10% year to date and approximately 68% since
the date of the 2016 presidential election, while the KBW Index had decreased approximately 7% and increased approximately
18% since such dates, respectively. For more discussion regarding how the increase in the price of CUB common shares was
considered by the CUB board of directors in determining to approve the merger agreement, please see the section entitled "The
Merger—Background of the Merger." Based on the closing price of PacWest common stock on July 21, 2017, the last practicable
date before the date of this document, the value of the per share merger consideration payable to holders of CUB common shares
was $37.67.

Treatment of CUB Stock Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs

        CUB Stock Options.    At the effective time, each outstanding CUB stock option, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and
will entitle the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of CUB common shares subject to
such option and (ii) the excess, if

any, of (A) an amount equal to (1) $12.00 in cash plus (2) the product of the PacWest average closing price and 0.5308 over (B) the
exercise price per CUB common share underlying such option, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment.

        CUB Restricted Shares and RSUs.    At the effective time, any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding CUB restricted share
and CUB RSU will automatically accelerate in full and such CUB restricted shares and CUB RSUs will be converted into, and become
exchanged for, the merger consideration, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting.

Background of the Merger 

        The CUB board of directors and executive management team regularly review and assess strategic opportunities that may be available
to CUB. In addition, the CUB board of directors and executive management team hold an annual strategic planning retreat which, over the
last three years, has had as its primary focus a discussion of strategic options potentially available to CUB, with the goal of enhancing
value for CUB shareholders. The most recent strategic planning retreat was held in early November 2016. As part of the strategic planning
process at this retreat, the CUB board of directors compared the benefits and challenges of continuing as an independent bank to the
benefits and challenges of engaging in a strategic combination with another institution. The CUB board of directors considered a number
of factors, including the growth and composition of CU Bank's loan portfolio, CU Bank's deposit franchise, management succession,
economic indicators and regulatory developments and requirements. The CUB board of directors also invited KBW to address types of
strategic alternatives potentially available to CUB. After considering the presentation by KBW and other discussions, and in an effort to
develop better information regarding CUB's strategic options involving combinations with larger banks, the CUB board of directors
directed Mr. Rainer, CUB's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, with the assistance of KBW, to reach out informally to likely potential
merger partners to establish a relationship that would allow CUB to gauge their interest in considering a transaction with CUB and obtain a
sense of their merger philosophies and estimated valuations for CUB.

        In its presentation at the November retreat, KBW listed a number of financial institutions, including PacWest, that could be potential
merger partners based on, among other things, market capitalization, prospects, reputation and business and cultural alignment. Between
November 2016 and February 2017, representatives of KBW and/or Mr. Rainer contacted nine financial institutions that had been included
on the KBW list from the November retreat. The discussions were preliminary and informal. CUB did not provide nonpublic due diligence
information and did not enter into confidentiality agreements with any of those parties other than PacWest. During that same period, stock
prices for financial institutions were benefiting from a post-election rise, which saw the KBW Index experience a greater than 20%
increase, and which saw CUB's share price experience a steady increase of more than 70%, from $23.15 on November 3, 2016, the first
day of the CUB board of directors' 2016 retreat, to $39.55 on February 21, 2017, the day prior to the first discussion with PacWest. As
explained to KBW and then communicated to Mr. Rainer, none of the other parties was interested in exploring detailed discussions with
CUB at that time, primarily due to CUB's purchase price expectation that the merger consideration would reflect the recent appreciation in
CUB's share price.

        Mr. Rainer reported to the CUB board of directors in the executive session at its February 7, 2017 meeting on the feedback given to
KBW and Mr. Rainer by potential merger candidates. The CUB board of directors discussed the input and directed Mr. Rainer and KBW
to continue the investigation of the market to determine whether there were parties who would be interested in a transaction with CUB at a
valuation that would reflect its then-current share price.

        On February 22, 2017, KBW reached out to Matthew P. Wagner, Chief Executive Officer of PacWest, to explore PacWest's interest in
a potential merger with CUB at a price that, among other things, would reflect CUB's then-current share price, which as of that date had
climbed to $39.55.

Mr. Wagner expressed an interest in further discussions. Thereafter, KBW arranged a meeting on February 27, 2017 between Mr. Wagner
and Mr. Rainer to continue to discuss PacWest's interest in a potential merger with CUB. At that meeting, Mr. Wagner expressed an
interest in engaging in a more in-depth discussion regarding a potential merger between PacWest and CUB, and Mr. Rainer informed
Mr. Wagner that he believed that the CUB board of directors would be looking for a premium for CUB shareholders over the current
market price. The next day, KBW, on behalf of CUB, sent PacWest a form of a mutual non-disclosure agreement, pursuant to which CUB
and PacWest each agreed to keep the other's proprietary information and the merger discussions confidential and for a period of one year
to refrain from directly or indirectly acquiring more than 5.0% of the other's outstanding shares or assets without the prior approval of the
other party's board of directors. The mutual non-disclosure agreement also included restrictions on representatives of CUB and PacWest
who were provided access to the other party's customer or employee information from soliciting such customers or the other party's
employees for a period of one year. The mutual non-disclosure agreement was executed on March 3, 2017. On that same day, based on
previous guidance from the CUB board of directors, KBW informed PacWest's financial advisor, Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., referred
to as Sandler, that CUB expected no less than $42.00 per share. Sandler responded that PacWest was adamant that it would not pay more
than $40.00 per share.

        On March 7, 2017, PacWest sent CUB a draft non-binding letter of intent, referred to as the LOI, outlining a potential merger. The
draft LOI called for a merger of CUB into PacWest in which CUB shareholders would receive 0.7101 of a share of PacWest common stock
for each CUB common share, or an implied price of $40.00 per CUB common share, based on the March 6, 2017 closing price for
PacWest of $56.33 per share. CUB's closing price on March 6, 2017 was $38.10 per share. The draft LOI contemplated that Mr. Rainer
would join PacWest's board of directors and CUB's directors and executive officers would execute non-solicitation and non-competition
agreements. Further, the draft LOI provided PacWest 60 days of exclusivity from the date of the draft LOI to draft and negotiate a
definitive merger agreement.

        At a special telephonic meeting of the CUB board of directors on March 8, 2017, Mr. Rainer and Anita Wolman, CUB's General
Counsel, outlined the principal terms of the draft LOI and summarized the previous discussions between KBW and Mr. Rainer, on behalf
of CUB, and PacWest. Ms. Wolman reminded the CUB board of directors that this matter was confidential and that that there could be no
trading in CUB common shares or PacWest common stock until further notice by Ms. Wolman. Recognizing that the CUB board of
directors and CUB management needed sufficient time to analyze the terms of the draft LOI, engage outside counsel and negotiate the
terms of an engagement with KBW, the CUB board of directors agreed to meet later in the week and agreed at the meeting to ratify the
execution of the mutual non-disclosure agreement with PacWest. To facilitate the negotiation process, and in furtherance of the exercise of
the CUB board of directors' fiduciary duty, the CUB board of directors also formed the Special Transactions Committee, referred to as the
Special Committee, and appointed to the Special Committee three independent directors with the requisite background and experience to
serve in that capacity, namely Mr. Holman, CUB's Lead Independent Director and former and long-time commercial bank executive,
Mr. Kentor, a corporate attorney and former General Counsel and Executive Management Committee member at MiniMed Inc., and
Mr. Salter, former global leader of FTI Consulting's Valuation and Financial Advisory Services group. The CUB board of directors
appointed Mr. Kentor as Special Committee Chairman, adopted a Special Committee Charter and authorized the Special Committee to
review, consider, evaluate and direct and oversee the negotiation of the terms and conditions of the draft LOI and possibly a definitive
merger agreement and make recommendations for or against the draft LOI and the proposed merger to the CUB board of directors.

        On March 9, 2017, the Special Committee met at the offices of CUB's outside legal counsel, Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP, referred
to as Manatt, to discuss the draft LOI. In addition to the members of the Special Committee, the meeting was attended by Mr. Rainer,
Ms. Wolman, Karen

Schoenbaum, CUB's Chief Financial Officer, a lawyer from Manatt and representatives from KBW. Manatt reviewed its presentation on
fiduciary duties given to the full CUB board of directors at two different previous annual retreats, and discussed in detail the CUB
directors' legal duties applicable to their consideration of a strategic transaction. Representatives of KBW then discussed a preliminary
financial analysis of each of CUB and PacWest on a standalone basis and in the context of the proposed merger. The Special Committee
also discussed with Manatt and KBW the impact of a provision in the draft LOI pursuant to which CUB could terminate the merger
agreement in the event that PacWest's volume weighted average stock price over a determined period prior to the closing (i) declined by
more than 15%, and (ii) underperformed the KBW Index by greater than 15%, subject to PacWest's ability to reinstate the transaction by
adjusting the merger consideration to fill the shortfall either by including a cash component, an adjusted exchange ratio or both. KBW
discussed the recent increase in bank stock prices in general and the even-greater increase in CUB's share price, and how that impacted the
pricing of the proposed merger. KBW advised that, based on its analysis, the receipt of a comparable or better offer was not reasonably
likely. Following the report by KBW, the Special Committee discussed potential synergies in a strategic transaction with PacWest; the
scope and results of the market outreach efforts conducted by Mr. Rainer and KBW since November 2016; the overlap between PacWest
and CUB's operations; the importance to PacWest of CUB's deposit relationships; PacWest's dividend payment history; the significant
increase in trading liquidity that would inure to the benefit of CUB shareholders from a merger with PacWest; and the likelihood of
consummating a strategic transaction with PacWest on a timely basis, considering PacWest's experience in completing acquisitions of
financial institutions the size of CUB, including its recent acquisition of Square 1 Financial, Inc., referred to as Square 1. The Special
Committee, KBW, Manatt and CUB executive management then discussed the proposed merger consideration in detail, including whether
PacWest would be willing to increase the exchange ratio and the advisability of any price protections, such as a collar. Mr. Rainer and
KBW reported that they did not believe there was an opportunity to increase the merger consideration based upon conversations with
Mr. Wagner and Sandler. Mr. Rainer and KBW also reported that they believed there was a risk that PacWest would terminate discussions
if CUB were to attempt to negotiate further on merger consideration, including both the amount and the inclusion of price protections.
KBW also advised that the inclusion of price protections such as a collar may not be in the best interests of CUB shareholders given the
relative valuations of CUB and PacWest. The Special Committee questioned KBW about the provision in the draft LOI requiring non-
employee directors to execute non-competition agreements and specifically asked whether it was customary. KBW explained that it was
more customary to limit non-competition agreements to members of executive management responsible for significant customer
relationships and strategic initiatives. The Special Committee then asked KBW whether PacWest would consider entering into consulting
agreements with reasonable non-competition clauses for Mr. Rainer and Mr. Horton and perhaps other key members of management.
KBW agreed to follow up with Sandler about the consulting agreements.

        KBW was excused from the meeting so the Special Committee could discuss KBW's draft engagement letter that had previously been
distributed to the members of the Special Committee. Taking into consideration the services KBW had performed on behalf of CUB since
November and its review of investment banking compensation in comparable transactions, the Special Committee resolved to recommend
to the CUB board of directors that CUB formally engage KBW on the material terms proposed. The Special Committee also resolved to
recommend to the CUB board of directors that CUB execute the draft LOI with PacWest subject to, among other things, clarifying CUB's
right to conduct reverse due diligence, limiting the persons required to execute non-competition agreements to certain executive officers
and modifying the board representation provision to provide for either Mr. Rainer or another mutually agreed upon CUB director to join
the PacWest board of directors upon the closing of the proposed transaction.

        On March 10, 2017, the full CUB board of directors met telephonically. Representatives of KBW and Manatt and members of CUB
executive management participated in the meeting. KBW discussed PacWest's proposed deal terms, including a preliminary financial
analysis of the parties and the proposed transaction. Representatives of Manatt reminded the CUB directors of their fiduciary duties in the
context of a strategic transaction, as well as restrictions on trading in the stock of both CUB and PacWest and the importance of
confidentiality. The CUB board of directors discussed the status of CUB's business options, recent macro-economic and regulatory trends
and CUB's organic and strategic growth possibilities, including taking into account expansionary limitations imposed on CUB due to the
Consent Order, dated September 23, 2016, among CU Bank, the FDIC and the CDBO, referred to as the Consent Order. Mr. Rainer
reiterated portions of the discussions from the November 2016 strategic planning retreat regarding the challenges and opportunities for
CUB if it remained independent, as well as the opportunity presented for CUB shareholders by the significant increase in CUB's share
price. The Special Committee summarized for the CUB board of directors its findings and recommendations with respect to entering into
the engagement agreement with KBW and executing the LOI, copies of each of which had previously been delivered to the CUB board of
directors. After careful consideration of PacWest's offer, the current regulatory environment and uncertainties of the market and the
economy, as well as discussions with Manatt and KBW, the CUB board of directors instructed management to sign the LOI and instructed
the Special Committee to oversee further negotiations with PacWest regarding a definitive agreement. PacWest returned the countersigned
LOI that same day.

        Following the execution of the LOI, representatives of management and the outside advisors to PacWest and CUB began more
detailed discussions on the potential transaction, and Sandler sent an initial due diligence request list to KBW to allow PacWest and its
advisors to commence credit, operational and legal due diligence of CUB through an online dataroom established on March 14, 2017.
KBW and Manatt reviewed financial and other information regarding PacWest, including documentation for PacWest's recent acquisition
of Square 1.

        On March 14, 2017, the CUB board of directors held a special meeting. Representatives from Manatt and members of CUB's
executive management attended the meeting. Mr. Rainer advised the CUB board of directors that PacWest desired to sign a definitive
agreement in early April and close a transaction, subject to the receipt of the requisite approvals and satisfaction of closing conditions, in
the fourth quarter of 2017. He called upon representatives from Manatt to discuss the approval process for the proposed merger
transaction, PacWest's proposed timeline and possible events that could disrupt the process and/or delay the closing, including a review by
the SEC of PacWest's Form S-4, Community Reinvestment Act objections, protests or hearings and shareholder litigation related to the
merger. A representative from Manatt advised the CUB board of directors on issues related to shareholder litigation that sometimes follow
merger announcements by public companies. KBW was formally engaged as of March 15, 2017.

        On March 16, 2017, PacWest and Pacific Western Bank held a joint meeting of their boards of directors at which they and members
of PacWest's executive management team discussed the strategic rationale and status of the negotiations with CUB. Mr. Wagner discussed
with the joint boards of directors, among other things, the proposed consideration contained in the LOI, CUB's strong deposit base and low
cost of deposits, CUB's exceptional credit and asset composition, CUB's business model and its similarities to PacWest's, and the Consent
Order and the remediation steps undertaken by CUB to address the matters noted therein.

        On March 21, 2017, PacWest's outside legal counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, referred to as S&C, sent an initial draft of a
definitive merger agreement to Manatt. On March 22, 2017, the Special Committee met telephonically. Representatives from Manatt, as
well as Mr. Rainer and Ms. Wolman, participated in the meeting. Manatt explained that based on its initial review, the draft merger
agreement was similar in form and content to the merger agreement for the Square 1 transaction that

had previously been distributed to the Special Committee and that it was continuing to review the draft merger agreement. Mr. Rainer told
the Special Committee that KBW had informed him that KBW had followed up with Sandler to request that PacWest consider entering
into consulting or non-competition agreements with Mr. Rainer, Mr. Horton and Ms. Schoenbaum and that Sandler recently reported back
that PacWest intended to offer consulting agreements to those three executive officers. The Special Committee requested that Manatt
communicate with S&C to ensure that drafts of the ancillary agreements, including the voting, non-competition, non-solicitation
agreements and consulting agreements were delivered to Manatt at the earliest possible time. Mr. Rainer also explained that
representatives from KBW would be attending the meeting of the CUB board of directors scheduled for the following day at which time
they would discuss with the CUB board of directors the impact on the transaction of the downward trend in the price of PacWest's stock
since the date the LOI was signed, including possible changes to the merger consideration such as adding cash or changing the exchange
ratio.

        At the meeting of the CUB board of directors on March 23, 2017, representatives from KBW discussed the decrease in PacWest's
stock price since March 10, 2017. KBW discussed, among other things, the market factors weighing on bank stock prices generally, noting
that PacWest's stock had performed in line with the KBW Index over that same time period. The CUB board of directors and KBW
readdressed the benefits and risks of a fixed exchange ratio transaction and considered the impact of a "take under" transaction, where the
value of the merger consideration at announcement is less than the trading price of the target's stock. With respect to the risks of a take
under transaction, KBW explained that KBW's analysis of the fairness of the proposed transaction would be based on the value of CUB
using various financial analyses and not on the daily changes in the stock prices of PacWest and CUB. The CUB board of directors then
asked KBW to discuss the possibility that PacWest would add cash to the merger consideration. The Special Committee and Mr. Rainer
informed the CUB board of directors that they had directed KBW to discuss with Sandler augmenting the proposed merger consideration,
and KBW told the CUB board of directors that those discussions between KBW and Sandler had begun. A representative from Manatt
then outlined for the CUB board of directors provisions in the draft merger agreement that warranted further discussion with S&C and
provisions in the merger agreement that were still under review.

        Between March 23, 2017 and April 3, 2017, representatives of CUB and PacWest and their respective legal counsel and financial
advisors, conducted negotiations regarding the terms of the merger transaction, including, among other terms, the process and timing of
the repurchase of CUB's Series A preferred stock held by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the scope of the representations, warranties,
covenants and closing conditions, employee retention and severance, board representation, tax opinions and termination provisions and
termination fees. In addition, the terms of voting, non-solicitation and consulting agreements between PacWest and the individual directors
of CUB and certain executive officers of CUB were negotiated.

        On March 27, 2017, Sandler sent a supplemental due diligence request list to KBW, requesting additional materials to be made
available to allow PacWest and its advisors to continue credit, operational and legal due diligence of CUB. Sandler was formally engaged
by PacWest as of March 28, 2017.

        On March 28, 2017, members of CUB's executive management team, along with a representative from KBW, interviewed members
of PacWest's executive management at PacWest's headquarters, as part of CUB's reverse due diligence investigation of PacWest and in
response to a written reverse due diligence request list delivered to PacWest's financial advisor on March 23, 2017. During this meeting,
CUB received information from PacWest's executive management team regarding, among other things, history of recent acquisition
activity and benefits received, their assessment of PacWest's strengths and weaknesses and information on PacWest's prospects, loan
quality, compliance with regulatory requirements, information technology and pending litigation.

        During the period from March 23, 2017 through April 5, 2017, Mr. Rainer and the Special Committee met or communicated regularly
to discuss the changes in the price of PacWest common stock, the status of the due diligence process, plans for communications with
CUB's staff, customers, shareholders and regulators and negotiation of the proposed merger terms, including, among other things,
employee retention and severance arrangements. Representatives from Manatt and KBW were also in attendance.

        On April 3, 2017, Sandler contacted KBW regarding a proposed alternative pricing structure for the transaction, providing for 70%
PacWest common stock and 30% cash consideration through a fixed exchange ratio of 0.5308, plus $12.00 in cash per share. The revised
exchange ratio was set based on PacWest's common stock price of $52.75 as of April 3, 2017, which resulted in the value of the merger
consideration being equal to $40.00, the value as negotiated pursuant to PacWest's first offer to CUB per the LOI. Each of the Special
Committee members supported the change, subject to reviewing KBW's analysis. On April 4, 2017, PacWest delivered to each of
Messrs. Rainer and Horton agreements regarding consulting services to be rendered for PacWest following the merger. On April 5, 2017,
PacWest delivered to Ms. Schoenbaum an agreement regarding consulting services to be rendered for PacWest following the merger. See
"—Interests of CUB Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

        On April 5, 2017, a special meeting of the CUB board of directors was held. Representatives of KBW and Manatt participated. KBW
and Manatt summarized the negotiations that had taken place and reviewed the change in the merger consideration to be received by the
CUB shareholders, including comparing the original merger consideration offered to the current offer. Executive management of CUB
reported on the satisfactory results of its reverse due diligence meeting with PacWest's senior management. The CUB board of directors
also considered PacWest's stock price performance as compared to that of CUB's common shares and the KBW Index since 2015. At this
meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed transaction and rendered to the CUB board of directors an oral opinion
(later confirmed in writing) to the effect that, as of April 4, 2017 and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters
considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in its opinion, the merger consideration in the
proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of CUB common shares. Manatt then reviewed with the CUB
board of directors the CUB directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law. Following this review, Manatt outlined for the directors the
terms of the merger agreement, a marked copy of which had been distributed to the directors prior to the meeting, and the related voting
agreements, non-solicitation agreements and consulting agreements to be entered into in connection therewith, copies of which had been
made available to the directors in advance of the meeting. The CUB board of directors then engaged in a vigorous discussion of the terms
of the agreements, and the representatives of Manatt and KBW answered the CUB directors' various questions. After extensive discussion
and taking into account the factors described below under "—Recommendation of the CUB Board of Directors and Reasons for the
Merger", the CUB board of directors adopted resolutions approving the merger agreement and transactions contemplated thereby.

        On April 5, 2017, a special meeting of the PacWest board of directors was also held. Representatives of Sandler and S&C
participated. Sandler and S&C summarized the negotiations that had taken place and reviewed the merger consideration to be paid by
PacWest. S&C outlined for the PacWest directors the terms of the merger agreement, a marked copy of which had been distributed to the
PacWest directors prior to the meeting, and the related voting agreements, non-solicitation agreements and consulting agreements to be
entered into in connection therewith, copies of which had been made available to the PacWest directors in advance of the meeting. S&C
then reviewed with the PacWest board of directors the PacWest directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law. The PacWest board of
directors then engaged in a vigorous discussion of the terms of the agreements and the representatives of S&C and Sandler answered the
PacWest directors' various questions. After extensive discussion and taking into account the factors described below under "—PacWest's

Merger", the PacWest board of directors adopted resolutions approving the merger agreement and transactions contemplated thereby.

        Following the CUB and PacWest boards of directors meetings, the terms of the merger agreement and related agreements were
finalized, and the agreements were executed and delivered. The transaction was publicly announced on the morning of April 6, 2017, in a
press release jointly issued by CUB and PacWest. Based on a $51.72 per share closing price of PacWest common stock on April 5, 2017,
the aggregate merger consideration was approximately $705 million, or $39.45 per share.

Recommendation of the CUB Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger 

        The CUB board of directors has determined that the merger is fair to and in the best interests of CUB and its shareholders and, by the
unanimous vote of all of the directors of CUB, approved and adopted the merger agreement and the merger. ACCORDINGLY, THE CUB
BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT ALL HOLDERS OF CUB COMMON SHARES VOTE "FOR"
THE MERGER PROPOSAL.

        In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, the CUB board of directors
evaluated the merger agreement in consultation with CU Bank's executive management and determined that the merger was the best option
reasonably available for its shareholders in the current challenging and uncertain banking market. The CUB board of directors also
consulted with its legal counsel regarding its fiduciary duties, the terms of the merger agreement and related issues, and reviewed with its
financial advisors and its executive management, the financial aspects of the proposed transaction, considerations of the broader financial
market and the fairness of the transaction to the shareholders from a financial point of view, among other matters.

        In reaching its determination to approve the merger agreement, the CUB board of directors considered all factors it deemed material.
The CUB board of directors analyzed information with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects of
CUB. In this regard, the CUB board of directors considered the performance trends of CUB over the past several years. The board also
considered the ability of CUB to grow as an independent institution, the impact of the Consent Order (discussed in the section entitled "—
Background of the Merger") on CUB's ability to expand its operations through acquisitions, its ability to further enhance shareholder value
without engaging in a strategic transaction and the opportunity for CUB's shareholders to derive the benefit of the recent increase in CUB's
share price, which was significantly greater than the increase experienced by its peer institutions and the KBW Index. In this regard, the
CUB board of directors considered the long-term as well as the short-term interests of CUB and its shareholders, including whether those
interests might best be served by continued independence.

        In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger, the CUB board of directors also considered a number of
factors, including the following:

• information with respect to CUB's business, earnings, operations, financial condition, asset quality and prospects, and
information with respect to PacWest's business, earnings, operations, financial condition, asset quality and prospects, the
potential cost savings and synergies unique to a transaction between CUB and PacWest, taking into account the results of
CUB's due diligence review of PacWest and information provided by PacWest's management; 

• the recent increase of CUB's share price relative to its peer institutions and the opportunity presented by the PacWest
merger for CUB shareholders to capitalize on this price increase, in particular through the significant cash component of
the merger consideration; 

• the lack of prospects for a superior offer for a strategic combination; 

• its knowledge of the current environment in the financial services industry, including national, regional and local economic
conditions and the interest rate environment, continued

consolidation, the uncertainties in the regulatory climate for financial institutions, increased operating costs resulting from
regulatory initiatives and compliance mandates, including increasing capital requirements, increasing competition, the
current environment for community banks, particularly in Southern California, and current financial market conditions;

• the financial and growth prospects for CUB and its shareholders in a business combination with PacWest as compared to
continuing to operate as a stand-alone entity; 

• the greater market capitalization and trading liquidity of PacWest common stock in the event that CUB shareholders desire
to sell the shares of PacWest common stock to be received by them following completion of the merger; 

• the merger consideration in the transaction where the stock component will allow CUB's shareholders to continue to
participate in the future success of PacWest and derive the benefits from PacWest's dividends and any synergies achieved or
any future transactions that might be pursued by PacWest as well as the cash component, which will allow CUB's
shareholders to "de-risk"; 

• PacWest's successful track record, including, among other things, with respect to the integration of acquisitions; 

• the benefits to CUB and its customers of operating as part of a larger organization, including higher lending limits,
potential enhancements to products and services, mitigation of business risks through diversification and greater financial
resources; 

• the career opportunities afforded by a larger organization; 

• its belief that combining the two companies would create a larger and more diversified financial institution that is both
better equipped to respond to economic and industry developments and better positioned to develop and build on its
existing market position in Southern California; 

• its assessment of the likelihood that the merger would be completed in a timely manner, including the likelihood that the
merger will receive all necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner; 

• the results of discussions with third parties that the CUB board of directors believed, in consultation with its financial
advisor, were the parties likely to have the strategic interest and financial capability to pursue a potential strategic
transaction with CUB; 

• the financial analyses presented by representatives of KBW to the CUB board of directors with respect to PacWest and the
merger, and the opinion of KBW that, as of the date of that opinion and subject to the qualifications and assumptions set
forth in the opinion, the merger consideration was fair to the holders of CUB common shares from a financial point of view
(see "—Opinion of CUB's Financial Advisor"); 

• the CUB board of directors' belief that the merger consideration exceeds CUB's likely value in the absence of a merger,
including its potential for future growth, which belief was based on a number of factors, including: 

• the risks and uncertainties associated with maintaining CUB's performance as a standalone company; and 

• the CUB board of directors' analysis of other strategic alternatives available to CUB; 

• the expectation that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" for United States federal income tax purposes; and 

• the terms of the merger agreement, including the fixed exchange ratio, the form of merger consideration and the inclusion
of a significant cash component, expected tax treatment, the

achievability of the closing conditions, deal protection and termination fee provisions, which it reviewed with its outside
legal and financial advisors, which terms are described more fully under the section entitled "The Merger Agreement".

        In the course of its deliberations regarding the merger, the CUB board of directors also considered potential risks and potentially
negative factors associated with the merger, including the following material factors:

• the need to obtain approval by shareholders of CUB, as well as regulatory approvals, in order to complete the transaction
and the risk that those or other conditions will not be satisfied; 

• the risks associated with the operations of the combined company including the challenges both of integrating CUB's
business, operations and employees with those of PacWest and of achieving the anticipated cost savings; 

• the fact that the value of the aggregate and per share merger consideration will fluctuate with the market price of PacWest's
common stock and the risk that PacWest's common stock price might decline reducing the aggregate and per share merger
consideration from the values at the time the merger agreement was approved; 

• the potential risk of diverting management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational
matters while working to implement the merger; 

• the risk of potential employee attrition or negative effects on CUB's business and customer relationships as a result of the
pending merger; 

• the merger-related costs; 

• the fact that executive officers of CUB have interests in the merger and have arrangements that are different from or in
addition to those of CUB shareholders generally; and 

• the fact that CUB would be prohibited from affirmatively soliciting acquisition proposals after execution of the merger
agreement and will be obligated to pay a termination fee of $26.5 million to PacWest if the merger agreement is terminated
under certain circumstances, all of which may discourage other parties potentially interested in a strategic transaction with
CUB from pursuing such a transaction.

        This description of the information and factors considered by the CUB board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but is
believed to include all material factors the CUB board of directors considered. In determining whether to approve and recommend the
merger agreement, the CUB board of directors did not assign any relative or specific weights to any of the foregoing factors, and
individual directors may have weighed factors differently. After deliberating with respect to the merger and the merger agreement,
considering, among other things, the reasons discussed above, the CUB board of directors approved the merger agreement and the merger
as being in the best interests of CUB and its shareholders, based on the total mix of information available to the CUB board of directors.

        This explanation of CUB's reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and
should be read in light of the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

Opinion of CUB's Financial Advisor 

        CUB engaged KBW to render financial advisory and investment banking services to CUB, including rendering an opinion to the
CUB board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of CUB common shares of the merger
consideration to be received by such shareholders in the proposed merger of CUB with and into PacWest. CUB selected KBW because
KBW is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in transactions

similar to the merger. As part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of financial services
businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions.

        As part of its engagement, representatives of KBW attended the meeting of the CUB board of directors held on April 5, 2017, at
which the CUB board of directors evaluated the proposed merger. At this meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed
merger and rendered to the CUB board of directors an opinion to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the procedures followed,
assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in its opinion, the
merger consideration in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of CUB common shares. The CUB
board of directors unanimously approved the merger agreement at this meeting.

        The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is attached
as Appendix D to this document and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the procedures followed, assumptions made,
matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in preparing the opinion.

        KBW's opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the
CUB board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the merger. The
opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the merger consideration in the
merger to the holders of CUB common shares. It did not address, among other things as set forth in KBW's opinion, the
underlying business decision of CUB to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation
to the CUB board of directors in connection with the merger, and it does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of CUB
common shares or any shareholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the merger or any other matter, nor
does it constitute a recommendation regarding whether or not any such shareholder should enter into a voting, shareholders' or
affiliates' agreement with respect to the merger or exercise any dissenters' or appraisal rights that may be available to such
shareholder.

        KBW's opinion was reviewed and approved by KBW's Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with KBW's policies and
procedures established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

        In connection with the opinion, KBW reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating condition
of CUB and PacWest and bearing upon the merger, including, among other things, the following:

• a draft of the merger agreement dated April 4, 2017 (the most recent draft then made available to KBW); 

• the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016
of CUB; 

• the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016
of PacWest; 

• certain regulatory filings of CUB and PacWest and their respective subsidiaries, including the quarterly reports on Form FR
Y-9C and call reports filed with respect to each quarter during the three year period ended December 31, 2016; 

• certain other interim reports and other communications of CUB and PacWest to their respective shareholders; and 

• other financial information concerning the businesses and operations of CUB and PacWest that was furnished to KBW by
CUB and PacWest or which KBW was otherwise directed to use for purposes of KBW's analyses.

        KBW's consideration of financial information and other factors that it deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to its
analyses included, among others, the following:

• the historical and current financial position and results of operations of CUB and PacWest; 

• the assets and liabilities of CUB and PacWest; 

• the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry; 

• a comparison of certain financial and stock market information for CUB and PacWest with similar information for certain
other companies the securities of which were publicly traded; 

• publicly available consensus "street estimates" of CUB for 2017 and 2018, as well as assumed long-term CUB growth rates
provided to KBW by CUB management, all of which information was discussed with KBW by such management and used
and relied upon by KBW at the direction of CUB management and with the consent of the CUB board of directors; 

• publicly available consensus "street estimates" of PacWest for 2017 and 2018, as well as assumed long-term PacWest
growth rates that were discussed with KBW by PacWest management and used and relied upon by KBW based on such
discussions, at the direction of CUB management and with the consent of the CUB board of directors; and 

• estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the merger on PacWest (including, without limitation, the cost
savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the merger) that were prepared by, and provided to and
discussed with KBW by the management of PacWest, and used and relied upon by KBW based on such discussions, at the
direction of CUB management and with the consent of the CUB board of directors.

        KBW also performed such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate and took into account its assessment of general
economic, market and financial conditions and its experience in other transactions, as well as its experience in securities valuation and
knowledge of the banking industry generally. KBW also participated in discussions with the managements of CUB and PacWest regarding
the past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and future prospects of their respective companies and
such other matters as KBW deemed relevant to its inquiry. In addition, KBW considered the results of the efforts undertaken, with KBW's
assistance, by or on behalf of and at the direction of CUB, to solicit indications of interest from third parties regarding a potential
transaction with CUB.

        In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, KBW relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information that was provided to it or that was publicly available and did not independently verify the accuracy or
completeness of any such information or assume any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. KBW
relied upon the management of CUB as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus "street estimates" of
CUB and the assumed CUB long-term growth rates referred to above, and KBW assumed that such information was reasonably prepared
and represents, or in the case of the publicly available consensus "street estimates" of CUB that such information is consistent with, the
best currently available estimates and judgments of CUB management and that such forecasts, projections and estimates would be realized
in the amounts and in the time periods estimated. KBW further relied, with the consent of CUB, upon PacWest management as to the
reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus "street estimates" of PacWest and the assumed PacWest long-term
growth rates referred to above, as well as the estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the merger on PacWest (and the
assumptions and bases therefor, including without limitation the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from
the merger) referred to above, and KBW assumed, with the consent of CUB, that such information was reasonably prepared

and represents, or in the case of the publicly available consensus "street estimates" of PacWest that such information was consistent with,
the best currently available estimates and judgments of PacWest management and that such forecasts, projections and estimates would be
realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated.

        It is understood that the forecasts, projections and estimates of CUB and PacWest provided to KBW were not prepared with the
expectation of public disclosure and that such information, together with the publicly available consensus "street estimates" of CUB and
PacWest referred to above that KBW was directed to use, was based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain,
including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and that, accordingly, actual results could
vary significantly from those set forth in such information. KBW assumed, based on discussions with the respective managements of CUB
and PacWest and with the consent of the CUB board of directors, that all such information provided a reasonable basis upon which KBW
could form its opinion and KBW expressed no view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. KBW relied on all
such information without independent verification or analysis and did not in any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the
accuracy or completeness thereof.

        KBW also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business or
prospects of either CUB or PacWest since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made available to KBW.
KBW is not an expert in the independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for loan and lease losses and KBW assumed, without
independent verification and with CUB's consent, that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for CUB and PacWest are
adequate to cover such losses. In rendering its opinion, KBW did not make or obtain any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection
of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of CUB or PacWest, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or
the collectability of any such assets, nor did KBW examine any individual loan or credit files, nor did it evaluate the solvency, financial
capability or fair value of CUB or PacWest under any state or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other
matters. Estimates of values of companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or
assets may actually be sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, KBW assumed no responsibility or liability for
their accuracy.

        KBW assumed, in all respects material to its analyses:

• that the merger would be completed substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement (the final
terms of which KBW assumed would not differ in any respect material to KBW's analyses from the draft reviewed by
KBW and referred to above) with no adjustments to the merger consideration and with no additional payments in respect of
the CUB common shares; 

• that any related transactions (including the bank merger and the repurchase of the Series A preferred stock) would be
completed as contemplated in the merger agreement and as further described to KBW by representatives of CUB; 

• that the representations and warranties of each party in the merger agreement and in all related documents and instruments
referred to in the merger agreement were true and correct; 

• that each party to the merger agreement and all related documents would perform all of the covenants and agreements
required to be performed by such party under such documents; 

• that there were no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental
approval for the merger or any related transactions (including the bank merger and the repurchase of the Series A preferred
stock) and that all conditions to the

completion of the merger and any related transaction would be satisfied without any waivers or modifications to the merger
agreement or any of the related documents; and

• that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the merger and any
related transaction (including the bank merger and the repurchase of the Series A preferred stock), no restrictions, including
any divestiture requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would
have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of CUB, PacWest or the pro forma
entity, or the contemplated benefits of the merger, including, without limitation the cost savings and related expenses
expected to result or be derived from the merger.

        KBW assumed that the merger would be consummated in a manner that complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and
regulations. KBW was further advised by representatives of CUB that CUB relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or
other appropriate sources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to CUB, PacWest, the
merger and any related transaction (including the bank merger and the repurchase of the Series A preferred stock), and the merger
agreement. KBW did not provide advice with respect to any such matters.

        KBW's opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of CUB
common shares of the merger consideration to be received by such holders in the merger. KBW expressed no view or opinion as to any
other terms or aspects of the merger or any term or aspect of any related transaction (including the bank merger and the repurchase of the
Series A preferred stock), including without limitation, the form or structure of the merger (including the form of the merger consideration
or the allocation thereof between cash and stock) or any related transaction, any consequences of the merger or any related transaction to
CUB, its shareholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or implications of any employment, consulting, voting, support,
shareholder or other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the merger or otherwise.
KBW's opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of such opinion and the
information made available to KBW through such date. Developments subsequent to the date of KBW's opinion may have affected, and
may affect, the conclusion reached in KBW's opinion and KBW did not and does not have an obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its
opinion. KBW's opinion did not address, and KBW expressed no view or opinion with respect to:

• the underlying business decision of CUB to engage in the merger or enter into the merger agreement; 

• the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been or may be available to or
contemplated by CUB or the CUB board of directors; 

• the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of CUB's officers, directors or employees, or any class of
such persons, relative to the compensation to the holders of CUB common shares; 

• the effect of the merger or any related transaction on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any
class of securities of CUB (other than the holders of CUB common shares, solely with respect to the merger consideration
as described in KBW's opinion and not relative to the consideration to be received by holders of any other class of
securities) or holders of any class of securities of PacWest or any other party to any transaction contemplated by the merger
agreement;

• whether PacWest has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to pay the aggregate
amount of the cash consideration to the holders of CUB common shares at the closing of the merger; 

• whether CUB has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to effect the repurchase of
the Series A preferred stock concurrently with or prior to the closing of the merger; 

• any adjustment (as provided in the merger agreement) to the merger consideration assumed for purposes of KBW's
opinion; 

• the actual value of PacWest common stock to be issued in the merger; 

• the prices, trading range or volume at which CUB common shares or PacWest common stock would trade following the
public announcement of the merger or the prices, trading range or volume at which PacWest common stock would trade
following the consummation of the merger; 

• any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the merger or any other transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement; or 

• any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to CUB, PacWest, their respective shareholders, or relating
to or arising out of or as a consequence of the merger or any related transaction (including the bank merger and the
repurchase of the Series A preferred stock), including whether or not the merger would qualify as a tax-free reorganization
for United States federal income tax purposes.

        In performing its analyses, KBW made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KBW, CUB and PacWest. Any estimates contained in
the analyses performed by KBW are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than suggested by these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals
or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the KBW opinion was among several factors taken into consideration by the CUB
board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the merger. Consequently, the analyses described
below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the CUB board of directors with respect to the fairness of the merger
consideration. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were determined through negotiation between CUB and
PacWest and the decision of CUB to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the CUB board of directors.

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by KBW and presented by KBW to the CUB board of
directors in connection with KBW's opinion. The summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses underlying the opinion
or the presentation made by KBW to the CUB board of directors, but summarizes the material analyses performed or presented in
connection with such opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone
do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process
involving various determinations as to appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at
its opinion, KBW did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments
as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, KBW believes that its analyses and the summary of its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented
below in tabular format, without considering all analyses and

factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses,
could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.

        For purposes of the financial analyses described below, KBW utilized an implied value of the merger consideration of $40.07 per
CUB common share, consisting of the sum of (i) the implied value of the stock consideration based on the closing price of PacWest
common stock on April 4, 2017, and (ii) the cash consideration.

        CUB Comparable Companies Analyses.    Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance, financial
condition and market performance of CUB to 17 selected U.S. banks which were traded on NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange or
the New York Stock Exchange Market and headquartered in the Western Region (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) and which had total assets between $1 billion and $5 billion.
Savings banks and thrifts, ethnic-focused banks and targets of publicly announced merger transactions were excluded from the selected
companies.

        The selected companies were as follows:

        To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability and other financial information for, as of, or, in the case of latest 12 months, referred
to as LTM, information, through, the most recent completed quarter, referred to as MRQ, available (which in the case of CUB was the
fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016) and market price information as of April 4, 2017. KBW also used 2017 and 2018 EPS estimates
taken from consensus "street estimates" for CUB and the selected companies. Where consolidated holding company level financial data
for the selected companies was unreported, subsidiary bank level data was utilized to calculate ratios. Certain financial data was prepared
by KBW, and as referenced in the tables presented below, may not correspond to the data presented in CUB's historical financial
statements as a result of the different periods, assumptions and methods used by KBW to compute the financial data presented.

        The selected transactions were as follows:

        For each selected transaction, KBW derived the following implied transaction statistics, in each case based on the transaction
consideration value paid for the acquired company and using financial data based on the acquired company's then latest publicly available
financial statements prior to the announcement of the transaction:

• Price per common share to LTM EPS of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a private
acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by LTM earnings); 

• Price per common share to current year EPS consensus "street estimates" of the acquired company (in the case of selected
transactions involving a private acquired company, this transaction statistic was excluded); 

• Price per common share to next year EPS consensus "street estimates" of the acquired company (in the case of selected
transactions involving a private acquired company, this transaction statistic was excluded); 

• Price per common share to book value per share of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a
private acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by total
common equity); 

• Price per common share to tangible book value per share of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions
involving a private acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by
total tangible common equity); 

• Total transaction consideration to deposits of the acquired company; and 

• Tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than $100,000) of the acquired company,
referred to as core deposit premium.

        KBW also reviewed the price per common share paid for the acquired company for the selected transactions in which the acquired
company was publicly traded as a premium to the closing price of the acquired company one day prior to the announcement of the
acquisition (expressed as a percentage and referred to as the one-day market premium) and as a premium to the average closing price of
the acquired company for the one-month period ending one day prior to the announcement of the acquisition (expressed as a percentage
and referred to as the one-month market premium). The above transaction statistics for the selected transactions were compared with the
corresponding transaction

statistics for the proposed merger based on the implied value of the merger consideration of $40.07 per CUB common share and using
historical financial information for CUB as of December 31, 2016 and for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 and market
price information of CUB as of April 4, 2017.

        The results of the analysis are set forth in the following table:

        None of the companies or transactions used as a comparison in the above selected transaction analysis is identical to CUB or the
proposed merger, respectively. Accordingly, an analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations
and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved.

        Relative Contribution Analysis.    KBW analyzed the relative standalone contribution of PacWest and CUB to various pro forma
balance sheet and income statement items of the combined entity post consummation of the merger. This analysis did not include purchase
accounting adjustments or cost savings. To perform this analysis, KBW used (i) balance sheet and net income data for PacWest and CUB
as of December 31, 2016, and, (ii) publicly available 2017 and 2018 net income consensus "street estimates" of $366.4 million and
$400.9 million, respectively, for PacWest, as agreed by PacWest management and approved by CUB management, and 2017 and 2018
EPS consensus "street estimates" of $1.75 and $2.09, respectively, for CUB, as approved by CUB management. The results of KBW's
analysis are set forth in the following table, which also compares the results of KBW's analysis with the implied pro forma ownership
percentages of PacWest and CUB shareholders in the combined company based on the implied stock consideration of 0.5308 shares of
PacWest common stock provided for in the merger agreement (reflecting a 70.1% stock / 29.9% cash implied merger consideration mix)

also based on a hypothetical exchange ratio assuming 100% stock consideration in the proposed merger for illustrative purposes:

        Forecasted Pro Forma Financial Impact Analysis.    KBW performed a pro forma financial impact analysis that combined projected
income statement and balance sheet information of PacWest and CUB. Using closing balance sheet estimates as of December 31, 2017 for
PacWest and CUB based on publicly available consensus "street estimates," publicly available 2017 and 2018 net income consensus
"street estimates" of $366.4 million and $400.9 million, respectively, for PacWest, as agreed by PacWest management and approved by
CUB management, and publicly available 2017 and 2018 EPS consensus "street estimates" of $1.75 and $2.09, respectively, for CUB, as
approved by CUB management, assumed long-term earnings growth rates provided by PacWest management, and pro forma assumptions
(including certain purchase accounting adjustments, cost savings and related expenses) provided by PacWest management, KBW analyzed
the potential financial impact of the merger on certain projected financial results of PacWest. This analysis indicated the merger could
increase assets by 15.9%, increase gross loans by 13.2%, increase deposits by 17.0%, increase Tangible Common Equity by 0.9%, be
accretive to PacWest's estimated post-closing 2018 EPS and estimated 2019 EPS and dilutive to PacWest's estimated tangible book value
per share as of December 31, 2017. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that each of PacWest's tangible common equity to tangible assets
ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio, leverage ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio as of December 31, 2017 could be lower on a pro
forma basis compared to PacWest on a standalone basis. For all of the above analysis, the actual results achieved by PacWest following the
merger may vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.

        CUB Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    KBW performed a discounted cash flow analysis of CUB to estimate a range for the implied
equity value of CUB. In this analysis, KBW used consensus "street estimates" of CUB for 2017 and 2018 EPS, which were $1.75 and
$2.09, respectively, which resulted in a calculation of net income of CUB for 2017 and 2018 of $31.2 million and $37.2 million,
respectively, which was used in KBW's analysis. CUB authorized KBW to use street estimates for EPS for 2017 and 2018 (and the
resultant calculated net income for such periods as discussed in the previous sentence) rather than CUB's internal estimates for EPS (and
net income) because CUB believed that the street estimates for EPS (and corresponding calculated net income) reflected a composite
analysis regarding interest rates and other economic assumptions resulting in a more objective view of CUB's projected

financial performance. Street estimates of EPS were higher than CUB's internal estimates. KBW also used an assumed long-term earnings
growth rate of 10.0% and a long-term asset growth rate of 9.0%, each as confirmed by CUB management, and used discount rates ranging
from 9.0% to 13.0% based on the capital asset pricing model and KBW's professional judgment. The ranges of values were derived by
adding (i) the present value of the estimated excess cash flows that CUB could generate over the five-year period from 2017 to 2021 as a
standalone company, and (ii) the present value of implied terminal value at the end of such period. KBW assumed that CUB would
maintain a tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio of 8.0% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level. In calculating
the terminal value of CUB, KBW applied a range of 14.0x to 18.0x to estimated 2022 earnings based on comparable companies and
KBW's professional judgment. This discounted cash flow analysis resulted in a range of implied values per CUB common share of $26.49
to $38.09.

        The discounted cash flow analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent
on the assumptions that must be made, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values, dividend payout rates and discount
rates. The foregoing discounted cash flow analyses did not purport to be indicative of the actual values of CUB.

        Miscellaneous.    KBW acted as financial advisor to CUB and did not act as an advisor to or agent of any other person. As part of its
investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in connection
with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, KBW has experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation of
banking enterprises. KBW and its affiliates, in the ordinary course of its and their respective broker-dealer businesses, and further to
certain existing sales and trading relationships with each of CUB and PacWest, may from time to time purchase securities from, and sell
securities to, CUB and PacWest. In addition, as a market maker in securities, KBW and its affiliates may from time to time have a long or
short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of CUB and PacWest for its and their own accounts and for the accounts of its
and their respective customers and clients.

        Pursuant to the KBW engagement agreement, CUB agreed to pay KBW a cash fee equal to 1.2% of the aggregate merger
consideration (referred to as the contingent fee), which is contingent upon the closing of the merger, as well as a separate fee of $750,000
(referred to as the opinion fee), which became payable to KBW concurrently with the rendering of its opinion; provided that the opinion
fee, to the extent then-previously paid to KBW, will be credited towards the contingent fee. CUB also agreed to reimburse KBW for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with its retention and to indemnify KBW against certain
liabilities relating to or arising out of KBW's engagement or KBW's role in connection therewith. Other than this present engagement,
during the two years preceding the date of its opinion, KBW has not provided investment banking and financial advisory services to CUB.
During the two years preceding the date of its opinion, KBW has not provided investment banking and financial advisory services to
PacWest. KBW may in the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to CUB or PacWest and receive
compensation for such services.

PacWest's Reasons for the Merger 

        In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, the PacWest board of directors consulted with PacWest senior management, as well as its financial and legal advisors, and
considered a number of factors, including the following material factors:

• each of PacWest's, CUB's and the combined company's business, operations, financial condition, asset quality, earnings and
prospects;

• the potential to grow core deposits and the improvement in PacWest's deposit and liquidity position by adding CUB's
strong deposit franchise and liquid balance sheet; 

• the opportunity to grow PacWest's presence in Southern California and complement PacWest's existing franchise by adding
CUB's leading commercial and industrial community banking business; 

• the cost savings available in the proposed transaction, as well as the potential for revenue enhancement, which create the
opportunity for PacWest to have greater future earnings and prospects compared to PacWest's earnings and prospects on a
stand-alone basis; 

• the potential risks associated with successfully integrating CUB's business, operations and workforce with those of
PacWest, and PacWest's past record of integrating acquisitions and realizing projected benefits of acquisitions; 

• its review and discussions with PacWest's management and advisors concerning the due diligence examination of CUB; 

• management's expectation that PacWest will continue to have a strong capital position upon completion of the transaction; 

• CUB's asset sensitive balance sheet, which will benefit PacWest in a rising rate environment; 

• its review with its legal advisor, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, of the merger agreement and other agreements, including the
provisions of the merger agreement designed to enhance the probability that the transaction will be completed; 

• the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of PacWest's business and towards
the completion of the merger and the integration of CUB; 

• the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the merger and the expected likelihood that such regulatory
approvals will be received in a reasonably timely manner and without the imposition of unacceptable conditions; and 

• the possibility of litigation challenging the merger, and PacWest's belief that any such litigation would be without merit.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the PacWest board of directors is not intended to be
exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the PacWest board of directors. In reaching its decision to approve the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the PacWest board of directors did not quantify
or assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The
PacWest board of directors considered all these factors as a whole, including discussions with, and questioning of, PacWest's senior
management and PacWest's advisors, and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to support its determination to approve
entering into the merger agreement.

        This explanation of PacWest's reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and
should be read in light of the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

        PacWest's board of directors realized that there can be no assurance about future results, including results expected or considered in
the factors listed above, such as assumptions regarding enhanced business prospects, anticipated cost savings and earnings
accretion/dilution. The PacWest board of directors concluded, however, that the potential positive factors outweighed the potential risks of
completing the transaction.

Management and Board of Directors of PacWest After the Merger 

        The directors and officers of PacWest immediately prior to the effective time will be the directors and officers of the surviving
corporation after the consummation of the merger, and will serve until such time as their successors are duly elected and qualified.

Interests of CUB Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

        In considering the recommendation of the CUB board of directors with respect to the merger, CUB shareholders should be aware that
certain of the directors and executive officers of CUB have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of CUB shareholders generally. The CUB board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other
matters, in approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and in making its recommendation that CUB
shareholders vote to approve the CUB merger proposal. These interests are described in further detail below.

Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards

        CUB Restricted Shares and CUB RSUs.    At the effective time, any vesting conditions applicable to each CUB restricted share and
CUB RSU will, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full and each such CUB restricted
share and CUB RSU will be converted into and exchanged for the merger consideration, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such vesting. The following table sets forth the dollar value of the CUB restricted shares that may become vested and the
CUB RSUs that may become vested or settled at the closing of the merger held by each CUB director and executive officer. For purposes
of calculating the value of the equity awards, we have assumed October 1, 2017 as the closing date of the merger and a merger
consideration equal to a price per CUB common share of $39.86 calculated by adding (i) the per share cash consideration, or $12.00, and
(ii) (x) the average closing price of PacWest common stock over the first

New Agreements with PacWest

Consulting Agreements

        In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, PacWest entered into consulting agreements with David I. Rainer,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CUB (which consulting agreement was subsequently amended), K. Brian Horton, President and
a director of CUB, and Karen A. Schoenbaum, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CUB, whereby PacWest will retain
these CUB executive officers as consultants to PacWest and its subsidiaries to perform certain services, including providing strategic
advice and counsel to PacWest and acting as an ambassador for PacWest in dealings with clients and counterparties. The consulting
agreements become effective as of, and are conditioned upon, the closing of the merger. If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to
its terms, the consulting agreements will also terminate and be of no force or effect. The term of the consulting agreements will end on the
earlier of (A)(1) 65 months from the closing of the merger, in the case of Mr. Rainer, or (2) the two-year anniversary of the closing of the
merger, in the case of Mr. Horton and Ms. Schoenbaum, and (B) the termination of the respective consulting agreement pursuant to its
terms.

        Pursuant to the consulting agreements, the executive officers have agreed not to, without the written consent of PacWest, directly or
indirectly, represent, become employed by, perform services for, consult to, or advise in any manner or have any material interest in any
"competitive enterprise" during the restricted period, which is the period from the effective date of the consulting agreement until its third
anniversary, in the case of Mr. Rainer, and its second anniversary, in the case of Mr. Horton and Ms. Schoenbaum. "Competitive
enterprise" is defined as any banking organization that competes where CUB or any of its subsidiaries regularly conducted business prior
to the closing of the merger, with any of the business activities engaged in by CUB or any of its subsidiaries any time prior to the closing
of the merger, or any entity or business attempting to acquire an interest in such banking organization.

        Pursuant to the consulting agreements, during the restricted period, the executive officers are also prohibited from, without the prior
written consent of PacWest, in any manner, directly or indirectly: (i) soliciting any client of CUB or any of its subsidiaries to transact
business with a competitive enterprise or to reduce or refrain from doing business with PacWest or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) interfering
with or damaging any client relationship of PacWest, Pacific Western Bank or CUB, and (iii) soliciting an employee of PacWest or any of
its subsidiaries to resign or to apply for or accept employment with a competitive enterprise.

        In addition, each of the executive officers agreed, pursuant to the terms of their respective consulting agreements, not to divulge trade
secrets and confidential information, knowledge or data of PacWest and its subsidiaries and their businesses and investments, obtained
during the executives' employment with CUB and during their consulting with PacWest.

        The executive officers will receive for their services following consummation of the merger, subject to complying with the non-
competition and non-solicitation restrictions and confidentiality provisions of the consulting agreements set forth above, the following
annual retainers: (1) $550,000 for Mr. Rainer, payable in substantially equal monthly installments during his 65-month consulting period
for a total of $3,000,000; (2) $375,000 for Mr. Horton, payable in equal monthly installments during his two-year consulting period for a
total of $750,000; and (3) $100,000 for Ms. Schoenbaum, payable in equal monthly installments during her two-year consulting period for
a total of $200,000. The consulting agreements also provide for reimbursement of each of the executive officer's reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, as well as office space at PacWest's Beverly Hills headquarters for Mr. Rainer.

        PacWest may terminate a consulting agreement for cause at any time by written notice to the relevant executive officer. "Cause" is
defined as (i) falsification of PacWest's documents or records; (ii) the executive officer's intentional and improper use or disclosure of
PacWest's confidential or proprietary information; (iii) any action by the executive officer which was intended to, and has a significant
detrimental effect on PacWest's reputation or business; (iv) the executive officer's willful failure to perform any reasonable assigned duties
after written notice from PacWest, and a reasonable opportunity to cure, such willful failure; (v) the executive officer's material breach of
any written agreement between the executive officer and PacWest or (vi) the executive officer's conviction for theft, dishonesty, or of any
criminal act which impairs the executive officer's ability to perform his or her duties with PacWest. Each of the executive officers may
terminate his or her consulting agreement for any reason, effective immediately. The consulting agreements provide that the fees payable
to the executive officers will not be paid for any period after termination by PacWest for cause, by the executive officer for any reason or
due to the executive officer's death or disability. If PacWest terminates a consulting agreement other than for cause prior to the end of the
term, PacWest will continue to pay the fees under the consulting agreement through the remainder of the term of the applicable consulting
agreement.

Indemnification and Insurance

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, following the effective time, PacWest has agreed to indemnify present and former
directors and officers of CUB in connection with any claim arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time to
the fullest extent permitted under law and to provide or purchase directors' and officers' liability insurance for a period of six years
following the effective time of the merger as described in "The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Directors' and Officers'
Insurance."

Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control

Change in Control Severance Plan

        The CU Bancorp 2012 Change in Control Severance Plan, referred to as the CIC Plan, provides for severance benefits to CUB's
executive officers upon termination of employment without cause or resignation for any reason within 24 months following a change in
control of CUB. As a condition of receiving the severance benefits under the CIC Plan, the applicable executive officer must execute a
release of claims. Specifically, each executive officer is entitled to the following severance benefits under the CIC Plan:

• A multiple of the executive officer's compensation as follows: three times, in the case of Mr. Rainer, and two times, in the
case of each of the other executive officers of CUB, the sum of (x) the base salary in effect on the date of the executive's
termination of employment and (y) the average of: (i) the bonus (which includes the value of cash and equity incentive
awards awarded to the executive officers under CUB's Management Incentive Plan) paid or payable for the most recently
completed full fiscal year performance period prior to the date of the executive's termination of employment, and (ii) the
bonus paid for the full fiscal year performance period completed immediately prior to the full fiscal year performance
period described in subsection (i) above, and 

• 24 months of reimbursement for any COBRA premiums paid for 24 months following termination.

        Any severance benefits under the CIC Plan that would constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Internal Revenue Code will be reduced in order to result in no portion of such payments being subject to the excise tax imposed by
Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, in certain circumstances
payments will be delayed for a period of six months following a participant's termination of employment. In such event, the severance
benefits will be contributed to a "rabbi trust" for the benefit of the participant and paid at the expiration of the six-month period.

        The following table sets forth the estimated value of the cash severance payments and COBRA premium payments to which CUB's
executive officers would be entitled pursuant to the CIC Plan, subject to execution of a release, based on compensation levels as of the

officers may differ from the amounts set forth below.

Executive Salary Continuation Agreements

        David I. Rainer, K. Brian Horton, Karen A. Schoenbaum, Anne A. Williams and Anita Y. Wolman, collectively, the CUB named
executive officers, have previously entered into salary continuation agreements, referred to as the SCAs, with CUB. The SCAs provide the
CUB named executive officers with an annual retirement benefit (payable in monthly installments) for 15 years (eight in the case of
Ms. Wolman plus two additional years for each year she continues in CUB's employ following attainment of age 65, up to a maximum of
15 years) following their retirement from CUB. All rights to the retirement benefits under the SCAs are currently vested for the CUB
named executive officers.

        In the event of a termination of employment within 24 months following a change in control of CUB, the CUB named executive
officers become entitled to receive the full retirement benefits that are payable under the SCAs at age 65, the specified normal retirement
age. The CUB named executive officers are entitled to a reduced retirement benefit if they leave CUB's employ prior to age 65. The SCAs
also provide a death benefit in the event a CUB named executive officer dies while employed by CUB or after becoming entitled to
receive benefits under the SCA.

        The following table sets forth the benefits that the CUB named executive officers would be entitled to receive, pursuant to the terms
of their salary continuation agreements, in the event of a termination of employment immediately following closing of the merger,

executive officers is limited to three times the average compensation paid to the executive officer during the five
years (or shorter period) prior to the change in control. Amounts above that limit will be offset against the cash
severance payable under the CIC Plan. As a result of such limit, the total cash severance payable to each of the
executive officers under the CIC Plan was reduced as follows: $32,657 for Mr. Rainer, $135,085 for Mr. Horton,
$673,529 for Ms. Schoenbaum, $219,246 for Mr. Sjogren, $0 for Ms. Williams and $0 for Ms. Wolman.

set forth below.

2017 Management Incentive Plan

        The CUB executive officers participate in the 2017 Management Incentive Plan, referred to as the MIP, which was approved by
CUB's Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and provides a set of goals and metrics for annual incentive
compensation to be paid to CUB's executive officers for 2017. Under the MIP, in the event of a change in control of CUB in 2017,
incentive performance award payments will be determined and payable based on the target levels for the cash incentive awards and equity
incentive awards. In order for an executive participating in the MIP to receive an incentive performance award following a change in
control, he or she must be employed by CUB on the day prior to the change in control. Cash incentive award payments will be paid on a
prorated basis, based on the number of days in 2017 prior to the change in control divided by 365. Equity incentive awards will be paid in
full, based on the target award level. PacWest has the discretion to deliver payment of the equity incentive awards in cash or unrestricted
stock.

        The following table sets forth the benefits that CUB's executive officers would be entitled to receive under the MIP in the event of
and assuming consummation of the merger on October 1, 2017. The actual amounts, if any, to be received by the executive officers may
differ from the amounts set forth below.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger 

        Completion of the merger and the bank merger by CUB is subject to the requirement that all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations required to be obtained prior to the effective time by either party or any of its respective subsidiaries from the
FRB, the FDIC and the CDBO which are necessary to consummate the merger and the bank merger, and any other consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations from any governmental authority the failure of which to be obtained is reasonably likely to have,

effect on PacWest (measured on a scale relative to CUB) or on CUB, have been made or obtained (as the case may be) and remain in full
force and effect and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof have expired.

        Completion of the merger and the bank merger by PacWest is subject to the requirement that all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations required to be obtained prior to the effective time by either party or any of its respective subsidiaries from the
FRB, the FDIC and the CDBO which are necessary to consummate the merger and the bank merger, and any other consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations from or with any governmental authority the failure of which to be obtained is reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on PacWest (measured on a scale relative to CUB) or on CUB, have been
made or obtained (as the case may be) and remain in full force and effect and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof have expired,
and none of such consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations contain any "materially burdensome regulatory condition."
The merger agreement defines a "materially burdensome regulatory condition" to mean any condition that would reasonably be likely
following the effective time to (i) have a material adverse effect with respect to either PacWest (measured on a scale relative to CUB) or
CUB, or (ii) require PacWest, Pacific Western Bank, the combined company or the surviving bank in the bank merger to raise additional
capital in an amount that would materially reduce the economic benefits of the merger to PacWest or the holders of PacWest common
stock (including the CUB shareholders in respect of the shares of PacWest common stock received by them in the merger).

        Notifications and/or applications requesting approval may also be submitted to various other federal and state regulatory authorities
and self-regulatory organizations.

        PacWest and CUB have agreed to cooperate and to use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, or in the case of
PacWest cause to be filed, all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third parties and/or governmental authorities in order to
consummate the merger, the bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. PacWest, CUB and/or
their respective subsidiaries have filed, or are in the process of filing, applications and notifications to obtain these regulatory approvals.

        Although the parties currently believe they should be able to obtain all required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, they cannot
be certain when or if they will obtain them or, if obtained, whether they will contain terms, conditions or restrictions not currently
contemplated that will be detrimental to PacWest after the completion of the merger or will contain a materially burdensome regulatory
condition.

Federal Reserve Board

        PacWest is a bank holding company as defined in the BHC Act. The primary regulator of PacWest is the FRB. PacWest has filed with
the FRB an application under Sections 3(a)(3) and 3(a)(5) of the BHC Act and regulations thereunder for the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement. In considering the approval of the merger, the FRB is required by the BHC Act to review, with respect to PacWest
and the companies and insured depository institution to be acquired: (1) the effect of the proposal on competition, (2) the financial
condition and future prospects of the combined company and the banks concerned and the managerial resources, including the
competence, experience, and integrity of the officers, directors and principal stockholders of PacWest, CUB and their subsidiary banks,
(3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the record of performance under the Community Reinvestment
Act of 1977 and the regulations issued thereunder, referred to as the CRA, (4) whether the merger is an interstate merger subject to the
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, referred to as the Riegle-Neal Act, (5) the banks' record of

compliance with the CRA, (6) the companies' effectiveness in combating money-laundering activities and (7) the risk to the stability of the
United States banking or financial system presented by the merger and the related transactions.

        In connection with its review of the application, the FRB will provide an opportunity for public comment on the application, and is
authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if it determines such meeting or other proceeding would be appropriate.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

        The prior approval of the FDIC will be required under Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, referred to as the Bank
Merger Act, to merge CU Bank with and into Pacific Western Bank. In evaluating an application filed under the Bank Merger Act, the
FDIC generally considers: (1) the competitive impact of the transaction, (2) financial and managerial resources of each bank that is a party
to the bank merger, (3) the extent to which the bank merger would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S.
banking or financial system, (4) the convenience and needs of the communities in which the banks serve, (5) whether the merger is subject
to the Riegle-Neal Act, (6) the performance records of the banks under the CRA, including their CRA rating and (7) each of the banks'
effectiveness in combating money-laundering activities and. In connection with its review under the Bank Merger Act, the FDIC will
provide an opportunity for public comment on the application for the bank merger, and is authorized to hold a public meeting or other
proceeding if it determines that would be appropriate.

        Transactions approved by the FRB or the FDIC generally may not be completed until 30 days after such approval is received, during
which time the Department of Justice, referred to as the DOJ, may challenge the transaction on antitrust grounds. With the approval of the
FRB or the FDIC, as the case may be, and the concurrence of the DOJ, the waiting period may be reduced to no less than 15 days. The
commencement of an antitrust action would stay the effectiveness of such an approval unless a court specifically ordered otherwise. In
reviewing the merger and the bank merger, the DOJ could analyze the merger's and the bank merger's effects on competition differently
than the FRB or the FDIC, and thus it is possible that the DOJ could reach a different conclusion regarding the merger's and the bank
merger's effects on competition. A determination by the DOJ not to object to the merger or the bank merger may not prevent the filing of
antitrust actions by private persons or state attorneys general.

California Department of Business Oversight

        The prior approval of the CDBO will be required under the California Financial Code to merge CU Bank with and into Pacific
Western Bank. In reviewing the merger of CU Bank with Pacific Western Bank, the CDBO will take competitive considerations into
account, as well as capital adequacy, quality of management and earnings prospects, in terms of both quality and quantity. The CDBO will
also take into account the record of performance of the banks concerned in meeting the credit needs of the entire community, including
low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, served by such companies and depository institutions. The CDBO will also take into account
the safety and soundness of the resulting bank following the bank merger. In considering the merger, the California Financial Code also
requires the CDBO to consider the fairness of the merger to all parties involved. Approval from the CDBO was received on June 27, 2017.

Additional Regulatory Approvals and Notices

        Notifications and/or applications requesting approval may be submitted to various other federal and state regulatory authorities and
self-regulatory organizations.

        Although PacWest and CUB expect to obtain the required regulatory approvals, there can be no assurances as to if, or when, these
regulatory approvals will be obtained, the terms and conditions on which the approvals may be granted, or whether there will be litigation
challenging such approvals. There can likewise be no assurances that U.S. or state regulatory authorities will not attempt to challenge the
merger on antitrust grounds or for other reasons, or, if such a challenge is made, as to the result of any such challenge.

Accounting Treatment 

        In accordance with current accounting guidance, PacWest, as the acquirer, will account for the merger using the acquisition method.
The acquisition method requires that (a) the recorded assets and liabilities of PacWest will be carried forward at their recorded amounts,
(b) PacWest's historical operating results will be unchanged for the prior periods being reported on, (c) the assets and liabilities of CUB
will be adjusted to fair value at the date of the merger and combined with the assets and liabilities of PacWest, and (d) the operating results
of CUB will be included in the operating results of PacWest beginning from the date of completion of the merger. In addition, all
identifiable intangible assets will be recorded at fair value and included as part of the assets acquired. The amount by which the purchase
price, consisting of the value of the cash and shares of PacWest common stock to be issued to former holders of CUB common shares,
CUB RSUs and CUB restricted shares and cash to be issued to former holders of CUB stock options, exceeds the fair value of the net
assets including identifiable intangible assets of CUB at the merger date will be reported as goodwill. In accordance with current
accounting guidance, goodwill is not amortized and will be evaluated for impairment annually. Identified intangible assets will be
amortized over their estimated lives.

Public Trading Markets 

        PacWest common stock is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "PACW" and CUB common shares are listed on NASDAQ under the
symbol "CUNB." Upon completion of the merger, CUB common shares will be delisted from NASDAQ and thereafter will be
deregistered under the Exchange Act. The PacWest common stock issuable in the merger will be listed on NASDAQ.

Exchange of Shares in the Merger 

        At or prior to the effective time, PacWest will appoint an exchange agent to handle the exchange of CUB common shares for shares of
PacWest common stock. Promptly after the effective time (and in any event within five business days), the exchange agent will send to
each holder of record of CUB common shares at the effective time (other than holders of excluded shares or dissenting shares) appropriate
transmittal materials and instructions for effecting the exchange of CUB common shares for the merger consideration the holder is entitled
to receive under the merger agreement. Upon surrender of certificates or book entry shares for cancellation along with the other documents
described in the instructions, a CUB shareholder will receive a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form, as applicable)
representing the number of whole shares of PacWest common stock that such holder is entitled to receive based on the exchange ratio of
0.5308 for each CUB common share and a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in the
merger agreement) of the cash consideration for the surrendered shares, and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares plus any unpaid
non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the merger
agreement. After the effective time, CUB will not register any transfers of CUB common shares.

Dissenters' Rights 

        CUB shareholders who vote their CUB common shares "AGAINST" the merger proposal and who properly demand the purchase of
such shares in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL will not be

converted into the right to receive the merger consideration otherwise payable for CUB common shares upon consummation of the merger,
but will instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due pursuant to Chapter 13 of CGCL.
A copy of Chapter 13 of the CGCL is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix C.

        The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to dissenters' rights under the CGCL. The full text of
Sections 1300 through 1313 of the CGCL is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Appendix C and is incorporated herein by
reference. Appendix C should be reviewed carefully by any CUB shareholder who wishes to exercise dissenters' rights or who wishes to
preserve the right to do so, since failure to comply with the procedures of the relevant statute in any respect will result in the loss of
dissenters' rights.

        All references in Sections 1300 through 1313 of the CGCL and in this summary to a "shareholder" are to the holder of record of CUB
common shares as to which dissenters' rights are asserted. A person having a beneficial interest in CUB common shares held of record in
the name of another person, such as a broker, bank or nominee, cannot enforce dissenters' rights directly and must act promptly to cause
the holder of record to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to perfect such person's dissenters' rights.

        ANY HOLDER OF CUB COMMON SHARES WISHING TO EXERCISE DISSENTERS' RIGHTS IS URGED TO
CONSULT LEGAL COUNSEL BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO EXERCISE SUCH RIGHTS. FAILURE TO COMPLY STRICTLY
WITH ALL OF THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN CHAPTER 13 OF THE CGCL, WHICH CONSISTS OF
SECTIONS 1300-1313, WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF A SHAREHOLDER'S STATUTORY DISSENTERS' RIGHTS.

        Under the CGCL, CUB common shares must satisfy each of the following requirements to qualify as dissenting shares, which are
referred to as dissenting shares:

• such dissenting shares must have been outstanding on the record date; 

• such dissenting shares must have voted "AGAINST" the merger proposal; 

• the holder of such dissenting shares must timely make a written demand that CUB repurchase such dissenting shares at fair
market value (as defined below); and 

• the holder of such dissenting shares must submit certificates representing such dissenting shares for endorsement (as
described below).

        A vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal does not in and of itself constitute a demand for appraisal under California law.

        Pursuant to Sections 1300 through 1313 of the CGCL, holders of dissenting shares may require CUB to repurchase their dissenting
shares at a price equal to the fair market value of such shares determined as of the day before the first announcement of the terms of the
merger, excluding any appreciation or depreciation as a consequence of the proposed merger, but adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock
split or stock dividend that becomes effective thereafter, referred to as the "fair market value."

        By no later than the date of the special meeting, CUB or its transfer agent must have received from any dissenting shareholder a
written demand that CUB repurchase such shareholder's dissenting shares. The written demand must include the number and class of
dissenting shares held of record by such dissenting shareholder that the dissenting shareholder demands that CUB purchase. Furthermore,
the written demand must include a statement of what such dissenting shareholder claims to be the fair market value of the dissenting
shares (which will constitute an offer by the dissenting shareholder to sell the dissenting shares at such price).

        Within 10 days following approval of the merger proposal by the CUB shareholders, CUB is required to mail a dissenter's notice to
each person who is entitled to dissenting shareholder rights. The dissenter's notice must contain the following:

• a notice of the approval of the merger proposal; 

• a statement of the price determined by CUB to represent the fair market value of dissenting shares (which will constitute an
offer by CUB to purchase such dissenting shares at such stated price unless such shares lose their status as "dissenting
shares" under Section 1309 of the CGCL); 

• a brief description of the procedure for such holders to exercise their rights as dissenting shareholders; and 

• a copy of Sections 1300 through 1304 of Chapter 13 of the CGCL.

        Within 30 days after the date on which the notice of the approval of the merger proposal by the outstanding shares is mailed to
dissenting shareholders, a dissenting shareholder must submit to CUB certificates representing any dissenting shares that the dissenting
shareholder demands CUB purchase, so that such dissenting shares may either be stamped or endorsed with the statement that the shares
are dissenting shares or exchanged for certificates of appropriate denomination so stamped or endorsed. If the dissenting shares are
uncertificated, then such shareholder must provide written notice of the number of shares which the shareholder demands that CUB
purchase within 30 days after the date of the mailing of the notice of the approval of the merger proposal. The demand, statement and CUB
certificates should be delivered to: CU Bancorp, 15821 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 100, Encino, California 91436, Attention: Corporate
Secretary.

        If upon the dissenting shareholder's surrender of the certificates representing the dissenting shares, CUB and a dissenting shareholder
agree upon the price to be paid for the dissenting shares and agree that such shares are dissenting shares, then the agreed price is required
by law to be paid (with interest thereon at the legal rate on judgments from the date of the agreement) to the dissenting shareholder within
the later of (i) 30 days after the date of such agreement or (ii) 30 days after any statutory or contractual conditions to the completion of the
merger are satisfied.

        If CUB and a dissenting shareholder disagree as to the price for such dissenting shares or disagree as to whether such shares are
entitled to be classified as dissenting shares, such holder has the right to bring an action in California Superior Court of the proper county,
within six months after the date on which the notice of the shareholders' approval of the merger proposal is mailed, to resolve such dispute.
In such action, the court will determine whether the CUB common shares held by such shareholder are dissenting shares and/or the fair
market value of such dissenting shares.

        In determining the fair market value for the dissenting shares, the court may appoint one or more impartial appraisers to make the
determination. Within a time fixed by the court, the appraisers, or a majority of them, will make and file a report with the court. If the
appraisers cannot determine the fair market value within 10 days of their appointment, or within a longer time determined by the court, or
the court does not confirm their report, then the court will determine the fair market value. Upon a motion made by any party, the report
will be submitted to the court and considered evidence as the court considers relevant. The costs of the dissenters' rights action, including
reasonable compensation to the appraisers appointed by the court, will be allocated between CUB and the dissenting shareholder(s) as the
court deems equitable. However, if the appraisal of the fair market value of CUB shares exceeds the price offered by CUB in the notice of
approval, then CUB will pay the costs. If the fair market value of the shares awarded by the court exceeds 125% of the price offered by
CUB, then the court may in its discretion impose additional costs on CUB, including attorneys' fees, fees of expert witnesses and interest.

        CUB shareholders considering whether to exercise dissenters' rights should consider that the fair market value of their CUB common
shares determined under Chapter 13 of the CGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of consideration to be paid in
connection with the merger, as set forth in the merger agreement. Also, CUB reserves the right to assert in any appraisal proceeding that,
for purposes thereof, the fair market value of dissenting shares is less than the value of the merger consideration to be issued and paid in
connection with the merger, as set forth in the merger agreement. CUB shareholders considering whether to exercise dissenters' rights
should consult with their tax advisors for the specific tax consequences of the exercise of dissenters' rights.

        Strict compliance with certain technical prerequisites is required to exercise dissenters' rights. CUB shareholders wishing to exercise
dissenters' rights should consult with their own legal counsel in connection with compliance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL. Any CUB
shareholder who fails to comply with the requirements of Chapter 13 of the CGCL, attached as Appendix C to this proxy
statement/prospectus, will forfeit the right to exercise dissenters' rights and will, instead, receive the consideration to be issued and paid in
connection with the merger, as set forth in the merger agreement.

        Except as expressly limited by Chapter 13 of the CGCL, dissenting shares continue to have all the rights and privileges incident to
their shares until the fair market value of their shares is agreed upon or determined.

        Dissenting shares lose their status as "dissenting shares," and holders of dissenting shares cease to be entitled to require CUB to
purchase such shares, upon the happening of any of the following:

• the merger is abandoned; 

• the dissenting shares are transferred before their submission to CUB for the required endorsement; 

• the dissenting shareholder and CUB do not agree on the status of the shares as dissenting shares or do not agree on the
purchase price, but neither CUB nor the shareholder files a complaint or intervenes in a pending action within six months
after CUB mails a notice that its shareholders have approved the merger; or

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following is a summary of selected provisions of the merger agreement. While PacWest and CUB believe this description covers
the material terms of the merger agreement, it may not contain all of the information that is important to you and is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the merger agreement, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety into, and is attached as Appendix A to, this
document. The parties urge you to read the merger agreement in its entirety.

Explanatory Note 

        The merger agreement and the summary of its terms in this document have been included only to provide you with information about
the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the merger agreement are
made by PacWest and CUB only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates and were qualified and subject to certain
limitations and exceptions agreed to by PacWest and CUB in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement. In particular,
in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary, it is important to
bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement and were
negotiated for the purpose of allocating contractual risk among the parties to the merger agreement rather than to establish matters as
facts. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject
to a contractual standard of materiality or material adverse effect different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports
and documents filed with the SEC, and, in some cases, they may be qualified by disclosures made by one party to the other, which are not
necessarily reflected in the merger agreement or other public disclosures made by PacWest or CUB. The representations and warranties
contained in the merger agreement do not survive the effective time. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations, warranties and covenants, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this document, may have changed since
the date of the merger agreement, and subsequent developments or new information may not be fully reflected in public disclosures of
PacWest or CUB.

        For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions should not be read
alone or relied upon as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of PacWest or CUB or any of their respective subsidiaries
or affiliates. Instead, such provisions or descriptions should be read only in conjunction with the other information provided elsewhere in
this document or incorporated by reference into this document. Please see the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."
PacWest and CUB will provide additional disclosures in their public reports to the extent they are aware of the existence of any material
facts that are required to be disclosed under federal securities laws and that might otherwise contradict the terms and information
contained in the merger agreement and will update such disclosure as required by federal securities laws.

The Merger 

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, CUB will merge with and into PacWest, with PacWest
surviving the merger. The separate corporate existence of CUB will cease, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, power and franchises.
The merger agreement also provides that immediately after the merger, CU Bank, a California state-chartered bank and a wholly owned
subsidiary of CUB, will merge with and into Pacific Western Bank, a California state-chartered bank and wholly owned subsidiary of
PacWest, with Pacific Western Bank as the surviving bank.

Effects of the Merger 

        As a result of the merger, there will no longer be any publicly held CUB common shares. CUB shareholders will only participate in
the surviving corporation's future earnings and potential growth

through their ownership of PacWest common stock. All of the other incidents of direct ownership of CUB common shares, such as the
right to vote on certain corporate decisions, to elect directors and to receive dividends and distributions from CUB, will be extinguished
upon completion of the merger. All of the property, rights, privileges and powers of PacWest and CUB will vest in the surviving
corporation, and all obligations, liabilities, debts, restrictions, disabilities and duties of PacWest and CUB will become the obligations,
liabilities, debts, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the surviving corporation.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger 

        The merger agreement provides that the merger will be consummated no later than three business days after the satisfaction or waiver
of all the closing conditions, except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing (but subject to the fulfillment
or waiver of those conditions), including the receipt of all regulatory and shareholder approvals and after the expiration of all regulatory
waiting periods, unless extended by mutual written agreement of PacWest and CUB. The merger will be consummated at the time the
certificate of merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the agreement of merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties and specified in the
Delaware certificate of merger and the California agreement of merger. The parties are seeking regulatory approval by the fourth quarter of
2017, with the consummation of the merger to occur as soon as practicable thereafter. However, there can be no assurance as to when or if
the merger will occur.

        If the merger is not completed by the end date, the merger agreement may be terminated by either PacWest or CUB, except to the
extent that the failure of the merger to be consummated by that date arises out of or results from the knowing action or inaction of the party
seeking to terminate which action or inaction is in violation of its obligations under the merger agreement.

        For a description of the transaction structure, merger consideration and treatment of CUB stock options, CUB restricted shares and
CUB RSUs, please see the section entitled "The Merger—Terms of the Merger."

PacWest's Governing Documents, Directors and Officers Following the Closing

        The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of PacWest will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation

law.

        The directors and officers of PacWest immediately prior to the effective time will be the directors and officers of the surviving

Merger Consideration; Exchange Procedures 

Conversion of CUB Common Shares

        At the effective time, each CUB common share, other than excluded shares and dissenting shares as described below, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into and become exchangeable for (i) $12.00 in cash and (ii) the right
to receive 0.5308 of a share of PacWest common stock as described under "The Merger—Merger Consideration," subject to

adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement and as further described below under "—Termination of the Merger Agreement."

Purchase of Outstanding CUB Series A Preferred Stock

        Prior to closing, PacWest and CUB will reasonably cooperate with respect to the purchase by CUB from the U.S. Treasury
Department of all of CUB's Series A preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury Department, and following CUB's Series A preferred stock
purchase (which will occur at or immediately prior to the closing), all of CUB's Series A preferred stock will be cancelled, and no payment
or distribution of merger consideration will be made in consideration therefor.

Cancellation of Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares

        At the effective time, (i) any CUB common shares held by PacWest or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of PacWest or
by CUB or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CUB, other than those held in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted, which are referred to as excluded shares, and (ii) any dissenting shares (subject to the procedures for dissenting
shares described herein) will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist and no consideration will be issued in exchange
therefor.

Dissenting Shares

        No later than 10 calendar days after CUB's shareholders approve the merger, CUB will provide each record holder of CUB common
shares entitled to vote on the merger with a notice including the information regarding dissenting shareholders' rights set forth in
Section 1301(a) of the CGCL.

        To the extent dissenters' rights under Section 1301(a) are applicable to the merger, no dissenting shares will be converted into or
represent a right to receive the consideration for such shares set forth in merger agreement. Instead, holders of dissenting shares will be
entitled to require CUB to purchase such shares for cash at their fair market value to the extent granted by Chapter 13 of the CGCL. If a
holder of dissenting shares thereafter effectively withdraws or loses such dissenters' rights with respect to such shares then, as of the
occurrence of such withdrawal or loss, each such share will be deemed as of the effective time to have been converted into and represent
only the right to receive the consideration for such shares set forth in the merger agreement.

        For more information regarding dissenters' rights, please see the section entitled "The Merger—Dissenters' Rights."

Rights as Shareholders of CUB

        At the effective time, holders of CUB common shares will cease to be, and will have no rights as, shareholders of CUB other than to
receive the merger consideration and any dividends or distributions to which they are entitled under the merger agreement.

Effect of Merger on CUB Stock Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs

        For a description of the treatment of CUB stock options, CUB restricted shares and CUB RSUs in the merger, see the section entitled
"The Merger—Treatment of CUB Stock Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs."

Exchange Procedures

        Immediately prior to the effective time, PacWest will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with an exchange agent selected by PacWest
with CUB's prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (i) an amount of cash equal to $12.00 multiplied by
the number of CUB shares

(other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, plus any cash due in lieu of
fractional shares, and (ii) certificates, or evidence of shares in book-entry form, representing the shares of PacWest common stock to be
exchanged for CUB common shares in the merger. Promptly after the effective time (and in any event within five business days), the
exchange agent will provide appropriate transmittal materials to holders of record of CUB common shares, advising such holders of the
procedure for surrendering their shares to the exchange agent.

        Upon the surrender of CUB common shares (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), the holder will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor:

• a number of whole shares of PacWest common stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the merger
agreement, as described in "—Conversion of CUB Common Shares" above, evidenced by a stock certificate or in book-
entry form; and 

• a check in the amount of the cash consideration for the surrendered shares and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
plus any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the merger agreement.

Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares

        All shares of PacWest common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger will be deemed issued and outstanding as of the effective
time and if a dividend or other distribution is declared by PacWest in respect of the PacWest common stock, the record date for which is at
or after the effective time, that declaration will include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to the
merger agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of PacWest common stock will be paid to any holder of any
unsurrendered certificate or book-entry shares representing CUB common shares until such certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or book-entry shares are surrendered for exchange in accordance with the merger agreement. Subject to applicable laws, following
surrender of any such certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided) or book-entry shares, there will be issued and/or paid to
the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of PacWest common stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the
time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time theretofore payable with respect to
such whole shares of PacWest common stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such whole shares of PacWest common stock with a record date after the effective time but with a payment date
subsequent to surrender.

Fractional Shares of PacWest Common Stock

        No fractional shares of PacWest common stock will be issued to any shareholder of CUB upon completion of the merger. For each
fractional share that would otherwise be issued, PacWest will pay cash in an amount equal to the fraction of a share of PacWest common
stock which the holder would otherwise be entitled to receive multiplied by the PacWest average closing price. No interest will be paid or
accrue on cash payable to holders in lieu of fractional shares.

material adverse effect has occurred:

• any change in law or GAAP or interpretations thereof (except to the extent that such effect, circumstance, occurrence or
change disproportionately adversely affects CUB and its subsidiaries or PacWest and its subsidiaries, as the case may be,
compared to other companies of similar size and operating in the commercial banking industry in which such party
operates, in which case only the disproportionate effect will be taken into account);

• any change in market price or trading volume of CUB common shares or PacWest common stock (except that the facts or
circumstances giving rise or contributing to such change may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been, a material adverse effect, except to the extent such facts or circumstances are
themselves excepted from the definition of material adverse effect pursuant to any other clause of the definition); 

• any action taken by either party with the other party's express written consent or any action taken by either party that such
party was expressly required to take pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, including, in the case of CUB, the

• changes in economic conditions affecting commercial banks generally (except to the extent that such change in economic
conditions disproportionately adversely affects CUB and its subsidiaries or PacWest and its subsidiaries, as the case may
be, compared to other companies of similar size and operating in the commercial banking industry in which such party
operates, in which case only the disproportionate effect will be taken into account;

party since the date of the merger agreement, those matters disclosed in the PacWest disclosure schedules and CUB
disclosure schedules, respectively, in each case, consistent with the standard set forth in the merger agreement and based on
the information on those matters made available on or prior to the date of the merger agreement (except to the extent of any
adverse developments with respect to such matters arising after the date of the merger agreement); or 

• changes in relationships with customers or employees of the respective parties and their respective subsidiaries that were
primarily the result of the announcement or public disclosure of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated

        The representations and warranties in the merger agreement do not survive the effective time and, as described below under the
section entitled "Termination of the Merger Agreement," if the merger agreement is validly terminated, there will be no liability or
damages arising under the representations and warranties of PacWest or CUB, or otherwise under the merger agreement, unless PacWest
or CUB willfully and intentionally breached the merger agreement.

agents, and subject to the covenants relating to regulatory applications, as described under "Regulatory Matters" below, CUB and its
subsidiaries will take no action that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or materially delay CUB's ability to obtain any
necessary approvals of any regulatory authorities or other governmental authority required for the transactions contemplated by the merger

the merger agreement on a timely basis.

        In addition to the general covenants above, CUB has agreed that until the effective time, except as otherwise expressly required by

PacWest Forbearance 

        PacWest has agreed as to itself and its subsidiaries that, prior to the effective time (unless CUB shall otherwise approve in writing,
and except as otherwise expressly contemplated by the merger agreement or as set forth in PacWest's disclosure schedules) and except as
required by applicable law, it will not and will cause each of its subsidiaries not to:

Adverse Actions

• take any action or omit to take any action that is intended to or would reasonably be likely to result in (i) any of PacWest's
representations and warranties set forth in the merger agreement being or becoming untrue in any material respect at any
time at or prior to the effective time, (ii) any of the conditions to the merger not being satisfied, (iii) the merger being
prevented or impeded from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code;
or (iv) a material violation of any provision of the merger agreement, except as may be required by applicable law;

Governing Documents

• amend PacWest's charter or bylaws, or the organizational documents of any of its subsidiaries, in each case in a manner that
would adversely affect the holders of CUB common shares relative to and disproportionately to all other holders of
PacWest common stock; or

Commitments

• enter into any contract with respect to, or otherwise agree or commit to do, any of the foregoing.

Regulatory Matters 

        PacWest and CUB have agreed to prepare and file this document, and PacWest has agreed to prepare and file with the SEC the
registration statement on Form S-4 in connection with the issuance of shares of PacWest common stock in the merger, as promptly as
practicable, of which this document is a part. Each party has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 registration statement
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing.

        PacWest and CUB have agreed to cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, or in the case of
PacWest cause to be filed, all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third parties and/or governmental authorities in order to
consummate the merger, the bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Nothing contained in the merger agreement will be deemed to require PacWest to take any action, or commit to take any action, or
agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
governmental authorities that would reasonably be likely to be a materially burdensome regulatory condition.

Shareholder Approval 

        CUB has agreed to convene a meeting of its shareholders as soon as practicable after the S-4 registration statement is declared
effective, and will in any event use reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting no later than 55 calendar days after the S-4 registration
statement is declared effective, to consider and vote upon the approval of the principal terms of the merger agreement. Subject to certain
limited exceptions, the CUB board of directors will recommend to CUB shareholders that they approve

the principal terms of the merger agreement. Unless the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, CUB will convene
such meeting regardless of whether or not (i) the CUB board of directors has changed its recommendation that CUB shareholders approve
the principal terms of the merger agreement or (ii) an acquisition proposal from a third party has been made (discussed in more detail
below).

Bank Merger 

        PacWest and CUB have agreed that, immediately after the merger, CU Bank will merge with and into Pacific Western Bank, with
Pacific Western Bank as the surviving entity.

NASDAQ Listing 

        PacWest has agreed to file with NASDAQ any required notices or forms with respect to the shares of PacWest common stock to be
issued in the merger.

Employee Matters 

        For a period of one year following closing, PacWest will provide, or cause to be provided, to each of the employees of CUB and its
subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the effective time who continue employment with PacWest or any of its subsidiaries with a base
salary or base wage, cash incentive opportunities and pension and welfare opportunities (excluding equity and long term incentive
compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those that are generally made available to similarly situated employees
of PacWest and its subsidiaries.

        PacWest has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to give CUB employees full credit for their service with CUB for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and determination of the level of benefits under any employee benefit plans that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the closing to the same extent recognized by CUB immediately prior to the closing,
except to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service and other than (i) for benefit accrual
purposes under any defined benefit pension plan and (ii) for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits.

        PacWest has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods (to the extent such conditions or waiting periods were covered or satisfied under the applicable plans of CUB) with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the CUB employees under any life, disability, medical, dental or health plans that
such employees may be eligible to participate in after the closing, and provide each CUB employee with full credit under medical, dental
and health plans for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to
such employee's participation in any life, disability, medical, dental or health plans of PacWest after the closing.

Indemnification and Directors' and Officers' Insurance 

        PacWest has agreed to, following the effective time, indemnify present and former directors and officers of CUB in connection with
any claim arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time to the fullest extent permitted under law.

        For a period of six years from the effective time, PacWest has agreed to provide the portion of directors and officers liability
insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former directors and officers of CUB on terms and conditions no less advantageous to
such officers and directors than those provided by CUB; provided, however, that PacWest is not required to spend more than 250% of the
current annual amount spent by CUB to procure such insurance coverage. In lieu thereof, PacWest or,

Table of Contents

with the prior written consent of PacWest, CUB may purchase a six-year tail policy subject to the limitation on cost described in the
preceding sentence.

Acquisition Proposals 

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, CUB has agreed that neither it nor its subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees and affiliates will, and that CUB will direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries' agents
and representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

• initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to any
acquisition proposal; or 

• engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with any
person relating to an acquisition proposal or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an acquisition
proposal.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "acquisition proposal" means:

• any proposal, offer or inquiry with respect to a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving CUB
or any of its subsidiaries that if consummated would result in any person (or such person's shareholders) owning 15% or
more of the total voting power of CUB or the surviving entity in a merger involving CUB or the resulting parent company;
and 

• any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the total voting power of any class of
equity securities of CUB or those of any of its subsidiaries or 15% or more of CUB's consolidated total assets.

        However, the above restriction would not prevent CUB or its board of directors from:

• complying with Rule 14d-9 and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act; 

• at any time before, but not after the CUB shareholder approval is obtained, providing information in response to a request
therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal if CUB receives from the person
so requesting such information, an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other party than
those contained in the confidentiality agreement between PacWest and CUB; or 

• engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition
proposal;

        only if, however, in the cases referred to in the second and third bullet points above, the CUB board of directors determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to violate the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Further, the merger agreement provides that the CUB board of directors and each committee thereof will not:

• except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or
resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to PacWest, the recommendation of its board of
directors that its shareholders approve the principal terms of the merger agreement; or

Table of Contents

• cause or permit CUB to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to above) relating to any
acquisition proposal.

        Notwithstanding the above, prior to the time the CUB shareholder approval is obtained, the CUB board of directors may withhold,
withdraw or adversely modify the recommendation of its board of directors or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any
superior proposal (as defined below) made to CUB after the date of the merger agreement that was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or
facilitated in breach of the merger agreement, if (A) an unsolicited bona fide written offer is made to CUB and is not withdrawn and the
CUB board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such acquisition proposal is a superior
proposal, and (B) the CUB board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such
action would result in a violation of the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, however, that no such change of
recommendation may be made until after (I) at least five business days following PacWest's receipt of notice from CUB advising that the
CUB board of directors intends to take such action and the basis therefor, and (II) CUB has negotiated in good faith to permit PacWest to
modify the merger agreement during such five business day period. In determining whether to make a change of recommendation, the
CUB board of directors will take into account any changes to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by PacWest and any other
information provided by PacWest in response to such notice.

        As used in the merger agreement, "superior proposal" means an unsolicited bona fide acquisition proposal (provided that for purposes
of the definition of "superior proposal" the references to "15%" in the definition of "acquisition proposal" will instead refer to "50%") that
the CUB board of directors has determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms,
taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, and if consummated,
would result in a transaction more favorable to CUB shareholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by the
merger agreement.

Trust Preferred Securities; Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings 

        The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time, PacWest will assume the performance of the indentures and guarantee
agreements relating to the trust capital securities issued by various trust business subsidiaries of CUB and the payment of the principal of
and premium, if any, and interest thereon. CUB will also cooperate with PacWest to effect the discharge of CUB's borrowings from the
Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.

Series A Preferred Stock Purchase 

        The merger agreement provides that, prior to the effective time, CUB and PacWest will use reasonable best efforts to facilitate the
purchase by CUB from the U.S. Treasury Department of all of CUB's Series A preferred stock held by the U.S. Treasury Department.

Conditions to Consummation of the Merger 

        The respective obligation of each party to effect the merger is subject to the satisfaction or written waiver at or prior to the effective
time of each of the following conditions:

• CUB having obtained the CUB shareholder approval; 

• no governmental authority of competent jurisdiction having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law

governmental authority the failure of which to be obtained is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on CUB or PacWest (measured on a scale relative to CUB), having been made or obtained (as the
case may be) and remaining in full force and effect and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof having expired; 

• since April 5, 2017, no event having occurred or circumstance arisen that, individually or taken together with all other

standards set forth in the merger agreement, as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing date of the merger

• at any time prior to the effective time, whether before or after the CUB shareholder approval, by action of either party's
board of directors if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the other
party, such that if continuing on the closing date of the merger, the condition as to the accuracy of the representations and
warranties or the compliance with covenants by the other party would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not
curable or, if curable, is not cured within 30 calendar days after written notice thereof is given by the terminating party (or
such shorter period as remaining prior to the end date); provided, that the terminating party is not then in material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement; 

• by action of PacWest's board of directors at any time prior to the CUB shareholder approval, in the event: 

• CUB has breached in any material respect the prohibitions in the merger agreement relating to acquisition
proposals; 

• the CUB board of directors has effected a change of recommendation; 

• at any time after the end of 10 business days following receipt of an acquisition proposal, the CUB board of

merger agreement as promptly as practicable (but in any event within five business days) after receipt of any
written request to do so by PacWest; or 

• a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding CUB common shares has been publicly disclosed (other than by
PacWest or an affiliate of PacWest) and the CUB board of directors recommends that CUB shareholders tender
their shares in such tender or exchange offer or, within 10 business days after the commencement of such tender or

dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between

• the quotient of the PacWest average closing price divided by $52.75 is less than (i) the quotient of the average price
of the KBW Index during the determination period divided by the index ratio, minus (ii) 0.15.

If CUB elects to terminate the merger agreement and provides written notice thereof to PacWest, then within two business
days following PacWest's receipt of such notice, PacWest may elect to reinstate the merger and related transactions, and
adjust the exchange ratio to equal the lesser of (i) the quotient of $23.80 divided by the PacWest average closing price and
(ii) (a) the quotient of $23.80 divided by the PacWest average closing price (b) multiplied by the index ratio. Alternatively,
PacWest may elect not to adjust the exchange ratio, and, in lieu thereof, may increase the cash consideration per CUB
common share such that the value of the total consideration received for each share is the same as if the exchange ratio had
been adjusted as described above.

definition of the term "acquisition proposal" will instead refer to "50%").

Waiver and Amendment of the Merger Agreement 

        Prior to the effective time, any provision of the merger agreement may be: (i) waived in whole or in part by the party benefited by the
provision or by both parties; or (ii) amended or modified at any time, by an agreement in writing between the parties thereto executed in
the same manner as the merger agreement, except that after the CUB shareholder approval is obtained, the merger agreement may not be
amended if it would reduce the aggregate value of the consideration to be received by CUB shareholders in the merger without any
subsequent approval by such shareholders or be in violation of applicable law.

Expenses 

        The merger agreement provides that all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement, the merger, and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party incurring such expense.

Voting Agreements 

        Each of the directors of CUB, in his or her capacity as a shareholder of CUB, has entered into a voting agreement with PacWest in
which such director has agreed to vote all CUB common shares that he or she owns and has the power to vote in favor of the merger
proposal and any other matter that is required to be approved by the shareholders of CUB to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement. The directors also agreed to vote against any proposal made in opposition to the approval of the principal terms of the
merger agreement or in competition with the merger agreement and against any acquisition proposal. As of the close of business on the
record date, CUB's directors beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 1,095,309 CUB common shares, allowing them to exercise
approximately 6.14% of the voting power of CUB common shares (which does not include shares issuable upon the exercise of stock
options or upon the vesting of CUB RSUs that were not outstanding as of the close of business on the record date).

        In addition, each shareholder who executed a voting agreement agreed not to (i) offer for sale, sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber,
assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to, or consent to the
offer for sale, sale, transfer, tender, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of any CUB common shares or (ii) enter into any
voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement, voting trust or otherwise, with respect to any of their CUB common shares, and
not commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions, subject in each case to certain limited exceptions.

        The voting agreements terminate in certain circumstances, including in the event that the merger agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

LITIGATION RELATED TO THE MERGER 

        Two putative shareholder class action lawsuits have been filed in connection with the merger agreement. The Parshall complaint was
filed on June 9, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The Parshall complaint alleges that the
members of the CUB board of directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, based upon alleged omissions and
misrepresentations in the initial registration statement, by approving the proposed merger for inadequate consideration and by entering into
the merger agreement containing preclusive deal protection devices.,. The plaintiff in this action seeks injunctive relief prohibiting
consummation of the merger, rescission and damages in the event the merger is consummated, an accounting of damages suffered by the
plaintiff and the putative class, attorneys' fees and costs and other and further relief.

        The Klein complaint was filed on June 12, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The Klein
complaint alleges that the members of the CUB board of directors violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, based upon
alleged omissions and misrepresentations in the initial registration statement, by approving the proposed merger for inadequate
consideration and by entering into the merger agreement containing preclusive deal protection devices. The plaintiff in this action seeks
injunctive relief prohibiting consummation of the merger, rescission and damages in the event the merger is consummated, an accounting
of damages suffered by the plaintiff and the putative class, attorneys' fees and costs and other and further relief.

        At this stage, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the proceedings in the merger related litigation or their impact on CUB,
PacWest or the merger.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER 

        This section describes the material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of
CUB common shares.

        For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of CUB common shares who for United States federal income tax
purposes is:

• a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• a corporation (or an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes), created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States or any state or political subdivision thereof; 

• a trust that (1) is subject to (A) the primary supervision of a court within the United States and (B) the authority of one or
more United States persons to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under
applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person; or 

• an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.

        If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds CUB
common shares, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding CUB common shares, you should consult your tax advisor about the tax
consequences of the merger to you.

        This discussion applies only to those CUB shareholders who hold their CUB common shares as a capital asset within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code, and does not address all the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to
particular U.S. holders in light of their individual circumstances or to CUB shareholders that are subject to special rules, such as:

• financial institutions; 

• investors in pass-through entities; 

• insurance companies; 

• tax-exempt organizations; 

• dealers in securities or currencies; 

• traders in securities that elect to use a mark to market method of accounting; 

• persons that hold CUB common shares as part of a straddle, hedge, constructive sale or conversion transaction; 

• regulated investment companies; 

• real estate investment trusts; 

• certain expatriates or persons that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; 

• persons who are not U.S. holders; 

• shareholders who exercise dissenters' rights; and 

• shareholders who acquired their CUB common shares through the exercise of a CUB stock option, a CUB restricted share
award or a CUB RSU or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan.

        In addition, the discussion does not address any alternative minimum tax or any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the
merger, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care
and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

        The following discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder
and published rulings and decisions, all as currently in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the continuing validity of this discussion.

        PacWest and CUB have structured the merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code. The obligation of PacWest to complete the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from Sullivan &
Cromwell LLP, counsel to PacWest, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code. The obligation of CUB to complete the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from Manatt,
Phelps & Phillips, LLP, counsel to CUB, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code. These opinions will be based on assumptions, representations, warranties and covenants, including those
contained in the merger agreement and in tax representation letters provided by PacWest and CUB. The accuracy of such assumptions,
representations and warranties, and compliance with such covenants, could affect the conclusions set forth in such opinions. None of these
opinions is binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts. PacWest and CUB have not requested and do not intend to request any
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Accordingly, each CUB
shareholder should consult its tax advisor with respect to the particular tax consequences of the merger to such holder.

Tax Consequences of the Merger Generally to Holders of CUB Common Shares

        In the opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP, the merger will qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and as a result:

• A CUB holder who receives PacWest common stock and cash (other than cash received in lieu of a fractional share of
PacWest common stock) in exchange for CUB common shares pursuant to the merger, will generally recognize gain (but
not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of gain realized (i.e., the excess of the sum of the amount of
cash and the fair market value of the PacWest common stock received pursuant to the merger over such holder's adjusted
tax basis in the CUB common shares surrendered in the exchange) and (2) the amount of cash received pursuant to the
merger (excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of PacWest common stock); 

• The aggregate tax basis in the PacWest common stock received by a holder of CUB common shares in the merger,
including any fractional share interests deemed received and redeemed (as described below), will equal such holder's
aggregate adjusted tax basis in the CUB common shares surrendered in the exchange, reduced by the amount of cash
received (excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share) and increased by the amount of gain, if any, recognized
by such holder (excluding any gain recognized with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share) on the exchange;
and 

• the holding period of PacWest common stock received in exchange for CUB common shares will include the holding
period of the CUB common shares for which it is exchanged.

        If U.S. holders of CUB common shares acquired different blocks of shares of CUB common shares at different times or at different
prices, such holders' basis and holding period may be

Table of Contents

determined with reference to each block of CUB common shares. Any such holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the manner
in which PacWest common stock received in the exchange should be allocated among different blocks of CUB common shares and with
respect to identifying the bases or holding periods of the particular shares of PacWest common stock received in the merger.

Cash Received In Lieu of a Fractional Share of PacWest Common Stock

        A CUB shareholder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of PacWest common stock will be treated as having received the
fractional share pursuant to the merger and then as having exchanged the fractional share for cash in a redemption by PacWest. As a result,
a CUB shareholder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the basis in his or
her fractional share interest as set forth above. This gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or
loss if, as of the effective date of the merger, the holding period for such shares is greater than one year. The deductibility of capital losses
is subject to limitations.

        The preceding discussion is intended only as a summary of material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger. It
is not a complete analysis or discussion of all potential tax effects that may be important to you. Thus, you are strongly encouraged to
consult your tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences resulting from the merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the
applicability and effect of federal, state, local, and other tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in the tax laws.

COMPARISON OF SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS 

General 

        CUB is incorporated under the laws of the State of California, and the rights of CUB shareholders are governed by the laws of the
State of California, CUB's articles of incorporation and CUB's bylaws. As a result of the merger, CUB shareholders will receive shares of
PacWest common stock and will become PacWest stockholders. PacWest is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the
rights of PacWest stockholders are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, PacWest's certificate of incorporation and PacWest's
bylaws. Thus, following the merger, the rights of CUB shareholders who become PacWest stockholders in the merger will no longer be
governed by the laws of the State of California and CUB's articles of incorporation and bylaws and instead will be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware and PacWest's certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

Comparison of Stockholders' Rights 

        Set forth below is a summary comparison of material differences between the rights of CUB shareholders under California law and
CUB's articles of incorporation and bylaws (left column) and the rights of PacWest stockholders under Delaware law and PacWest's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (right column). While the parties believe that the summary table includes the material differences
between the rights of CUB's shareholders and those of PacWest's stockholders, this summary does not include a complete description of all
the differences between the rights of the stockholders. Copies of the full text of PacWest's certificate of incorporation and bylaws currently
in effect, and CUB's articles of incorporation and bylaws currently in effect, are available, without charge, by following the instructions in
the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."

CUB  PacWest
Authorized Capital Stock

CUB's articles of incorporation state that the authorized capital
stock of CUB consists of 75 million common shares, no par value
per share, and 50 million preferred shares, no par value per share.
As of June 30, 2017, there were 17,831,131 common shares
issued and outstanding and 16,400 shares of Series A preferred
stock issued and outstanding, which preferred stock CUB intends
to repurchase and cancel prior to the effective time.

 PacWest's certificate of incorporation states that the authorized
capital stock of PacWest consists of 200 million shares of
common stock and 5 million shares of preferred stock. As of
June 30, 2017, there were 121,448,321 shares of PacWest
common stock outstanding and no shares of PacWest preferred
stock outstanding.

CUB  PacWest
Number of Directors

CUB's bylaws state that the number of directors that may serve on
CUB's board of directors cannot be less than nine nor more than
17. The number of directors may be changed, or a definite number
may be fixed without provisions for an indefinite number, by a
duly adopted amendment to the articles of incorporation or by an
amendment to the applicable bylaw provision adopted by the vote
or written consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled
to vote. However, an amendment reducing the fixed number or the
minimum number of directors to a number less than five cannot be
adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a meeting, or the
shares not consenting in the case of an action by written consent,
are equal to more than 162/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote thereon. There are currently 12 members of the CUB board
of directors.

 PacWest's bylaws state that the number of directors comprising
the board of directors will be from seven to 15, with the exact
number to be determined from time to time by the PacWest board
of directors. There are currently 12 members of the PacWest board
of directors. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the directors of
PacWest immediately prior to the effective time will be the
directors of PacWest following the merger.

CUB  PacWest
Election of Directors

CUB's bylaws provide that CUB shareholders may cumulate votes
with respect to the election of directors at a shareholders' meeting
for any candidate or candidates' whose names have been placed in
nomination prior to the voting if the shareholder has given notice
prior to the voting of the shareholder's intention to cumulate votes.
If any shareholder has given such notice, then every shareholder
entitled to vote may cumulate such shareholder's votes for
candidates in nomination and give one candidate a number of
votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by
the number of votes to which such shareholder's shares are
entitled, or distribute the shareholder's votes on the same principle
among any or all of the candidates, as the shareholder thinks fit.
The candidates receiving the highest number of votes up to the
number of directors to be elected are elected.

 PacWest's certificate of incorporation provides that each
stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by
such stockholder. Cumulative voting is permitted so long as the
name of the candidates for whom such votes would be cast has
been placed in nomination prior to the voting and at least one
stockholder has given notice at the meeting prior to the voting of
such stockholder's intention to cumulate votes. Cumulative voting
provides each stockholder with a number of votes equal to the
number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of
shares of common stock held by such stockholder, which such
stockholder can then vote in favor of one or more nominees.

PacWest's bylaws provide that directors will be elected by the vote
of the majority of the votes cast (meaning the number of shares
voted "for" a nominee must exceed the number of shares voted
"against" such nominee) at any meeting for the election of
directors at which a quorum is present, provided that the directors
will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast (instead of by votes
cast for or against a nominee) at any meeting at which a quorum is
present for which (i) the secretary of PacWest receives a notice
pursuant to PacWest's bylaws that a stockholder intends to
nominate a director or directors and (ii) such proposed nomination
has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or prior to the
tenth day preceding the date PacWest first mails its notice of
meeting for such meeting to the stockholders.

Removal of Directors

Under CUB's bylaws, any or all of the directors may be removed
without cause if such removal is approved by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. However,
no director may be removed (unless the entire board of directors is
removed) when the votes cast against removal would be sufficient
to elect such director if voted cumulatively at an election at which
the same total number of votes were cast and the entire number of
directors authorized at the time of the director's most recent
election were then being elected.

 Under PacWest's bylaws, any director may be removed, with or
without cause, at any meeting of stockholders called expressly for
such purpose by a vote of the holders of a majority of shares
entitled to vote for the election of directors. However, if the
certificate of incorporation provides for cumulative voting (as it
currently does) and less than the entire board of directors is to be
removed, then no director may be removed without cause if the
votes cast against his or her removal would be sufficient to elect
him or her if then cumulatively voted at an election of directors.

CUB  PacWest
Filling Vacancies on the Board of Directors

CUB's bylaws provide that vacancies on the board of directors
may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, though less
than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. However, a
vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written
consent of the shareholders or by court order may be filled only
by approval of the shareholders. Each director so elected will hold
office until the expiration of the term of the director which such
director replaced.

 PacWest's bylaws provide that vacancies and newly created
directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number
of directors may be filled by the vote of a majority of the directors
then in office, though less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining
director. Any director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy will
hold office until the expiration of the term of the director which
such director replaced.

Nomination of Director Candidates by Stockholders

CUB's bylaws provide that any shareholder of any outstanding
class of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote for the
election of directors may nominate candidates to become
members of the board of directors. Notice of the shareholder's
intention to make any nominations must be made in writing and
delivered or mailed to the president or the chief executive officer
of CUB no more than 60 days prior to any meeting of
shareholders called for the election of directors and no more than
10 days after the date the notice of such meeting is sent to
shareholders. However, if notice of such meeting is sent to
shareholders, such notice of intention to nominate must be
received by the president or chief executive officer of CUB not
later than the time fixed for the opening of the meeting.

 PacWest's bylaws permit stockholders who are entitled to vote in
the meeting of stockholders and who are stockholders of record at
the time notice is delivered to the corporate secretary of PacWest
to nominate a director for election if notice is delivered to the
corporate secretary not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior
to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the
preceding year, with the notice period varying for certain
instances as set forth in the bylaws.

Stockholder Proposals

CUB's articles of incorporation and bylaws do not provide a
procedure whereby shareholders may bring proposals before
CUB's annual meeting.

 PacWest's bylaws provide that in order for a proposal to be
brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the
stockholder must give notice of the proposal to the secretary not
less than 90 days and not more than 120 days prior to the first
anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year,
with the notice period varying for certain instances as set forth in
the bylaws.

CUB  PacWest
Stockholder Action Without a Meeting

CUB's bylaws provide that any action that may be taken at any
annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a
meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting
forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding
shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

In the case of election of directors, such consent will be effective
only if signed by the holders of all outstanding shares entitled to
vote for the election of directors.

 According to PacWest's bylaws, any action required or permitted
to be taken at any annual or special stockholders' meeting may be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote,
if a consent in writing is delivered to PacWest, setting forth the
action to be taken, and is signed by the number of stockholders
whose affirmative vote would be required to take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted.

Special Meetings of Stockholders

According to CUB's bylaws, a special meeting of the
shareholders, for any purpose or purposes whatsoever, may be
called at any time by the board of directors, or by the chairman of
the board of directors, or by the president, or by one or more
shareholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not
less than 10% of the votes at any such meeting.

 According to PacWest's bylaws, PacWest may call a special
stockholders meeting upon the written request of the board of
directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief
executive officer or the vice chairman of the board of directors, or
at the request of PacWest stockholders who together hold not less
than 10% of the outstanding shares of PacWest stock that would
be entitled to vote at such a meeting.

CUB  PacWest
Indemnification of Directors and Officers

Pursuant to CUB's articles of incorporation, the liability of
directors for monetary damages is eliminated to the fullest extent
permissible under California law.

The articles of incorporation also authorize the indemnification of
CUB's agents (including any current or former director or officer
of CUB) for breach of duty in excess of indemnification otherwise
permitted by Section 317 of the CGCL, subject to the limits on
indemnification set forth in Section 204 of the CGCL. Section 204
prohibits indemnifying directors for (i) intentional misconduct or
knowing and culpable violations of law; (ii) acts or omissions that
a director believes are contrary to the best interests of the
corporation or its shareholders and involve the absence of good
faith; (iii) transactions from which a director derived an improper
personal benefit; (iv) acts or omissions that show a reckless
disregard for the director's duty to the corporation or its
shareholders; (v) acts or omissions that constitute an unexcused
pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the
director's duty to the corporation or its shareholders; or
(vi) actions under Sections 310 and 316 of the CGCL.

CUB's bylaws also provide that each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise
involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she
is or was a director or officer of the corporation, will be
indemnified and held harmless by CUB to the fullest extent
authorized by California law.

 PacWest's certificate of incorporation provides that a director of
PacWest will not be liable to PacWest or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except to the extent that such exemption from liability or
limitation thereof is not permitted under Delaware law. Delaware
law would not allow for exoneration of liability of a director
(i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to PacWest or its
stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which
involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law;
(iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, referred to as the DGCL; or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
benefit.

PacWest's bylaws also provide that PacWest will indemnify any
person who is or was a director or officer of PacWest who was or
is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any
action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director or officer of PacWest, to the fullest extent permitted
by law.

CUB  PacWest
Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws

Generally, the CGCL requires a vote of the majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote to amend the articles of
incorporation.

New bylaws may be adopted and the bylaws may be amended or
repealed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote, or by the written assent of shareholders
entitled to vote such shares, except as otherwise provided by law
or by the articles of incorporation.

Subject to the rights of the shareholders as provided in the bylaws,
bylaws other than a bylaw or an amendment thereof changing the
authorized number of directors may be adopted, amended or
repealed by the board of directors.

 PacWest's certificate of incorporation may be amended in any
manner allowed under Delaware law.

PacWest's bylaws may be amended by the board of directors, but
the stockholders entitled to vote may adopt additional bylaws and
may amend or repeal any bylaw whether or not adopted by them.

Business Combination Restrictions

Section 1101 of the CGCL requires that, in a merger of a
corporation with a shareholder (or its affiliate) who holds more
than 50% but less than 90% of the corporation's common stock,
the other shareholders of the corporation must receive common
stock in the transaction, unless all the corporation's shareholders
consent to the transaction.

Section 1203 of the CGCL also provides that, except in certain
circumstances, when a tender offer or a proposal for a
reorganization or sale of assets is made by an interested party
(generally a controlling or managing party of the corporation), the
interested party must provide the other shareholders with a written
opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to be paid to the
shareholders. Furthermore, if a tender of shares or a vote is sought
pursuant to an interested party's proposal and a later proposal is
made by another party at least 10 days prior to the date of
acceptance of the interested party's proposal, the shareholders
must be informed of the later offer and be afforded a reasonable
opportunity to withdraw their vote, consent or proxy, and to
withdraw any tendered shares.

 Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits a Delaware corporation from
engaging in a "business combination" (as defined under Delaware
law) with a person owning 15% or more of the corporation's
voting stock for three years following the time that a person
becomes a 15% stockholder, with certain exceptions. PacWest, in
its certificate of incorporation, has opted out of Section 203 and is
not subject to these restrictions.

Table of Contents

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 

        The following summary description of the capital stock of PacWest does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to PacWest's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the DGCL. Pursuant to PacWest's certificate of incorporation,
PacWest has the authority to issue up to 200 million shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 5 million shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share. Each share of PacWest common stock has the same relative rights, and is identical in all respects, with
each other share of PacWest common stock. PacWest common stock is traded on NASDAQ under the symbol "PACW." PacWest common
stock represents non-withdrawable capital and will not be insured by the FDIC. All of the outstanding shares of stock are, and any stock
issued pursuant to the merger agreement will be, fully paid and nonassessable.

Limitation of Liability and Indemnification Matters 

        PacWest's certificate of incorporation provides that a director of PacWest will not be liable to PacWest or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent that such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is
not permitted under Delaware law. PacWest's bylaws also provide that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, PacWest will indemnify
any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
by reason of the fact that such person or such person's testator or intestate is or was a director, officer or employee of PacWest or serves or
served at the request of PacWest as a director, officer or employee of any other enterprise. Expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by
any such person in defending any such action, suit or proceeding will be paid or reimbursed by PacWest promptly upon receipt by PacWest
of a commitment from such person to repay such expenses if it will ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified by PacWest. The bylaws do not limit the power of PacWest or its board of directors to provide other indemnification and
expense reimbursement rights to directors, officers, employees, agents and other persons as otherwise pursuant to the bylaws.

Anti-Takeover Provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 

        Certain provisions of PacWest's certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it less likely that PacWest's management would be
changed or someone would acquire voting control of PacWest without the consent of PacWest's board of directors. These provisions could
delay, deter or prevent tender offers or takeover attempts that stockholders might believe are in their best interests, including tender offers
or takeover attempts that could allow stockholders to receive premiums over the market price of their common stock.

Preferred Stock

        PacWest's board of directors can at any time, under PacWest's certificate of incorporation and without stockholder approval, issue one
or more new series of preferred stock. In some cases, the issuance of preferred stock could discourage or make more difficult attempts to
take control of PacWest through a merger, tender offer, proxy context or otherwise. Preferred stock with special voting rights or other
features issued to persons favoring PacWest's management could stop a takeover by preventing the person trying to take control of
PacWest from acquiring enough voting shares necessary to take control.

Nomination Procedures

        Holders of PacWest common stock can nominate candidates for PacWest's board of directors. A stockholder must follow the advance
notice procedures described in PacWest's bylaws. In general, to

nominate a person for election to PacWest's board of directors at a meeting of PacWest's stockholders, a stockholder must submit a written
notice of the proposed nomination to PacWest's corporate secretary at least 90 but not more than 120 days before the meeting.

Amendment of Bylaws

        Under PacWest's bylaws, PacWest's board of directors can adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws, subject to limitations under the DGCL.
PacWest's stockholders also have the power to change or repeal PacWest's bylaws.

Common Stock 

Voting Rights

        Holders of PacWest common stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all matters requiring stockholder action, including, but not
limited to, the election of directors. Cumulative voting is permitted so long as the name of the candidates for whom such votes would be
cast has been placed in nomination prior to the voting and at least one stockholder has given notice at the meeting prior to the voting of
such stockholder's intention to cumulate votes. In an election of directors under cumulative voting, each share of voting stock is entitled to
vote the number of votes to which such share would normally be entitled, multiplied by the number of directors to be elected. A
stockholder may then cast all such votes for a single candidate or may allocate them among as many candidates as the stockholder may
choose. Cumulative voting may enable a minority stockholder or group of stockholders to elect at least one representative to the board of
directors. Without cumulative voting, the holders of a majority of the shares present at an annual meeting would have the power to elect all
the directors to be elected at that meeting, and no person could be elected without the support of a majority of the stockholders voting.
Without cumulative voting, any director or the entire board of directors of a corporation may be removed with or without cause with the
approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at an election of directors.

Dividends

        Holders of PacWest common stock may receive dividends when, as and if declared by PacWest's board of directors out of funds
legally available for payment of dividends, subject to any restrictions imposed by Federal regulators and the payment of any preferential
amounts to which any class of preferred stock may be entitled. Other restrictions on PacWest's ability to pay dividends are described below
under "—Restrictions on Dividends."

Liquidation Preference

        Holders of common stock are not entitled to a liquidation preference in respect of those shares. Upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of PacWest, holders of PacWest common stock will be entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after the payment of all
liabilities of PacWest and of preferential amounts to which any preferred stock may be entitled.

Other Matters

        The holders of the PacWest common stock will have no preemptive or other subscription rights. PacWest common stock will not be
subject to call or redemption.

Restrictions on Dividends

        PacWest's ability to pay dividends or to repurchase its common stock, and the ability of Pacific Western Bank to pay dividends to
PacWest, are restricted by several factors. First, PacWest is

112



9/8/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543643/000104746917004755/a2232770zdefm14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543643/000104746917004755/a2232770zdefm14a.htm 126/214

Table of Contents

incorporated in Delaware and is governed by the DGCL. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as
determined under Delaware law, or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and/or
for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, PacWest cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after PacWest pays the
dividend, PacWest's capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the
distribution of assets.

        In addition, PacWest's ability to pay cash dividends or to repurchase shares of common stock may be limited by certain covenants
contained in the indentures governing trust preferred securities issued by PacWest or entities that it has acquired, and the debentures
underlying the trust preferred securities. Generally the indentures provide that if an event of default (as defined in the indentures) has
occurred and is continuing, or if PacWest is in default with respect to any obligations under its guarantee agreement which covers
payments of the obligations on the trust preferred securities, or if PacWest gives notice of any intention to defer payments of interest on the
debentures underlying the trust preferred securities, then PacWest may not, among other restrictions, declare or pay any dividends with
respect to its common stock or repurchase shares of common stock.

        Furthermore, notification to the FRB is required prior to PacWest's declaring and paying a cash dividend to its stockholders during
any period in which its quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other
requirements. Under such circumstances, PacWest may not pay a dividend should the FRB object until such time as PacWest receives
approval from the FRB or no longer needs to provide notice under applicable regulations.

        Finally, PacWest's ability to pay dividends depends largely on its receipt of cash dividends from Pacific Western Bank, which are
limited by various statutes and regulations. Dividends paid by Pacific Western Bank are regulated by the CDBO and the FDIC under their
general supervisory authority as it relates to a bank's capital requirements. Pacific Western Bank may declare a dividend without the
approval of the CDBO and the FDIC as long as the total dividends declared in a calendar year do not exceed either the retained earnings or
the total of net earnings for three previous fiscal years less any dividend paid during such period. During the year ended December 31,
2016, PacWest received $259 million in dividends from Pacific Western Bank. Since Pacific Western Bank had a retained deficit of
$520.0 million at December 31, 2016, for the foreseeable future, any further cash dividends from Pacific Western Bank to PacWest will
continue to require CDBO and FDIC approval.

        Refer to "Business—Supervision and Regulation" in PacWest's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and similar sections in
PacWest's future filings for more information about restrictions on the ability of PacWest's subsidiary to pay PacWest dividends.

Restrictions on Ownership of PacWest's Common Stock

        Under the BHC Act, any person or company is required to obtain the approval of the FRB before acquiring control of PacWest,
which, among other things, includes the acquisition of ownership of or control over 25% or more of any class of voting securities of
PacWest or the power to exercise a "controlling influence" over PacWest. In the case of an acquirer that is a bank or bank holding
company, the BHC Act requires approval of the FRB for the acquisition of ownership or control of any voting securities of PacWest, if the
acquisition results in the bank or bank holding company controlling more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of PacWest's
voting securities. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person, entity, or group of persons or entities acting in concert, from
acquiring "control" of a bank holding company such as PacWest unless the FRB has been given prior notice and has not objected to the
transaction. Under FRB regulations, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of PacWest would generally be deemed an
acquisition of control of PacWest.

Transfer Agent

        The transfer agent for PacWest common stock is Wells Fargo Shareowner Services.

Table of Contents

        AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 5, 2017 (this "Agreement"), by and between PacWest Bancorp, a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and CU Bancorp, a California corporation (the "Company") (collectively hereinafter referred to as the
"Parties").

RECITALS 

        WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and the California General Corporation Law (the "CGCL"), the Company will merge with and into
Parent (the "Merger"), with Parent as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving
Corporation");

        WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent and the Company have determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of their respective companies and their respective stockholders, as
applicable, and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, all
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

        WHEREAS, immediately after the Merger, California United Bank, a California state-chartered bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company ("CU Bank"), will merge with and into Pacific Western Bank, a California state-chartered bank and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("PW Bank"), with PW Bank as the surviving bank (the "Bank Merger");

        WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes (and, where applicable, state and local income tax purposes), the Parties
intend that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code");

        WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to
enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company have simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting Agreement (each a
"Voting Agreement" and collectively, the "Voting Agreements") in connection with the Merger, in the form of Exhibit A hereto;

        WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to
enter into this Agreement, (i) each executive officer and each member of the board of directors of the Company is entering into a non-

        (a)    Outstanding Company Common Stock.    Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7.01(g), each share of Company
Common Stock (each, a "Share" and, collectively, "Shares"), excluding Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become and be converted into the right to receive (i) $12.00 in cash (the
"Cash Consideration") and (ii) 0.5308 of a share (the "Exchange Ratio") of Parent Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration" and
together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), without interest thereon. At the Effective Time, all Shares
(other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any Shares (a
"Certificate") and each holder of a Share not represented by a Certificate (a "Book-Entry Share"), other than any Excluded Shares
and Dissenting Shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration plus
any dividends or distributions to which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.03(c) as well as any cash in
lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.03(d).

        (b)    Outstanding Parent Stock.    Each share of Parent Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

        (c)    Outstanding Series A Preferred Stock.    Prior to Closing, Parent and the Company agree to reasonably cooperate with
respect to the purchase by the Company in accordance with Section 5.21 of this Agreement ("Preferred Stock Purchase") from the

therefor.

to exist at the Effective Time of the Merger and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

        (e)    Dissenting Shares.    

          (i)  No later than ten (10) calendar days following the date that the Company Shareholder Approval is received, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation shall provide each record holder of Company Common Stock entitled to vote on
the Merger with a notice including the information set forth in Section 1301(a) of the CGCL.

         (ii)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent dissenters' rights under
Section 1301(a) are applicable to the Merger, no Dissenting Shares shall be converted into or represent a right to receive
the applicable consideration for such shares set forth in this Agreement, if any, but the holder of such Dissenting Shares
shall only be entitled to such dissenters' rights to the extent granted by Chapter 13 of the CGCL. If a holder of shares of
Company Common Stock who demands that the Company purchase such shares under Chapter 13 of the CGCL shall
thereafter effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders' dissenters' rights with respect
to such shares of Company Common Stock then, as of the occurrence of such withdrawal or loss, each such share of
Company Common Stock shall be deemed as of the Effective Time to have been converted into and represent only the right
to receive, in accordance with Section 3.01, the Merger Consideration for such shares set forth in this Article III.

        (iii)  The Company shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Chapter 13 of the CGCL with respect to the
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for purchase of any such shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL and received by the Company in connection therewith and (B) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to purchase of any shares of Company Common Stock
under Chapter 13 of the CGCL; provided that Parent shall act in a commercially reasonable manner in directing any such
negotiations and proceedings. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as required by law,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for purchase of Company Common Stock or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.

        3.02    Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers.     At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and
shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company other than to receive the Merger Consideration (together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor). After the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        3.03    Exchange Procedures.     

        (a)    Exchange Agent.    Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an
exchange agent selected by Parent with the Company's prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
(the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Shares (in each case, other than holders of Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares), an amount in cash equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus any cash due in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.03(d) and certificates or, at Parent's option, evidence of shares in book-entry form
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for Shares outstanding immediately

prior to the Effective Time, deliverable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 3.03(f)) or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the transmittal materials,
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and after the Effective Time, if applicable, any dividends or other distributions with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock (such amount in cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Company shall notify Parent in writing prior to the Effective Time of the
number of Shares, Excluded Shares and, to the extent practicable, Dissenting Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and shall cause the Company's transfer agent to deliver to the Exchange Agent on or prior to the Closing Date a list of the
holders of Company Common Stock in a format that is reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent and otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the Exchange Agent.

        (b)    Exchange Procedures.    Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter),
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate
transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof, as provided in Section 3.03(f)) and instructions for surrendering the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent (such materials and instructions to include customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to Book-Entry Shares and to be in such form and have
such provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree). Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such
transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form, as applicable) representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III and (y) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.03(g)) equal to (A) the Cash Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this ARTICLE 3 plus (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares plus (C) any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other
dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
together with a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate, may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee
if the Exchange Agent is presented with the Certificate formerly representing such Shares and/or all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

        (c)    Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting.    All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if a dividend or other distribution is declared by
Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall
include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares until such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares are
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any

Section 3.03(f)) or Book-Entry Shares, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

        (d)    Fractional Shares.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock will be issued and any holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this
Section 3.03(d) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu thereof (rounded to the nearest cent), which payment shall be
determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of the share (rounded to the nearest thousandth
when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 3.01(a).

        (e)    Termination of Exchange Fund.    The Exchange Fund shall be administered by the Exchange Agent until such time as
any unclaimed portion thereof is delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

        (f)    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.    In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent
Common Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

        (g)    Withholding Rights.    Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

        (h)    Adjustments.    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares or the
issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Parent Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, redenomination,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Exchange Ratio and the Merger
Consideration, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement.

        3.04    Treatment of Equity Awards.     

        (a)    Treatment of Options.    At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
(a "Company Option") under the Company's 2007 Equity and Incentive Plan (the "Company Stock Plan") or the 1st Enterprise
Bank 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Company Stock Option Plan"), whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled
and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Option to receive, as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective
Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess,
if any, of (A) the Equity Award Cashout Price over (B) the exercise price per Share under such Company Option, less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment (such amount, the "Option Consideration"); provided that to
the extent reasonably practicable, Parent shall have the option to fund the Option Consideration to be paid with respect to
Company Options by funding the necessary amounts to the payroll processor of the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates (the "Payroll Processor") for payment by the Payroll Processor of the Option Consideration to the applicable holders of
such Company Options. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option which has an exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Equity Award Cashout Price shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no
consideration or payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Equity Award Cashout Price" shall mean an amount equal to
(1) the Cash Consideration plus (2) the product of (x) the Parent Average Closing Price and (y) the Exchange Ratio, as may be
adjusted pursuant to Section 7.01(g).

        (b)    Company Restricted Shares.    At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted
stock award (a "Company Restricted Share") under the Company Stock Plan, shall, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full and such Company Restricted Share shall be converted into, and become
exchanged for, the Merger Consideration (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting, which Tax
withholding may, at the election of the holder, be effected by deduction from such Merger Consideration of a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock having a fair market value, based on the closing price of shares of Parent Common Stock quoted on
NASDAQ for the Closing Date, equal to the amount of Taxes to be withheld), pursuant to Section 3.01(a).

        (c)    Company RSUs.    At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted stock unit (a
"Company RSU") under the Company Stock Plan shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, accelerate in full and such Company RSU shall be converted into, and become exchanged for, the Merger Consideration
(less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such vesting, which Tax withholding may, at the election of the
holder, be effected by deduction from such Merger Consideration of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock having a fair
market value, based on the closing price of shares of Parent Common Stock quoted on NASDAQ for the Closing Date, equal to the
amount of Taxes to be withheld), pursuant to Section 3.01(a).

        (d)    Company Actions.    At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the Compensation,
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any
actions that are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company RSUs
(the "Company Equity Awards") pursuant to Section 3.04(a) through 3.04(c).

        The Company shall take all actions that are necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any Person
pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity Awards.

other Rights issued or outstanding with respect to Parent Common Stock, and Parent does not have any commitment to authorize,

and are not subject to preemptive rights (and were not issued in violation of any preemptive rights).

to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and

regulations thereunder. Each of the Company and Parent agrees that if such Party shall become aware prior to the Effective Time of
any information furnished by such Party that would cause any of the statements in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or that would result in an omission to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other Party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement.

          (i)  The Company Board and each committee thereof shall not:

        (b)   Reserved.

        (c)   The Company agrees that, subject to applicable Laws, it shall cooperate in good faith with Parent on preparing for the
development of mutually agreed operating issues to be implemented after the Effective Time, which the Parties agree have priority
including assisting in developing and implementing plans for integration and conversion and other matters affecting branches,
customers and back office operations.

        (d)   Each Party agrees that it will, and will cause its representatives to, hold any information obtained pursuant to this
Section 5.07 in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 2, 2017 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), between Parent and the Company.

        (e)   No investigation by either Party of the business and affairs of the other Party shall affect or be deemed to modify or
waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to such Party's obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        5.08    Acquisition Proposals.     The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees and Affiliates shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' agents
and representatives (including any financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it or acting on its behalf) not to, directly or
indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees and Affiliates shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its agents and representatives (including
any financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it or acting on its behalf) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (A) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect
that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement; (B) at any time prior, but not after, the Company
Shareholder Approval is obtained, providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms not less restrictive in the aggregate to the other party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; or
(C) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if
and only to the extent that, in each such case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to violate the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that it
will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 5.08. The Company agrees that it will notify Parent promptly, but in no event later than the next succeeding Business Day, if any
such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and
the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

        5.09    Certain Policies.     Immediately prior to the Effective Time and provided that Parent has confirmed in writing that all
conditions to its obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived and that it is prepared to effect the Merger, the Company
and CU Bank shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the rules and regulations of the CDBO, FDIC and
applicable banking Law, modify or change its loan, other real estate owned, accrual, reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate valuation
policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of PW
Bank; provided, however, that unless the modification or changes would otherwise be necessary to be consistent with applicable Law or
with regulatory accounting principles and GAAP, no such modification or change shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of
or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be
considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred, or as an admission or
acknowledgement by the Company that any such modification or change is appropriate or required or that any financial statement or
information previously provided by the Company was incorrect in any respect.

        5.10    Regulatory Applications.     

        (a)   Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, or in
the case of Parent cause to be filed, all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third parties and/or Governmental
Authorities in order to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby; and any
initial filings with Governmental Authorities shall be made by Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution hereof
and in any event within forty-five (45) calendar days of the date hereof. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each of Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each shall
consult with the other on, all written information submitted to any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right,
each of such Parties agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each Party hereto agrees that it shall consult with the
other Party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and/or
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party
shall keep the other Party apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including promptly furnishing the other with copies of the non-confidential portions of notices or other communications received
by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, from any third party and/or Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger, the
Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, to the extent permitted by Law, providing
descriptions of any oral communications from such Persons). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental
Authorities that would reasonably be likely, in each case following the Effective Time (but regardless when the action, condition or
restriction is to be taken or implemented), to (i) have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (measured on a scale relative to the
Company) or a Company Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) require Parent, PW Bank or the Surviving Corporation or the surviving
bank in the Bank Merger to raise additional capital in an amount that would materially reduce the economic benefits of the Merger
to Parent or the holders of Parent Common Stock (including the Company shareholders in respect of shares of Parent Common
Stock received by them in the Merger) (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition").

        (b)   Each Party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in
connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other Party to any third party and/or Governmental
Authority.

        5.11    Indemnification; Director's and Officer's Insurance.     

        (a)   Parent agrees that from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company (each, an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a "Claim"), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided, however, the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).
Further, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, perform and observe the obligations of the Company under any agreements in
effect as of the date of this Agreement to indemnify those Persons who are or have at any time been directors and officers of the
Company for their acts and omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in their capacity as officers or directors.

        (b)   Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 5.11, upon learning of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent or the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if
such failure does not materially prejudice Parent or the Surviving Corporation. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for
any legal expenses or other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof; provided, however, that none of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any Claim for which indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of
such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent, (ii) the
Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

        (c)   For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide that portion of director's
and officer's liability insurance ("D&O Insurance") that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors
(determined as of the Effective Time) of the Company with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts
or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time, which D&O Insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and
amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to such

officers and directors, as that coverage currently provided by the Company; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in the aggregate for such six (6)-year period more than 250% of the current amount expended
on an annual basis by the Company to maintain or procure such D&O Insurance; provided, further, that if the Surviving
Corporation is unable to maintain or obtain the D&O Insurance called for by this Section 5.11, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available at a cost in the aggregate for such six (6)-year period up to 250% of the
current annual premium; provided, further, that officers and directors of the Company may be required to make application and
provide customary representations and warranties to the Surviving Corporation's insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining
such D&O Insurance. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent shall or, with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company may,
purchase, at or prior to the Effective Time, a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of the directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, at an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding 250% of the current annual premium for such
insurance. If such prepaid "tail" policy has been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation, and no other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance pursuant to this Section 5.11(c).

        (d)   If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

        5.12    Benefit Plans.     

        (a)   From the Effective Time through the first anniversary thereof, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each of
the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who continue employment with
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (such employees "Continuing Employees") with a base salary or base
wage, cash incentive opportunities and pension and welfare opportunities (excluding equity and long term incentive compensation)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries.

        (b)   Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its employee benefit and compensation plans to take into
account, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, levels of benefits and benefit accrual thereunder, the service of the Continuing
Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any predecessor entities) as if such service were with Parent, to the
same extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent
it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service and other than for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined benefit pension plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries and for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits).

        (c)   From and after the Effective Time, without limiting the generality of Section 5.12(a), with respect to each Continuing
Employee (and their beneficiaries) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each life, disability, medical, dental or
health plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which each such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate to (i) waive any
preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the

applicable life, disability, medical, dental or health plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide full credit under
medical, dental and health plans for any deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Continuing
Employees (and their beneficiaries) under analogous plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation, actively-at-work
requirement or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such Continuing Employees and their
beneficiaries on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee or beneficiary had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time.

        (d)   Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of
the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause the Company's 401(k) Plan (the "Company 401(k) Plan") to be
terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be
terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which
shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time; provided,
however, that the effectiveness of such termination may be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

        (e)   To the extent any Benefit Plan limits the amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits)
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof
or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) in order to preclude such amount from being considered an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, the Company shall not waive any such limitation or
amend any such Benefit Plan to eliminate or materially alter such limitation.

        (f)    Prior to making any written or oral communications to a broad-based group of the officers or employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefits matters that are materially affected by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have
a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication, and the Company shall consider any such comments in
good faith.

        5.13    Notification of Certain Matters.     Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known
to it, to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or to prevent, materially delay
or materially impair the ability of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein.

        5.14    Third-Party Agreements.     

        (a)   The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain (i) the consents or waivers required to be obtained from any
third parties in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (in such form and
content as mutually agreed by the Parties) promptly after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the cooperation of such third parties
(including at Parent's request, with respect to the termination of Contracts following the Effective Time) to effect a smooth
transition in accordance with the Parties' timetable at or after the Effective Time.

        (b)   Without limiting the generality of Section 5.14(a), each of the Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to provide data
processing, item processing and other processing support or

outside contractors to assist in performing all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful conversion of the data and other
files and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to Parent's production environment, in such a manner sufficient to ensure that
a successful conversion will occur at the time (on or after the Effective Time) mutually agreed by the Parties, subject to any
applicable Laws, including Laws regarding the exchange of information and other Laws regarding competition. Among other
things, the Company shall:

          (i)  reasonably cooperate with Parent to establish a mutually agreeable project plan to effectuate the conversion;

         (ii)  use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Company's outside contractors continue to support both the
conversion effort and its ongoing needs until the conversion can be established;

        (iii)  provide, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from any outside contractors, all data or other files
and layouts reasonably requested by Parent for use in planning the conversion, as soon as reasonably practicable;

        (iv)  provide reasonable access to the Company's personnel and facilities and, with the consent of its outside
contractors, its outside contractors' personnel and facilities, to enable the conversion effort to be completed on schedule;
and

         (v)  give notice of termination, conditioned upon the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
of the Contracts of outside data, item and other processing contractors or other third-party vendors to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries are bound when directed to do so by Parent.

        (c)   Parent agrees that all actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.14 shall be taken in a manner intended to minimize
disruption to the customary business activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

        5.15    Closing Financial Statements.     At least eight (8) Business Days prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company shall
provide Parent with the Company's consolidated financial statements presenting the financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and the
Company's consolidated results of operations for the period from January 1, 2017 through the close of business on the last day of the last
month ended prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (the "Closing Financial Statements"); provided, however, that if the Effective Time
of the Merger occurs on or before the fifteenth (15th) Business Day of the month, the Company shall have provided consolidated financial
statements as of and through the second month preceding the Effective Time of the Merger. Such financial statements shall have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP and regulatory accounting principles and other applicable legal and accounting requirements, and
reflect all period-end accruals and other adjustments. Such financial statements shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Company's
chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such financial statements continue to reflect accurately, as of the
date of the certificate, the financial condition of the Company in all material respects. Such Closing Financial Statements shall also reflect
accruals for all Professional Fees incurred or expected to be incurred (whether or not doing so is in accordance with GAAP) and shall be
accompanied by a certificate of the Company's chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that such financial
statements meet the requirements of this Section 5.15.

        5.17    Section 16 Matters.     Each of the Company Board and the Parent Board shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such
actions as may be necessary or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act to exempt the conversion
of shares of Company Common Stock into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by officers and
directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or by employees of the Company
who may become an officer or director of Parent subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. In

respective boards of directors prior to such adoption and (y) copies of such resolutions as adopted, and each Party shall provide the other
Party with such information as shall be reasonably necessary for the other Party's board of directors to set forth the information required in
the resolutions of such board of directors.

        5.18    Takeover Statute.     At all times prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall: (a) take all reasonable action necessary to
ensure that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including
the Merger; and (b) if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
including the Merger, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

        5.19    Bank Merger.     Immediately after the Merger, the Bank Merger will occur, with PW Bank as the surviving bank. The Parties

cooperation and take all reasonable actions as may be requested by Parent in connection with the Preferred Stock Purchase, including by

         (ii)  The number obtained by dividing the Parent Average Closing Price by the Initial Parent Stock Price is less than
the number obtained by subtracting (A) the Index Ratio minus (B) 0.15.

        If the Company elects to terminate pursuant to this Section 7.01(g) and provides such written notice to Parent, then within two
(2) Business Days following Parent's receipt of such notice, Parent may elect by written notice to the Company to reinstate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (A) adjust the Exchange Ratio to equal a number equal to the lesser of (I) a
quotient (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth), the numerator of which is $23.80 and the denominator of which is the Parent Average
Closing Price and (II) a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth), the numerator of which is $23.80 and the denominator of which
is the Parent Average Closing Price, multiplied by the Index Ratio, or (B) in the alternative, not adjust the Exchange Ratio, and, in lieu of
thereof, add an amount in cash to the Cash Consideration such that each holder of Company Common Stock would be entitled to receive,
in respect of each share of Company Common Stock, the equivalent value, based on the Parent Average Closing Price for each share of
Company Common Stock as such holder would have received had the Exchange Ratio been adjusted in accordance with clause (A). If
Parent makes such election to reinstate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no termination will occur
pursuant to this Section 7.01(g) and this Agreement will remain in effect according to its terms (except as the Merger Consideration has
been adjusted).

        For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings indicated below:

        "Determination Date" means the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date.

        "Determination Period" means the period beginning on the day that is twenty (20) consecutive trading days prior to the
Determination Date and ending on the Determination Date.

        "Final Index Price" means the average closing price of the KBW Regional Banking Index as quoted on Bloomberg.com (KRX:IND)
during the Determination Period.

        "Index Ratio" means the Final Index Price divided by the Initial Index Price.

        "Initial Index Price" means 105.39.

        "Initial Parent Stock Price" means $52.75 per share.

        If Parent or any company belonging to the KBW Regional Banking Index declares or effects a stock dividend, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the prices for the common stock
of such company will be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 7.01(g).

        7.02    Effect of Termination and Abandonment.     

        (a)   In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VII, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability or further obligation of any kind on the part of any Party (or of any
of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other representatives), except (i) as provided in
Section 7.02(b) and (ii) that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any
willful and intentional breach of this Agreement.

        (b)   (i) The Company shall pay a termination fee of $26,500,000 (the "Termination Fee") to Parent payable by wire transfer

contemplated by this Agreement, and that without such agreements Parent would not have entered into this Agreement, and that
such amounts do not constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to promptly pay Parent any amounts due under paragraph (b) above
within the time period specified therein, the Company shall pay all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by
Parent from the date such amounts were required to be paid in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit,
taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any such unpaid amounts at the publicly
announced prime rate of interest printed in The Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to be made.

Appendix B 

Form of Voting Agreement, dated April 5, 2017, between PacWest Bancorp and certain stockholders of CU Bancorp 

April 5, 2017

PacWest Bancorp
9701 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 700
Beverly Hills, CA 90212

Ladies and Gentlemen:

        As a holder of Company Common Shares (as defined below), the undersigned on behalf of [    ·    ] (the "Shareholder") understands
that CU Bancorp, a California corporation (the "Company"), and PacWest Bancorp, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), are concurrently
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 5, 2017 (as it may be from time to time amended, the "Merger
Agreement"), which was previously approved by the boards of directors of the Company and Parent, providing for, among other things, a
merger of the Company with and into Parent (the "Merger"), in which each of the issued and outstanding common shares, no par value per
share, of the Company (the "Company Common Shares") (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. Terms used without definition in this letter agreement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto
in the Merger Agreement.

        The Shareholder acknowledges that, as an inducement for Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required that the
Shareholder enter into this letter agreement and the Shareholder is willing to enter into this letter agreement.

        The Shareholder confirms his or her agreement with Parent, and Parent confirms its agreement with the Shareholder, as follows:

        1.     As used in this letter agreement, "Shares" means the shares of the Company Common Shares which the Shareholder
owns of record or beneficially and has the power to vote (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any shares underlying options or
restricted stock units exercisable for Company Common Shares whether or not such shares are included as beneficially owned by
the Shareholder in the Company's most recent annual proxy statement) as of the date of this letter agreement which are listed on
Schedule I hereto. The Shares are owned by the Shareholder free and clear of all encumbrances, voting arrangements and
commitments of every kind, except as would not restrict the performance of the Shareholder's obligations under this Agreement.
The Shareholder represents and warrants that the Shareholder has the sole or shared power to vote or direct the vote of all Shares.

        2.     Subject to paragraph 17 of this letter agreement, at every meeting of the shareholders of the Company called, and at
every postponement, recess or adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of the shareholders of the
Company, the Shareholder agrees to vote, or cause to be voted, the Shares (a) in favor of (i) approval of the principal terms of the
Merger Agreement and (ii) any other matter that is required to be approved by the shareholders of the Company to facilitate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (b) against (i) any proposal made in opposition to approval of the principal
terms of the Merger Agreement or in competition with the Merger, (ii) any Acquisition Proposal and (iii) to the extent that any of
the following actions requires a shareholder vote pursuant to applicable Law or any applicable stock exchange rules, any proposal,
transaction, agreement, amendment of the Company's articles of incorporation or by-laws or other action that is intended to or
could reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or discourage consummation of the Merger and
(c) as directed by Parent with respect to any postponement, recess, adjournment or other

procedural matter at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company relating to any of the matters set forth in the foregoing
clauses (a) or (b). Any such vote shall be cast (or consent shall be given) by the Shareholder in accordance with such procedures
relating thereto so as to ensure that it is duly counted, including for purposes of determining that a quorum is present and for
purposes of recording the results of such vote (or consent). The Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and
agrees not to exercise, any rights of appraisal, any dissenters' rights and any similar rights relating to the Merger that the
Shareholder may directly or indirectly have by virtue of the ownership of any Shares if the Effective Time occurs.

        3.     The Shareholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to the Shares. By entering into this
letter agreement, subject to the last sentence of this paragraph 3, the Shareholder hereby grants, or agrees to cause the applicable
record holder to grant, a revocable proxy appointing Parent, Matthew P. Wagner, Patrick Rusnak and Kori Ogrosky, and each of
them, but each with full power of substitution, as the Shareholder's attorney-in-fact and proxy, for and in the Shareholder's name, to
be counted as present, vote, express consent or dissent with respect to the Shares in the manner contemplated by paragraph 2 as
such proxies or their proxies or substitutes shall, in their sole discretion, deem proper with respect to the Shares. The proxy granted
by the Shareholder pursuant to this paragraph 3 is granted in consideration of Parent entering into this letter agreement and the
Merger Agreement and incurring the obligations therein. If the Shareholder fails for any reason to be counted as present, consent or
vote the Shares in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2 (or anticipatorily breaches such paragraph), then Parent shall
have the right to cause to be present, consent or vote the Shares in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2. The proxy
granted by the Shareholder shall be automatically revoked upon termination of this letter agreement in accordance with its terms.

        4.     The Shareholder represents and warrants (a) that the Shareholder has duly executed and delivered this letter agreement
and has all authority and full legal capacity to enter into this letter agreement; (b) that, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery of this letter agreement by Parent, this letter agreement is the Shareholder's legal, valid and binding agreement and is
enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
subject to the general principles of equity; and (c) that if the Shareholder is married and the Shares set forth next to such
Shareholder's name on Schedule I constitute community property under applicable Law, this letter agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitutes the valid and binding agreement of, such Shareholder's spouse, except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to the general principles of equity.

        5.     The Shareholder further represents and warrants that the execution and delivery of this letter agreement by the
Shareholder does not, and the performance of his or her obligations under this letter agreement and the consummation of the
transactions to be consummated by him or her as contemplated hereby will not, (a) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to
the Shareholder or by which the Shares are bound or affected, (b) result in any breach of or violation of, or constitute a default (or
an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of an encumbrance on any of the Shares pursuant to, any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the
Shareholder is a party or by which the Shareholder or the Shares are bound or affected, or (c) require any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any court or arbitrator or any governmental entity, agency or official
except for (i) applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and

(ii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would
not prevent, impair, delay or adversely affect the performance by the Shareholder of his or her obligations under this letter
agreement.

        6.     The Shareholder agrees that all representations, terms and conditions of this letter agreement will apply to Company
Common Shares of which the Shareholder acquires record or beneficial ownership (and the power to vote) after the date hereof and
prior to the termination of this letter agreement, whether upon the exercise of options, warrants or rights, the conversion or
exchange of convertible or exchangeable securities, or by means of purchase, dividend, distribution, split-up, recapitalization,
combination, exchange of shares or the like, gift, bequest, inheritance, or as a successor in interest in any capacity or otherwise.

        7.     This letter agreement and all obligations of the parties hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of (a) the
Effective Time and (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms; provided, however, that (i) this
paragraph 7 and paragraphs 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20 and 21 hereof shall survive any such termination and (ii) such termination
shall not relieve any party of any liability or damages resulting from any willful and intentional breach of this letter agreement
occurring prior to such termination.

        8.     The Shareholder is entering into this letter agreement solely in his or her capacity as a record or beneficial owner of the
Shares and nothing herein is intended to or shall limit or affect any actions taken by the Shareholder, solely in his or her capacity as
a director or officer of the Company (or a Subsidiary of the Company), including any actions Shareholder deems necessary to
discharge his or her fiduciary duties with respect to his or her role on the Company Board of Directors.

        9.     The Shareholder hereby authorizes Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure
in connection with the Merger the Shareholder's identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of the Shareholder's
obligations under this letter agreement.

        10.   The Shareholder agrees that, prior to the termination of this letter agreement, the Shareholder shall not take any action
that would make any representation or warranty of the Shareholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of
preventing, impairing, delaying or adversely affecting the performance by the Shareholder of his or her obligations under this letter
agreement other than to a de minimis extent. The Shareholder agrees, without further consideration, to execute and deliver such
additional documents and to take such further actions as are reasonably necessary or reasonably requested by Parent to confirm and
assure the rights and obligations set forth in this letter agreement.

        11.   THIS LETTER AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. The parties hereby irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California and the federal courts of the United States of America located in
the State of California solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this letter agreement and of the
documents referred to in this letter agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree
not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such documents,

or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this letter agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by

subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding
in the manner provided in paragraph 13 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof.

        12.   The parties to this letter agreement acknowledge and agree that any controversy which may arise under this letter
agreement and the other documents referred to in this letter agreement and in respect of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, each such party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any legal action arising out of or relating to this
letter agreement and the other documents referred to in this letter agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The parties to this letter agreement certify and acknowledge that (a) such party has not
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not seek to enforce the foregoing waiver in the event of a legal
action, (b) such party has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) such party makes this waiver voluntarily and
(d) such party has been induced to enter into this letter agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this paragraph 12.

        13.   Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder by either party to the other shall be in writing
and delivered personally or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, by facsimile or by overnight courier addressed, if
to the Shareholder, to the address or facsimile number, as applicable, set forth in Schedule I hereto, and, if to Parent, in accordance
with Section 8.07 of the Merger Agreement, or to such other persons or addresses as may be designated in writing by the party to
receive such notice as provided above.

        14.   This letter agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise. Any purported assignment in violation of
this letter agreement is void.

        15.   The Shareholder recognizes and acknowledges that a breach of any covenants or agreements contained in this letter
agreement will cause Parent to sustain damages for which it would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and
therefore the Shareholder agrees that in the event of any such breach, Parent shall be entitled to specific performance of such
covenants and agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be
entitled, at law or in equity. It is accordingly agreed that Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this letter agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this letter agreement in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction.

        16.   The effectiveness of this letter agreement shall be conditioned upon the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement
by the parties thereto, which shall occur concurrently herewith.

        17.   The Shareholder agrees, prior to termination of this letter agreement, not to (i) offer for sale, sell, transfer, tender, pledge,
encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to,
or consent to the offer for sale, sale, transfer, tender, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of any of the Shares or
(ii) except as set forth herein, enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement, voting trust or otherwise,
with respect to any of the Shares, and shall not commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions; provided that the foregoing
shall not prohibit the Shareholder from (a) disposing of or surrendering Shares to the Company in connection with the vesting,
settlement or exercise of Company Options, Company Restricted Shares or Company RSUs for the payment of taxes thereon or, in
respect of Company Options, the exercise price thereon or (b) disposing of Shares in a broker-assisted cashless exercise of
Company Options expiring during the term of this letter agreement up to the amount necessary to

and instructs the Company to instruct its transfer agent to enter a stop transfer order with respect to all of the Shares.

        18.   Parent acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this letter agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or
indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and
relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Shareholder, and Parent shall have no authority to manage, direct,
superintend, restrict, regulate, govern or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or
authority to direct the Shareholder in the voting of any of the Shares, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

        19.   Any provision of this letter agreement may be (i) waived in whole or in part in writing by the party benefited by the
provision or by both parties or (ii) amended or modified at any time by an agreement in writing between the parties hereto
executed in the same manner as this letter agreement.

the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

        21.   In the event that any provision of this letter agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this letter agreement will continue in full force and
effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this letter agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

Appendix C 

Chapter 13 (Dissenters' Rights) of the California General Corporation Law 

1300. Reorganization or short-form merger; dissenting shares; corporate purchase at fair market value; definitions 

        (a)   If the approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152) of a corporation is required for a reorganization under subdivisions
(a) and (b) or subdivision (e) or (f) of Section 1201, each shareholder of the corporation entitled to vote on the transaction and each
shareholder of a subsidiary corporation in a short-form merger may, by complying with this chapter, require the corporation in which the
shareholder holds shares to purchase for cash at their fair market value the shares owned by the shareholder which are dissenting shares as
defined in subdivision (b). The fair market value shall be determined as of the day of, and immediately prior to, the first announcement of
the terms of the proposed reorganization or short-form merger, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in consequence of the proposed
reorganization or short-form merger, as adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, or share dividend that becomes effective thereafter.

        (b)   As used in this chapter, "dissenting shares" means shares to which all of the following apply:

        (1)   That were not, immediately prior to the reorganization or short-form merger, listed on any national securities exchange
certified by the Commissioner of Corporations under subdivision (o) of Section 25100, and the notice of meeting of shareholders
to act upon the reorganization summarizes this section and Sections 1301, 1302, 1303 and 1304; provided, however, that this
provision does not apply to any shares with respect to which there exists any restriction on transfer imposed by the corporation or
by any law or regulation; and provided, further, that this provision does not apply to any shares where the holder of those shares is
required, by the terms of the reorganization or short-form merger, to accept for the shares anything except: (A) shares of any other
corporation, which shares, at the time the reorganization or short-form merger is effective, are listed on any national securities
exchange certified by the Commissioner of Corporations under subdivision (o) of Section 25100; (B) cash in lieu of fractional
shares described in the foregoing subparagraph (A); or (C) any combination of the shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares
described in the foregoing subparagraphs (A) and (B).

        (2)   That were outstanding on the date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on the reorganization and
(A) were not voted in favor of the reorganization or, (B) if described in paragraph (1), were voted against the reorganization, or
were held of record on the effective date of a short-form merger; provided, however, that subparagraph (A) rather than
subparagraph (B) of this paragraph applies in any case where the approval required by Section 1201 is sought by written consent
rather than at a meeting.

        (3)   That the dissenting shareholder has demanded that the corporation purchase at their fair market value, in accordance with
Section 1301.

        (4)   That the dissenting shareholder has submitted for endorsement, in accordance with Section 1302.

        (c)   As used in this chapter, "dissenting shareholder" means the recordholder of dissenting shares and includes a transferee of record.

1301. Notice to holders of dissenting shares in reorganizations; demand for purchase; time; contents 

        (a)   If, in the case of a reorganization, any shareholders of a corporation have a right under Section 1300, subject to compliance with
paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (b) thereof, to require the corporation to purchase their shares for cash, that corporation shall mail to
each of those shareholders a notice of the approval of the reorganization by its outstanding shares (Section 152)

within 10 days after the date of that approval, accompanied by a copy of Sections 1300, 1302, 1303, and 1304 and this section, a statement
of the price determined by the corporation to represent the fair market value of the dissenting shares, and a brief description of the
procedure to be followed if the shareholder desires to exercise the shareholder's right under those sections. The statement of price
constitutes an offer by the corporation to purchase at the price stated any dissenting shares as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 1300,
unless they lose their status as dissenting shares under Section 1309.

        (b)   Any shareholder who has a right to require the corporation to purchase the shareholder's shares for cash under Section 1300,
subject to compliance with paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (b) thereof, and who desires the corporation to purchase shares shall
make written demand upon the corporation for the purchase of those shares and payment to the shareholder in cash of their fair market
value. The demand is not effective for any purpose unless it is received by the corporation or any transfer agent thereof (1) in the case of
shares described in subdivision (b) of Section 1300, not later than the date of the shareholders' meeting to vote upon the reorganization, or
(2) in any other case, within 30 days after the date on which the notice of the approval by the outstanding shares pursuant to subdivision
(a) or the notice pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1110 was mailed to the shareholder.

        (c)   The demand shall state the number and class of the shares held of record by the shareholder which the shareholder demands that
the corporation purchase and shall contain a statement of what the shareholder claims to be the fair market value of those shares as
determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1300. The statement of fair market value constitutes an offer by the shareholder to sell
the shares at that price.

1302. Submission of share certificates for endorsement; uncertificated securities 

        Within 30 days after the date on which notice of the approval by the outstanding shares or the notice pursuant to subdivision (h) of
Section 1110 was mailed to the shareholder, the shareholder shall submit to the corporation at its principal office or at the office of any
transfer agent thereof, (a) if the shares are certificated securities, the shareholder's certificates representing any shares which the
shareholder demands that the corporation purchase, to be stamped or endorsed with a statement that the shares are dissenting shares or to
be exchanged for certificates of appropriate denomination so stamped or endorsed or (b) if the shares are uncertificated securities, written
notice of the number of shares which the shareholder demands that the corporation purchase. Upon subsequent transfers of the dissenting
shares on the books of the corporation, the new certificates, initial transaction statement, and other written statements issued therefor shall
bear a like statement, together with the name of the original dissenting holder of the shares.

1303. Payment of agreed price with interest; agreement fixing fair market value; filing; time of payment 

        (a)   If the corporation and the shareholder agree that the shares are dissenting shares and agree upon the price of the shares, the
dissenting shareholder is entitled to the agreed price with interest thereon at the legal rate on judgments from the date of the agreement.
Any agreements fixing the fair market value of any dissenting shares as between the corporation and the holders thereof shall be filed with
the secretary of the corporation.

        (b)   Subject to the provisions of Section 1306, payment of the fair market value of dissenting shares shall be made within 30 days
after the amount thereof has been agreed or within 30 days after any statutory or contractual conditions to the reorganization are satisfied,
whichever is later, and in the case of certificated securities, subject to surrender of the certificates therefor, unless provided otherwise by
agreement.

1304. Action to determine whether shares are dissenting shares or fair market value; limitation; joinder; consolidation;
determination of issues; appointment of appraisers 

        (a)   If the corporation denies that the shares are dissenting shares, or the corporation and the shareholder fail to agree upon the fair
market value of the shares, then the shareholder demanding purchase of such shares as dissenting shares or any interested corporation,
within six months after the date on which notice of the approval by the outstanding shares (Section 152) or notice pursuant to subdivision
(h) of Section 1110 was mailed to the shareholder, but not thereafter, may file a complaint in the superior court of the proper county
praying the court to determine whether the shares are dissenting shares or the fair market value of the dissenting shares or both or may
intervene in any action pending on such a complaint.

        (b)   Two or more dissenting shareholders may join as plaintiffs or be joined as defendants in any such action and two or more such
actions may be consolidated.

        (c)   On the trial of the action, the court shall determine the issues. If the status of the shares as dissenting shares is in issue, the court
shall first determine that issue. If the fair market value of the dissenting shares is in issue, the court shall determine, or shall appoint one or
more impartial appraisers to determine, the fair market value of the shares.

1305. Report of appraisers; confirmation; determination by court; judgment; payment; appeal; costs 

        (a)   If the court appoints an appraiser or appraisers, they shall proceed forthwith to determine the fair market value per share. Within
the time fixed by the court, the appraisers, or a majority of them, shall make and file a report in the office of the clerk of the court.
Thereupon, on the motion of any party, the report shall be submitted to the court and considered on such evidence as the court considers
relevant. If the court finds the report reasonable, the court may confirm it.

        (b)   If a majority of the appraisers appointed fail to make and file a report within 10 days from the date of their appointment or within
such further time as may be allowed by the court or the report is not confirmed by the court, the court shall determine the fair market value
of the dissenting shares.

        (c)   Subject to the provisions of Section 1306, judgment shall be rendered against the corporation for payment of an amount equal to
the fair market value of each dissenting share multiplied by the number of dissenting shares which any dissenting shareholder who is a
party, or who has intervened, is entitled to require the corporation to purchase, with interest thereon at the legal rate from the date on which
judgment was entered.

        (d)   Any such judgment shall be payable forthwith with respect to uncertificated securities and, with respect to certificated securities,
only upon the endorsement and delivery to the corporation of the certificates for the shares described in the judgment. Any party may
appeal from the judgment.

        (e)   The costs of the action, including reasonable compensation to the appraisers to be fixed by the court, shall be assessed or
apportioned as the court considers equitable, but, if the appraisal exceeds the price offered by the corporation, the corporation shall pay the
costs (including in the discretion of the court attorneys' fees, fees of expert witnesses and interest at the legal rate on judgments from the
date of compliance with Sections 1300, 1301 and 1302 if the value awarded by the court for the shares is more than 125 percent of the
price offered by the corporation under subdivision (a) of Section 1301).

1306. Prevention of immediate payment; status as creditors; interest 

        To the extent that the provisions of Chapter 5 prevent the payment to any holders of dissenting shares of their fair market value, they
shall become creditors of the corporation for the amount thereof together with interest at the legal rate on judgments until the date of
payment, but subordinate to all

1307. Dividends on dissenting shares 

        Cash dividends declared and paid by the corporation upon the dissenting shares after the date of approval of the reorganization by the
outstanding shares (Section 152) and prior to payment for the shares by the corporation shall be credited against the total amount to be
paid by the corporation therefor.

1308. Rights of dissenting shareholders pending valuation; withdrawal of demand for payment 

        Except as expressly limited in this chapter, holders of dissenting shares continue to have all the rights and privileges incident to their
shares, until the fair market value of their shares is agreed upon or determined. A dissenting shareholder may not withdraw a demand for
payment unless the corporation consents thereto.

1309. Termination of dissenting share and shareholder status 

        Dissenting shares lose their status as dissenting shares and the holders thereof cease to be dissenting shareholders and cease to be
entitled to require the corporation to purchase their shares upon the happening of any of the following:

        (a)   The corporation abandons the reorganization. Upon abandonment of the reorganization, the corporation shall pay on demand to
any dissenting shareholder who has initiated proceedings in good faith under this chapter all necessary expenses incurred in such
proceedings and reasonable attorneys' fees.

        (b)   The shares are transferred prior to their submission for endorsement in accordance with Section 1302 or are surrendered for
conversion into shares of another class in accordance with the articles.

        (c)   The dissenting shareholder and the corporation do not agree upon the status of the shares as dissenting shares or upon the
purchase price of the shares, and neither files a complaint or intervenes in a pending action as provided in Section 1304, within six months
after the date on which notice of the approval by the outstanding shares or notice pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1110 was mailed to
the shareholder.

        (d)   The dissenting shareholder, with the consent of the corporation, withdraws the shareholder's demand for purchase of the
dissenting shares.

1310. Suspension of right to compensation or valuation proceedings; litigation of shareholders' approval 

        If litigation is instituted to test the sufficiency or regularity of the votes of the shareholders in authorizing a reorganization, any
proceedings under Sections 1304 and 1305 shall be suspended until final determination of such litigation.

1311. Exempt shares 

        This chapter, except Section 1312, does not apply to classes of shares whose terms and provisions specifically set forth the amount to
be paid in respect to such shares in the event of a reorganization or merger.

1312. Right of dissenting shareholder to attack, set aside or rescind merger or reorganization; restraining order or injunction;
conditions 

        (a)   No shareholder of a corporation who has a right under this chapter to demand payment of cash for the shares held by the
shareholder shall have any right at law or in equity to attack the validity of the reorganization or short-form merger, or to have the
reorganization or short-form merger set aside or rescinded, except in an action to test whether the number of shares required to authorize or
approve the reorganization have been legally voted in favor thereof; but any holder of shares of a class whose terms and provisions
specifically set forth the amount to be paid in respect to them in the event of a reorganization or short-form merger is entitled to payment
in accordance with those terms and provisions or, if the principal terms of the reorganization are approved pursuant to subdivision (b) of
Section 1202, is entitled to payment in accordance with the terms and provisions of the approved reorganization.

        (b)   If one of the parties to a reorganization or short-form merger is directly or indirectly controlled by, or under common control
with, another party to the reorganization or short-form merger, subdivision (a) shall not apply to any shareholder of such party who has not
demanded payment of cash for such shareholder's shares pursuant to this chapter; but if the shareholder institutes any action to attack the
validity of the reorganization or short-form merger or to have the reorganization or short-form merger set aside or rescinded, the
shareholder shall not thereafter have any right to demand payment of cash for the shareholder's shares pursuant to this chapter. The court in
any action attacking the validity of the reorganization or short-form merger or to have the reorganization or short-form merger set aside or
rescinded shall not restrain or enjoin the consummation of the transaction except upon 10 days' prior notice to the corporation and upon a
determination by the court that clearly no other remedy will adequately protect the complaining shareholder or the class of shareholders of
which such shareholder is a member.

        (c)   If one of the parties to a reorganization or short-form merger is directly or indirectly controlled by, or under common control
with, another party to the reorganization or short-form merger, in any action to attack the validity of the reorganization or short-form
merger or to have the reorganization or short-form merger set aside or rescinded, (1) a party to a reorganization or short-form merger
which controls another party to the reorganization or short-form merger shall have the burden of proving that the transaction is just and
reasonable as to the shareholders of the controlled party, and (2) a person who controls two or more parties to a reorganization shall have
the burden of proving that the transaction is just and reasonable as to the shareholders of any party so controlled.

§ 1313. Conversions deemed to constitute a reorganization; application of chapter 

        A conversion pursuant to Chapter 11.5 (commencing with Section 1150) shall be deemed to constitute a reorganization for purposes
of applying the provisions of this chapter, in accordance with and to the extent provided in Section 1159.

Appendix D 

Opinion of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. 

April 5, 2017

The Board of Directors
CU Bancorp
818 West 7th Street, Suite 220
Los Angeles, CA 90017

Members of the Board:

        You have requested the opinion of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. ("KBW" or "we") as investment bankers as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the common shareholders of CU Bancorp ("CU Bancorp") of the Merger Consideration (as defined below) to be
received by such shareholders in the proposed merger (the "Merger") of CU Bancorp with and into PacWest Bancorp ("PacWest"),
pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") to be entered into by and between CU Bancorp and PacWest. Pursuant to
the Agreement and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth therein, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of any person, including without limitation CU Bancorp, PacWest, any holder of
shares of common stock, no par value per share, of CU Bancorp ("CU Bancorp Common Stock") or any holder of shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of PacWest ("PacWest Common Stock"), each share of CU Bancorp Common Stock (excluding Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares (each as defined in the Agreement)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
become and be converted into the right to receive: (i) $12.00 in cash (the "Cash Consideration") and (ii) 0.5308 of a share of PacWest
Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration"). The Stock Consideration and Cash Consideration, taken together, are referred to herein as the
"Merger Consideration." The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

        The Agreement further provides that, immediately after the Merger, California United Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CU
Bancorp, shall merge with and into Pacific Western Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PacWest ("Pacific Western Bank"), with Pacific
Western Bank as the surviving entity (such transaction, the "Bank Merger"). In addition, with the consent of CU Bancorp, we have
assumed in connection with certain of our analyses the purchase by CU Bancorp of all of its Series A Preferred Stock (as defined in the
Agreement) concurrently with or prior to the closing of the Merger, with funds to be provided by CU Bancorp, as more fully described in
the Agreement and as further described to us by representatives of CU Bancorp (the "Preferred Stock Purchase").

        KBW has acted as financial advisor to CU Bancorp and not as an advisor to or agent of any other person. As part of our investment
banking business, we are continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in connection with
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for
various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, we have experience in, and knowledge of, the valuation of
banking enterprises. We and our affiliates, in the ordinary course of our and their broker-dealer businesses, and further to certain existing
sales and trading relationships with each of CU Bancorp and PacWest, may from time to time purchase securities from, and sell securities
to, CU Bancorp and PacWest. In addition, as a market maker in securities, we and our affiliates may from time to time have a long or short
position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of CU

Bancorp or PacWest for our and their own accounts and for the accounts of our and their respective customers and clients. We have acted
exclusively for the board of directors of CU Bancorp (the "Board") in rendering this opinion and will receive a fee from CU Bancorp for
our services. A portion of our fee is payable upon the rendering of this opinion, and a significant portion is contingent upon the successful
completion of the Merger. In addition, CU Bancorp has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement.

        Other than this present engagement, in the past two years, KBW has not provided investment banking and financial advisory services
to CU Bancorp. In the past two years, KBW has not provided investment banking and financial advisory services to PacWest. We may in
the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to CU Bancorp or PacWest and receive compensation for such
services.

        In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating
condition of CU Bancorp and PacWest and bearing upon the Merger, including among other things, the following: (i) a draft of the
Agreement dated April 4, 2017 (the most recent draft made available to us); (ii) the audited financial statements and the Annual Reports on
Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 of CU Bancorp; (iii) the audited financial statements and Annual Reports
on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 of PacWest; (iv) certain regulatory filings of CU Bancorp and PacWest
and their respective subsidiaries, including the quarterly reports on Form FR Y-9C and call reports filed with respect to each quarter during
the three year period ended December 31, 2016; (v) certain other interim reports and other communications of CU Bancorp and PacWest
to their respective shareholders; and (vi) other financial information concerning the businesses and operations of CU Bancorp and PacWest
that was furnished to us by CU Bancorp and PacWest or which we were otherwise directed to use for purposes of our analyses. Our
consideration of financial information and other factors that we deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to our analyses
included, among others, the following: (i) the historical and current financial position and results of operations of CU Bancorp and
PacWest; (ii) the assets and liabilities of CU Bancorp and PacWest; (iii) the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and
business combinations in the banking industry; (iv) a comparison of certain financial and stock market information for CU Bancorp and
PacWest with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; (v) publicly available consensus
"street estimates" of CU Bancorp for 2017 and 2018, as well as assumed long-term CU Bancorp growth rates provided to us by CU
Bancorp management, all of which information was discussed with us by such management and used and relied upon by us at the direction
of CU Bancorp management and with the consent of the Board; (vi) publicly available consensus "street estimates" of PacWest for 2017
and 2018, as well as assumed long- term PacWest growth rates that were discussed with us by PacWest management and used and relied
upon by us based on such discussions, at the direction of CU Bancorp management and with the consent of the Board; and (vii) estimates
regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the Merger on PacWest (including, without limitation, the cost savings and related
expenses expected to result or be derived from the Merger) that were prepared by, and provided to and discussed with us by, the
management of PacWest, and used and relied upon by us based on such discussions, at the direction of CU Bancorp management and with
the consent of the Board. We have also performed such other studies and analyses as we considered appropriate and have taken into
account our assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and our experience in other transactions, as well as our
experience in securities valuation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. We have also participated in discussions with the
managements of CU Bancorp and PacWest regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial condition and
future prospects of their respective companies and such other matters as we have deemed relevant to our inquiry. In addition, we have
considered the results of the efforts undertaken, with our assistance, by or on behalf of and at the direction of CU Bancorp, to solicit
indications of interest from third parties regarding a potential transaction with CU Bancorp.

        In conducting our review and arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information that was provided to us or that was publicly available and we have not independently verified the accuracy
or completeness of any such information or assumed any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. We
have relied upon the management of CU Bancorp as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus "street
estimates" of CU Bancorp and the assumed CU Bancorp long-term growth rates referred to above, and we have assumed that such
information was reasonably prepared and represents, or in the case of the publicly available consensus "street estimates" of CU Bancorp
that such information is consistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of CU Bancorp management and that such
forecasts, projections and estimates will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods currently estimated. We have further relied,
with the consent of CU Bancorp, upon PacWest management as to the reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus
"street estimates" of PacWest and the assumed PacWest long-term growth rates referred to above, as well as the estimates regarding certain
pro forma financial effects of the Merger on PacWest (and the assumptions and bases therefor, including without limitation the cost
savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the Merger) referred to above, and we have assumed, with the consent
of CU Bancorp, that such information was reasonably prepared and represents, or in the case of the publicly available consensus "street
estimates" of PacWest that such information is consistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of PacWest
management and that such forecasts, projections and estimates will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods currently estimated.

        It is understood that the forecasts, projections and estimates of CU Bancorp and PacWest provided to us were not prepared with the
expectation of public disclosure and that such information, together with the publicly available consensus "street estimates" of CU
Bancorp and PacWest referred to above that we were directed to use, is based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently
uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and that, accordingly, actual results
could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. We have assumed, based on discussions with the respective
managements of CU Bancorp and PacWest and with the consent of the Board, that all such information provides a reasonable basis upon
which we could form our opinion and we express no view as to any such information or the assumptions or bases therefor. We have relied
on all such information without independent verification or analysis and do not in any respect assume any responsibility or liability for the
accuracy or completeness thereof.

        We also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business or
prospects of either CU Bancorp or PacWest since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made available to
us. We are not experts in the independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for loan and lease losses and we have assumed,
without independent verification and with your consent, that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for CU Bancorp and
PacWest are adequate to cover such losses. In rendering our opinion, we have not made or obtained any evaluations or appraisals or
physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of CU Bancorp or PacWest, the collateral securing any of
such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor have we examined any individual loan or credit files, nor did we
evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of CU Bancorp or PacWest under any state or federal laws, including those relating
to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily
reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, we
assume no responsibility or liability for their accuracy.

        We have assumed, in all respects material to our analyses, the following: (i) that the Merger will be completed substantially in
accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement (the final terms of which we have assumed will not differ in any respect material to
our analyses from the draft reviewed

and referred to above) with no adjustments to the Merger Consideration and with no additional payments in respect of the CU Bancorp
Common Stock; (ii) that any related transactions (including the Bank Merger and the Preferred Stock Purchase) will be completed as
contemplated in the Agreement and as further described to us by representatives of CU Bancorp; (iii) that the representations and
warranties of each party in the Agreement and in all related documents and instruments referred to in the Agreement are true and correct;
(iv) that each party to the Agreement and all related documents will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed
by such party under such documents; (v) that there are no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions, any necessary
regulatory or governmental approval for the Merger or any related transactions (including the Bank Merger and the Preferred Stock
Purchase) and that all conditions to the completion of the Merger and any related transaction will be satisfied without any waivers or
modifications to the Agreement or any of the related documents; and (vi) that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory,
contractual, or other consents or approvals for the Merger and any related transaction (including the Bank Merger and the Preferred Stock
Purchase), no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, will be
imposed that will have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of CU Bancorp, PacWest or the
pro forma entity, or the contemplated benefits of the Merger, including without limitation the cost savings and related expenses expected to
result or be derived from the Merger. We have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in a manner that complies with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable
federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. We have further been advised by representatives of CU Bancorp that CU Bancorp has
relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and
regulatory matters with respect to CU Bancorp, PacWest, the Merger and any related transaction (including the Bank Merger and the
Preferred Stock Purchase), and the Agreement. KBW has not provided advice with respect to any such matters.

        This opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date hereof, to the holders of CU Bancorp Common
Stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger. We express no view or opinion as to any other terms or
aspects of the Merger or any term or aspect of any related transaction (including the Bank Merger and the Preferred Stock Purchase),
including without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger (including the form of Merger Consideration or the allocation thereof
between cash and stock) or any related transaction, any consequences of the Merger or any related transaction to CU Bancorp, its
shareholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or implications of any employment, consulting, voting, support,
shareholder or other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered into in connection with the Merger or otherwise.
Our opinion is necessarily based upon conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on the date hereof and the information made available
to us through the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent developments may affect the conclusion reached in this opinion and that
KBW does not have an obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion does not address, and we express no view or
opinion with respect to, (i) the underlying business decision of CU Bancorp to engage in the Merger or enter into the Agreement; (ii) the
relative merits of the Merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been or may be available to or contemplated by CU
Bancorp or the Board; (iii) the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of CU Bancorp's officers, directors or
employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the compensation to the holders of CU Bancorp Common Stock; (iv) the effect of the
Merger or any related transaction on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any class of securities of CU
Bancorp (other than the holders of CU Bancorp Common Stock solely with respect to the Merger Consideration, as described herein and
not relative to the consideration to be received by holders of any other class of securities) or holders of any class of securities of PacWest
or any other party to any transaction contemplated by the Agreement; (v) whether PacWest has

adjustment (as provided in the Agreement) to the Merger Consideration assumed for purposes of our opinion; (viii) the actual value of
PacWest Common Stock to be issued in the Merger; (ix) the prices, trading range or volume at which CU Bancorp Common Stock or
PacWest Common Stock will trade following the public announcement of the Merger or the prices, trading range or volume at which
PacWest Common Stock will trade following the consummation of the Merger; (x) any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor
to any of the parties to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Agreement; or (xi) any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or
similar matters relating to CU Bancorp, PacWest, their respective shareholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the
Merger or any related transaction (including the Bank Merger and the Preferred Stock Purchase), including whether or not the Merger
would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes.

        This opinion is for the information of, and is directed to, the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the
financial terms of the Merger. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board as to how it should vote on the Merger, or
to any holder of CU Bancorp Common Stock or any shareholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the Merger or any
other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation regarding whether or not any such shareholder should enter into a voting,
shareholders', or affiliates' agreement with respect to the Merger or exercise any dissenters' or appraisal rights that may be available to
such shareholder.

        This opinion has been reviewed and approved by our Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with our policies and procedures
established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to be received by the
holders of CU Bancorp Common Stock in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

  Very truly yours,
