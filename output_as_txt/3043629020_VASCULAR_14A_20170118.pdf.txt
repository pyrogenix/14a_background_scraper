January 18, 2017

To Our Shareholders:

You are invited to attend a special meeting of the shareholders of Vascular Solutions, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (which we
refer to as “Vascular Solutions,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), which we will hold at 6401 Sycamore Court North, Maple
Grove, Minnesota, on Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. local time. We refer to such meeting, including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, as the “special meeting.”

At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve and adopt the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of December 1, 2016 (as it may be amended from time to time, which we refer to as the “merger agreement”), by
and among Vascular Solutions, Teleflex Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (which we refer to as “Teleflex”), and Violet Merger
Sub Inc., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Teleflex (which we refer to as “Merger Sub”), pursuant to
which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Vascular Solutions (which we refer to as the “merger”), the separate existence of
Merger Sub will cease, and Vascular Solutions will continue as the surviving company. You will also be asked to consider and vote
on (1) a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (2) a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

If the merger agreement is adopted and the merger is completed, Vascular Solutions will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Teleflex, and, at the effective time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger (other than shares owned by Merger Sub, Teleflex or any wholly owned subsidiary of Teleflex or of Vascular
Solutions immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, which will be converted into shares of common stock of the
surviving company, and any dissenting shares) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of
$56.00 per share in cash, without interest.

Our board of directors has unanimously adopted resolutions (i) declaring the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (ii)
approving and declaring advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, (iii) recommending that the Company’s shareholders approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement and (iv)
directing that the approval of the merger and the adoption of the plan of merger be submitted to the shareholders of the Company.
Accordingly, our board unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Vascular Solutions vote (1) “FOR” the proposal to
approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement, (2) “FOR” the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Vascular Solutions in connection with the
merger, and (3) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional
proxies or in the absence of a quorum.

Your vote is very important. The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our
common stock entitled to be cast on the proposal vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger
agreement. A failure to vote your shares of our common stock on the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger
agreement will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement.

The attached proxy statement provides you with detailed information about the special meeting, the merger agreement
and the merger. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this document. We encourage you to read this
document and the merger agreement carefully and in their entirety. You may also obtain more information about Vascular
Solutions from documents we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See “Where You Can Find Additional
Information.”

stock. If your shares are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to present a recent brokerage
statement or letter from such entity reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date. If you do not provide photo
identification or comply with the other procedures outlined in this document, you will not be admitted to the special meeting. For
security reasons, you and your bags may be subject to search prior to your admittance to the meeting.

Purpose of the Special Meeting. At the special meeting, you will be asked (1) to consider and vote on the proposal to
approve the merger and adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 1, 2016, by and among Vascular
Solutions, Teleflex, and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Vascular Solutions; (2) to
consider and vote on the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or
become payable to Vascular Solutions’ named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) to consider and vote on
the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies
if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the
merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

Who Can Vote at the Meeting. You can vote at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, all of the shares of our common
stock you own of record as of January 13, 2017, which is the record date for the special meeting. If you own shares that are
registered in someone else’s name, for example, a broker, you need to direct that person to vote those shares or obtain a legal
proxy from them and vote the shares yourself at the meeting. As of January 13, 2017, there were 17,568,375 shares of our
common stock outstanding held by approximately 142 holders of record.

What Vote is Required for Approval of the Merger Agreement. Approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement
requires that shareholders holding a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record
date for the special meeting and entitled to be cast on such proposal vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt
the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of our common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in “street
name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, such failure to
instruct your nominee will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger
agreement.

Quorum. A quorum will be present if holders of record of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding on the
close of business on the record date are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a quorum is not
present at the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.

Procedure for Voting. You can vote shares you hold of record by attending the special meeting and voting in person or by
mailing the enclosed proxy card or voting by telephone or through the internet. If your shares are held in “street name” by a
broker, bank or other nominee, you should instruct such nominee on how to vote your shares using the instructions provided by
such nominee. If you do not instruct such nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the merger agreement.

How to Revoke Your Proxy. You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the
special meeting. To revoke your proxy, you must (a) submit a new proxy with a more recent date than that of the first proxy by
(1) following the internet voting instructions, (2) following the telephone voting instructions or (3) completing, signing, dating
and returning a new proxy card to us, which must be received by us before the time of the special meeting; or (b) if you are a
registered shareholder, attending the meeting in person and delivering a proper written notice of revocation of your proxy.
Attendance at the special meeting will not by itself revoke a previously granted proxy. Unless you decide to vote your shares in
person, you should revoke your prior proxy in the same way you initially submitted it—that is, by internet, telephone or mail.

connection with the potential sale of Vascular Solutions. Guggenheim Securities delivered an opinion to our board to the effect
that, as of December 1, 2016 and based on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made
and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken, the consideration to be received in connection with the
merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of our common stock (excluding (i) any wholly owned subsidiary
of Vascular Solutions or (ii) Teleflex, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates). The full text of Guggenheim Securities’ written
opinion, which is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and which you should read carefully and in its entirety, is subject
to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other conditions contained in such opinion and is necessarily based on
economic, capital markets and other conditions, and the information made available to Guggenheim Securities, as of the date of
such opinion.

Guggenheim Securities’ opinion was provided to our board (in its capacity as such) for its information and assistance in
connection with its evaluation of the consideration to be received in connection with the merger. Guggenheim Securities’ opinion
and any materials provided in connection therewith did not constitute a recommendation to our board with respect to the merger,
nor does Guggenheim Securities’ opinion constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of our common stock as to how to
vote or act in connection with the merger or otherwise. Guggenheim Securities’ opinion addresses only the fairness, from a
financial point of view and as of the date of such opinion, of the consideration to be received in connection with the merger by
holders of our common stock (excluding (i) any wholly owned subsidiary of Vascular Solutions or (ii) Teleflex, Merger Sub and
their respective affiliates) to the extent expressly specified in such opinion and does not address any other term, aspect or
implication of the merger, the merger agreement (including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger) or any other
agreement, transaction document or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or to be entered into or amended in
connection with the merger or any financing or other transactions related thereto.

For a description of the opinion that our board received from Guggenheim Securities, see “The Merger— Opinion of
Vascular Solutions’ Financial Advisor.”

Certain Effects of the Merger on Vascular Solutions (page 22)

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Vascular Solutions, with Vascular
Solutions surviving the merger. Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term “surviving company” to refer to Vascular
Solutions as the surviving company following the merger. If the merger is consummated, you will not own any shares of the
capital stock of the surviving company.

The time at which the merger will become effective, which we refer to as the effective time of the merger, will occur at the
time the articles of merger are duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota or at such later time on the closing
date as may be agreed by Vascular Solutions and Merger Sub and specified in the articles of merger.

Effect on Vascular Solutions if the Merger is Not Completed (page 22)

If the merger agreement is not approved by our shareholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, our
shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, the
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, a listing tier of The Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC, referred to as “Nasdaq,” and registered under the U.S.

Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, referred to as the “Exchange Act,” and we will continue to file periodic reports with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, referred to as the “SEC.” Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay
Teleflex a termination fee upon or following the termination of the merger agreement, as described in the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement—Termination Fee.”

When the Merger Becomes Effective; Marketing Period (page 53)

The merger agreement provides that the closing of the merger will occur within two business days after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the merger, provided, that if the marketing period has not ended at such time, the closing of the merger
will occur on the earlier of (i) a date during the marketing period specified by Teleflex in writing on no fewer than two business
days’ notice to Vascular Solutions, which may be conditioned upon the simultaneous completion of the debt financing and (ii) the
second business day following the last day of the marketing period.

The “marketing period” refers to the first period of 15 consecutive business days beginning on the date Teleflex receives
certain required information and throughout which certain conditions to the closing of the merger are satisfied, subject to certain
other timing restrictions and conditions described in further detail in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—When the
Merger Becomes Effective; Marketing Period.”

As of the date of this document, the parties expect to complete the merger during the first half of 2017. However, completion
of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the merger, and factors outside the
control of Vascular Solutions or Teleflex may delay the completion of the merger, or prevent it from being completed at all. In
addition, Teleflex is not required to complete the merger until after the completion of the marketing period. There can be no
assurances as to whether or when the merger will be completed.

Treatment of Vascular Solutions Equity Awards and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (page 55)

Restricted Stock. At the effective time, each share of our common stock issued under our equity compensation plans, and
then-subject to restrictions of forfeiture under our equity compensation plans, will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax).

Stock Options. At the effective time, each option to purchase our common stock, referred to as a “stock option,” that is
outstanding, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to
deduction for any applicable withholding tax) equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of our common stock subject
to such stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (y) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the
exercise price per share of such stock option.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Vascular Solutions Employee Stock Purchase Plan, referred to as the “ESPP,” has been
amended such that (i) participation following the date of the merger agreement will be limited to those employees who are
participating in the ESPP as of such date; (ii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the ESPP, participants may
not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of the merger agreement; (iii) no
offering period will be commenced after the date of the merger agreement; (iv) each participant’s outstanding right to purchase
shares of our common stock under the ESPP will terminate on the day immediately prior to the day on which the effective time of
the merger occurs; provided that amounts allocated to each participant’s account under the ESPP as of such date will be used to
purchase shares of common stock using such date as the final purchase date; and (v) the ESPP will terminate immediately
following the purchase of such shares.

No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals (page 59)

The merger agreement restricts our ability to solicit or engage in discussions or negotiations with a third party regarding
competing transactions and our board’s ability to change or withdraw its recommendation in favor of the merger agreement.
Notwithstanding these restrictions, subject to the procedures set forth in the merger agreement, our board may respond to written
competing proposals, withdraw its recommendation in favor of the merger agreement and terminate the merger agreement in
order to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Change in Board Recommendation (page 60)

Our board unanimously recommends that our shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the
merger agreement. Nevertheless, our board may make a change of recommendation or terminate the merger agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal (as defined in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—No
Solicitation; Alternative Proposals”) if, subject to the procedures set forth in the merger agreement, Vascular Solutions receives
an unsolicited, written competing proposal that our board, after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors, concludes
constitutes a superior proposal (taking into account any offers made by Teleflex to adjust the terms of the merger agreement) or if,
subject to the procedures set forth in the merger agreement, there has been an intervening event unrelated to a competing proposal
and, in any event, failure to take such action would be inconsistent with our board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Interests of Vascular Solutions’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 47)

When considering the recommendation by our board in favor of the merger agreement and the merger, you should be aware
that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours, including the
following:

• payments in connection with unvested stock options and shares of restricted stock at the closing of the merger, as
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Vascular Solutions Equity Awards;”

• the entitlement of certain of our executive officers to receive severance payments and benefits under their respective
executive employment agreements in the event the executive officer’s employment is terminated on or following
shareholder approval of the merger either by the surviving company without cause or by the executive officer for good
reason; and

• continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the surviving company.

See the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Interests of Vascular Solutions’ Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger.”

If the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement is approved by our shareholders and the merger
closes, any shares of our common stock held by our directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as
outstanding shares of our common stock held by all of our other shareholders (other than dissenting shares or cancelled shares).

The members of our board were aware of these interests of Vascular Solutions’ directors and executive officers and
considered them, among other matters, when approving the merger agreement and the merger and determining to recommend that
its shareholders vote “FOR” the approval of the merger agreement and the merger.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 50)

If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”), the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will
generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable
state, local or foreign income or other tax laws. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular tax
consequences to you of the exchange of shares of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger in light of your particular
circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws).

Regulatory Approvals (page 51)

Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, referred to as the “HSR Act,” and the rules
promulgated thereunder, the merger may not be completed until notifications have been given and information furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, referred to as the “Antitrust Division,” and the United States
Federal Trade Commission, referred to as the “FTC,” and all

their respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC. The 30-day waiting period under the
HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 17, 2017.

Financing of the Merger (page 46)

While Teleflex’s obligations under the merger agreement are not subject to any financing condition, Teleflex has entered into
a debt commitment letter, referred to as the “commitment letter,” with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., referred to as “JPMorgan,”
dated December 1, 2016, which was amended and restated on December 20, 2016 to add Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith and PNC Bank, National Association, referred to collectively, together with JPMorgan, as the
“commitment parties,” as additional commitment parties and lead arrangers. Pursuant to the commitment letter, the commitment
parties have committed (i) to provide a $750 million senior unsecured bridge facility and (ii) to backstop an amendment to
Teleflex’s existing credit agreement, dated July 16, 2013, with the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan as administrative agent,
referred to as the “existing credit agreement,” in order to permit the bridge facility and to make certain other changes to the
existing credit agreement, collectively referred to as the “debt financing.”

written notice of such breach or failure; or

plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of the merger agreement (excluding
Vascular Solutions stock plans and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan);

• from the effective time through December 31, 2017, Teleflex will, or will cause the surviving company to, provide each
continuing employee with base salary (or wages) and annual cash bonus opportunities that, in each case, are no less
favorable than those provided by Vascular Solutions immediately prior to the effective time;

• from the effective time through December 31, 2017, Teleflex will, or will cause the surviving company to, provide each

pension or other retirement plans and any severance or health or welfare plans (other than for purposes of determining
any accrued benefit under any defined benefit pension plan or as would result in a duplication of benefits);

requirements or pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions will apply with respect to the continuing employees
under the applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Teleflex or any affiliate of Teleflex (except to the extent
applicable under Vascular Solutions’ benefit plans immediately prior to the effective time), (ii) waive any and all
evidence of insurability requirements with respect to such continuing employees to the extent such evidence of
insurability requirements were not applicable to the continuing employees under the Vascular Solutions benefit plans
immediately prior to the effective time and (iii) credit each continuing employee with all deductible payments, out-of-
pocket or other co-payments paid by such employee under the Vascular Solutions benefit plans prior to the closing date
during the year in which the closing of the merger occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such

health benefit plan of Teleflex or an affiliate of Teleflex for such year; and

full account balance (including loans) distributed to such continuing employees from the Vascular Solutions 401(k)
plans to Teleflex’s or the surviving company’s applicable 401(k) plan.

Market Prices and Dividend Data (page 71)

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER

The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special meeting and the
proposals to be voted on at the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all of the questions that may be
important to you as a shareholder of Vascular Solutions. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this
document, the annexes to this document and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this document, which we urge
you to read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this document without
charge by following the instructions under the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

Q: Why am I receiving this document?

A: On December 1, 2016, Vascular Solutions entered into a definitive agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Teleflex, with and into Vascular Solutions, with Vascular Solutions surviving the merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Teleflex. You are receiving this document in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board in
favor of the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement and a proposal to adjourn the meeting, if necessary
or appropriate, and to approve the other related proposal to be voted on at the special meeting.

Q: What is a proxy?

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of our common stock. The
written document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The
document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock is called a “proxy card.” Our board has
designated Howard Root and Gordon Weber, and each of them with full power of substitution, as proxies for the special
meeting.

Q: When and where is the special meeting?

A: The special meeting will be held at 6401 Sycamore Court North, Maple Grove, Minnesota, on Thursday, February 16, 2017, at
9:00 a.m. local time (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “special meeting”).

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?

A: Only holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on January 13, 2017, the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to receive these proxy materials and to vote their shares at the special meeting. As of the close of business
on the record date, there were 17,568,375 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting,
held by 142 holders of record. Each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date will be entitled to
one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at the special meeting.

Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?

A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, you are
considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “shareholder of record.” In this case, we have sent this proxy statement and
your proxy card to you directly.

If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of the shares of our
common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other
nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the shareholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the
right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You
are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your
shares in person at the special meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank or other
nominee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What matters will be voted on at the special meeting?

A: You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

• to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement;

• to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of Vascular Solutions in connection with the merger; and

• to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement or
in the absence of a quorum.

Q: What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Vascular Solutions?

A: The proposed merger is the acquisition of Vascular Solutions by Teleflex pursuant to the merger agreement. If the proposal to
approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement is approved by the holders of our common stock and the other closing
conditions under the merger agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Vascular Solutions,
with Vascular Solutions continuing as the surviving company. As a result of the merger, Vascular Solutions will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Teleflex. We will cooperate with Teleflex to de-list our common stock from Nasdaq and de-register
under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the effective time of the merger, and at such time, we will
no longer be a publicly traded company and will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the merger is consummated,
you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving company.

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?

A: If the merger agreement is not approved by our shareholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, our
shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, the
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to
file periodic reports with the SEC.

Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Teleflex a termination fee upon the termination of the merger
agreement, as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees.”

Q: What will I receive if the merger is completed?

A: Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per-share merger consideration of $56.00 in cash, without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock that you own. For example, if you own 100
shares of common stock, you will receive $5,600.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, less any applicable
withholding taxes. Upon completion of the merger, you will not own shares in the surviving company.

Q: What will the holders of Vascular Solutions equity awards receive in the merger?

A: Restricted Stock. At the effective time, each share of our common stock issued under our equity compensation plans, and then-
subject to restrictions of forfeiture under our equity compensation plans, will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax).

Stock Options. At the effective time, each option to purchase our common stock, referred to as a “stock option,” that is
outstanding, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to
deduction for any applicable withholding tax) equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of our common stock
subject to such stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (y) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over
the exercise price per share of such stock option.

Q: What will happen to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan?

A: The Vascular Solutions Employee Stock Purchase Plan, referred to as the “ESPP,” will be amended such that (i) participation
following the date of the merger agreement will be limited to those employees who are

participating in the ESPP as of such date; (ii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the ESPP, participants may
not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of the merger agreement; (iii) no
offering period will be commenced after the date of the merger agreement; (iv) each participant’s outstanding right to purchase
shares of our common stock under the ESPP will terminate on the day immediately prior to the day on which the effective time
of the merger occurs; provided that amounts allocated to each participant’s account under the ESPP as of such date will be used
to purchase shares of common stock using such date as the final purchase date; and (v) the ESPP will terminate immediately
following the purchase of such shares.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A: We are working toward completing the merger as soon as possible, and currently expect to consummate the merger during the
first half of 2017. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to
conditions, including approval of the merger agreement by our shareholders and the receipt of regulatory approvals. See the
section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger.” In addition, Teleflex is not required to
complete the merger until after the completion of the marketing period.

The “marketing period” refers to the first period of 15 consecutive business days beginning on the date Teleflex receives
certain required information and throughout which certain conditions to the closing of the merger are satisfied, subject to
certain other timing restrictions and conditions described in further detail in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—
When the Merger Becomes Effective; Marketing Period.”

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal or dissenters’ rights under Minnesota Law?

A: Yes. As a holder of the Company’s common stock, you are entitled to exercise dissenters’ rights under the Minnesota Business
Corporation Act in connection with the merger if you take certain actions and meet certain conditions. See the section entitled
“Dissenters’ Rights.”

Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger?

A: If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger generally will require a U.S.
holder to recognize a gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the
amount of cash received by such U.S. holder pursuant to the merger and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of
our common stock surrendered pursuant to the merger. Backup withholding may also apply to the cash payment pursuant to the
merger unless the U.S. holder or other payee provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies that such number is correct
and otherwise complies with the backup withholding rules. Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that
you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your
own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A
more complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided under the section entitled
“The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

Q: How do I attend the special meeting?

A: To attend the meeting, you will need to present valid photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, and proof of
ownership of our common stock. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to
present a recent brokerage statement or letter from such entity reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date. If you do
not provide photo identification or comply with the other procedures outlined in this document, you will not be admitted to the
special meeting. For security reasons, you and your bags may be subject to search prior to your admittance to the meeting.

If you are not a holder of record as of the record date or a beneficial holder of common stock held in “street name,” you may be
admitted to the meeting only if you have a valid legal proxy from a holder of record as of the record date. You must present that
proxy, as well as a form of valid photo identification, at the entrance to the meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?

A: A quorum will be present if holders of record of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding on the close of
business on the record date are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at
the special meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.

If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your
shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote
your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote on your behalf with respect to any of the proposals, and your
shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the
special meeting.

Q: What vote of Vascular Solutions shareholders is required to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement?

A: Approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement requires that shareholders holding a majority of the shares of our
common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date for the special meeting and entitled to be cast on such
proposal vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of our
common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the
merger and adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee and
you do not instruct the nominee how to vote your shares, such failure to instruct your nominee will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement.

Q: What vote of Vascular Solutions shareholders is required to approve the other proposals to be voted upon at the special
meeting?

A: Each of the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of Vascular Solutions in connection with the merger and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum, requires that more shares are
voted “FOR” such proposal than “AGAINST.”

An abstention with respect to either proposal and a failure to vote your shares of our common stock on either proposal
(including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), assuming a quorum is present,
will not have the effect of either a vote “FOR” or a vote “AGAINST” such proposals.

Q: How does our board recommend that I vote?

A: Our board unanimously recommends that our shareholders vote:

• “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement;

• “FOR” the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger; and

• “FOR” the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting.

For a discussion of the factors that our board considered in determining to recommend the approval of the merger agreement,
please see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Reasons for our Board’s Recommendation in Favor of the Merger.”
In addition, in considering the recommendation of our board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that
some of our directors and executive officers have potential interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests
of our shareholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests
of Vascular Solutions’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What will happen if shareholders do not approve the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that
may be paid or become payable to Vascular Solutions’ named executive officers in connection with the merger?

A: The inclusion of this proposal is required by the SEC rules. However, the approval of this proposal is not a condition to the
completion of the merger and the vote on this proposal is an advisory vote by shareholders and is not binding on Vascular
Solutions or Teleflex. If the merger agreement is approved by Vascular Solutions shareholders and the merger is completed, the
merger-related compensation may be paid to Vascular Solutions’ named executive officers in accordance with the terms of their
compensation agreements and arrangements even if shareholders do not approve this proposal.

Q: What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of our common stock?

A: We urge you to read this entire document carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference, and to
consider how the merger affects you. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of our common stock you own.
See page i at the beginning of this proxy statement for instructions on how to vote your shares in person or by proxy over the
internet, by telephone or by mail.

Q: Can I revoke my proxy?

A: Yes. You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. To revoke
your proxy, you must (a) submit a new proxy with a more recent date than that of the first proxy by (1) following the internet
voting instructions, (2) following the telephone voting instructions or (3) completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy
card to us, which must be received by us before the time of the special meeting; or (b) if you are a registered shareholder,
attending the meeting in person and delivering a proper written notice of revocation of your proxy. Attendance at the special
meeting will not by itself revoke a previously granted proxy. Unless you decide to vote your shares in person, you should
revoke your prior proxy in the same way you initially submitted it—that is, by internet, telephone or mail.

Q: Will my shares of our common stock held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting
purposes with shares I hold of record?

A: No. Because any shares of our common stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different
shareholder (that is, your bank, broker or other financial nominee) than any shares of our common stock you hold of record,
any shares of our common stock held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of our common
stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares of our common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with
your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy
card for those shares of our common stock because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of our
common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title
or authority when completing and signing the proxy card. Shares of our common stock held in an individual retirement account
must be voted under the rules governing the account. This means that, to ensure all your shares are voted at the special meeting,
you should read carefully any proxy materials received and follow the instructions included therewith.

Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?

A: If your shares of our common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than
one proxy or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting instruction cards you receive
(or submit each of your proxies by telephone or the internet) to ensure that all of your shares of our common stock are voted.

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of our common stock before completion of the merger?

A: In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of our common stock through completion of the
merger. Consequently, if you transfer your shares of our common stock before completion of the merger, you will have
transferred your right to receive the merger consideration in the merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is on January 13, 2017, which is earlier than the
consummation of the merger. If you transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date but before the closing of the
merger, you will have the right to vote at the special meeting but not the right to receive the merger consideration.

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the
merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of our common stock evidenced by stock certificates for
the merger consideration. If your shares of our common stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee,
you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the
surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Do not send in your certificates now.

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?

A: We intend to issue a press release and announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a
Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC
are publicly available when filed. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

Q: Where can I find more information about Vascular Solutions?

A: You can find more information about us from various sources described in the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional
Information.”

materially from the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements.

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following factors:

conditions to the completion of the merger;

• the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances requiring us to pay Teleflex a termination fee of
$35 million;

• the risk of any event, change or other circumstances occurring that could give rise to the termination of the merger
agreement;

• the risk that Teleflex may be unable to access its financing or the failure of any such financing to be sufficient to
consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

• the risks that the proposed merger disrupts our current plans and operations or affects our ability to retain or recruit key
employees;

• the effect of the announcement or pendency of the merger on our business relationships (including, without limitation,
customers and suppliers), operating results and business generally;

• the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the merger agreement or the merger;

• the risks related to diverting management’s or employees’ attention from ongoing business operations;

• the risks associated with limitations placed on our ability to operate our business under the merger agreement;

• the risk that our stock price may decline significantly if the merger is not completed or may suffer as a result of
uncertainty surrounding the merger;

related to the merger and instituted against us and others;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are furnishing this document to Vascular Solutions shareholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by our board for use at
the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. This document provides Vascular Solutions shareholders with the
information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting

This document is being furnished to our shareholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by our board for use at the special
meeting to be held at 6401 Sycamore Court North, Maple Grove, Minnesota, on Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. local
time, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, which we refer to as the “special meeting.”

To attend the meeting, you will need to present valid photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, and proof of
ownership of our common stock. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to present a
recent brokerage statement or letter from such entity reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date.

If you are not a holder of record as of the record date or a beneficial holder of common stock held in “street name,” you may be
admitted to the meeting only if you have a valid legal proxy from a holder of record as of the record date. You must present that
proxy, as well as a form of valid photo identification, at the entrance to the meeting.

Purposes of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, Vascular Solutions shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

• to approve the merger with Merger Sub and adopt the merger agreement, dated as of December 1, 2016, by and among
Vascular Solutions, Teleflex and Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Teleflex;

• to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to Vascular
Solutions’ named executive officers in connection with the merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the
section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Vascular Solutions’ Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger;” and

• to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the
merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

Our shareholders must approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If our shareholders fail to
approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement, the merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this
document as Annex A, and the material provisions of the merger agreement are described in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement.”

The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to
approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a shareholder may vote to approve the executive compensation
and vote not to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement and vice versa. Because the vote on executive compensation is
advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either Vascular Solutions or Teleflex. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is
approved by Vascular Solutions shareholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to Vascular
Solutions’ executive officers even if the shareholders fail to approve the proposal.

Vascular Solutions does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. If any other matters are properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof for consideration, however, the holders of the proxies will have discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their
best judgment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Record Date and Quorum

The holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on January 13, 2017, the record date for the special
meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. At the close of business on the record date, 17,568,375
shares of our common stock were outstanding.

The presence at the special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of our common
stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum. Once a share is represented at the special
meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the special meeting. However, if a new record date is set for
an adjourned special meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be
included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the special meeting.

Required Vote

Each share of our common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on each of the
proposals to be considered at the special meeting.

For Vascular Solutions to complete the merger, Vascular Solutions shareholders holding a majority of the shares of our
common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date and entitled to vote on such proposal must vote “FOR” the
proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of our common stock or an abstention
from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement.

Approval of each of the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to
Vascular Solutions’ named executive officers in connection with the merger and the adjournment proposal requires that more shares
are voted “FOR” than “AGAINST” such proposal. An abstention with respect to either proposal and a failure to vote your shares of
our common stock (including a failure of your broker, bank or other nominee to vote shares held on your behalf), assuming a
quorum is present, will not have the effect of either a vote “FOR” or a vote “AGAINST” these proposals.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation

Attendance

All holders of shares of our common stock as of the close of business on January 13, 2017, the record date, including
shareholders of record and beneficial owners of our common stock registered in the “street name” of a broker, bank or other
nominee, are invited to attend the special meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, please be prepared to provide valid photo
identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, and proof of ownership of our common stock. If your shares are held in the
name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to present a recent brokerage statement or letter from such entity reflecting
your stock ownership as of the record date. If you do not provide photo identification or comply with the other procedures outlined
in this document, you will not be admitted to the special meeting. For security reasons, you and your bags may be subject to search
prior to your admittance to the meeting.

If you are not a holder of record as of the record date or a beneficial holder of common stock held in “street name,” you may be
admitted to the meeting only if you have a valid legal proxy from a holder of record as of the record date. You must present that
proxy, as well as a form of valid photo identification, at the entrance to the meeting.

Voting in Person

Shareholders of record will be able to vote in person at the special meeting. We will give you a ballot when you arrive. If you
are not a shareholder of record but instead hold your shares of our common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other
nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote
in person at the special meeting. Attending the meeting in person does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.

Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy

To ensure that your shares of our common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting
instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person.

To vote by telephone, dial 1-866-883-3382 from any touch-tone telephone and follow the instructions. Have your proxy card
available when you call. If you vote by telephone, please do not mail your proxy card.

To vote by mail, mark your proxy card, date and sign it and return it in the postage-prepaid envelope. You should not return
your stock certificate or send documents representing our common stock with the proxy card. If the merger is completed, the
paying agent for the merger will send you a letter of transmittal and related materials and instructions for exchanging your shares of
our common stock for the right to receive $56.00 in cash, without interest, referred to as the merger consideration.

If you vote by proxy over the internet or by telephone, your votes must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, the day before
the special meeting to be counted. If you vote by proxy by mail, your votes must be received prior to the special meeting to be
counted.

Your proxy card will count as a “vote” if you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote
with respect to a proposal. In this case, your proxy will be voted “FOR” such proposal.

A failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger and
adopt the merger agreement. An abstention and, assuming a quorum is present, a failure to vote will not have the effect of either a
vote “FOR” or a vote “AGAINST” on the other two proposals.

Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by
your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Without those
instructions, your shares will not be voted on any of the proposals, which will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the
proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement, but, assuming a quorum is present, will not have the effect of either
a vote “FOR” or a vote “AGAINST” on the other two proposals.

In accordance with the rules of Nasdaq, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of our common stock in “street
name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to (i) the proposal to approve the
merger and adopt the merger agreement, (ii) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid
or become payable to the named executive officers of Vascular Solutions in connection with the merger or (iii) the adjournment of
the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum. Accordingly, if
brokers, banks or other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not
vote such shares with respect to these proposals. Therefore, unless you attend the special meeting in person with a properly executed
legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will
result in your shares of our common stock not being present at the meeting and not being voted on any of the proposals.
Consequently, there cannot be any “broker non-votes” occurring in connection with any of the proposals at the special meeting. A
broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker or
other nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of
the shares on a particular proposal but has discretionary voting power on other proposals at such meeting.

Revocation of Proxies

Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time before it is voted. If
you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by:

• submitting a new proxy card with a later date, which is received by Vascular Solutions prior to the final vote at the special
meeting;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• using the telephone or internet proxy submission procedures described above, or by completing, signing, dating and
returning a new proxy card by mail to Vascular Solutions;

• attending the special meeting, delivering a written notice of revocation and voting in person; or

• delivering a written notice of revocation by mail to Vascular Solutions in care of the Secretary at 6464 Sycamore Court
North, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55369, Attn: Secretary, which is received by Vascular Solutions prior to the final vote at
the special meeting.

Please note that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions
described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. If you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to Vascular
Solutions or by sending a written notice of revocation to Vascular Solutions, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card
or written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by Vascular Solutions before the special meeting.

Please note that if you hold your shares in “street name” and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your
shares, you should instead follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your prior voting
instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting in person at the special meeting
if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the
special meeting.

Abstentions

An abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either in person or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting.
Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of our common stock present or represented at the special
meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.

Abstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the
merger agreement. The requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of shares voted
“FOR” such proposal compared to the number of shares voted “AGAINST” such proposal. If you abstain from voting with respect
to such proposals or do not vote on such proposals, such failure to vote will not have the effect of either a vote “FOR” or a vote
“AGAINST” the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of Vascular Solutions in connection with the merger or the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting.

Board of Directors’ Recommendation

Our board, after considering various factors described in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Reasons for our
Board’s Recommendation in Favor of the Merger,” unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Vascular Solutions
and our shareholders, and approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
merger.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) ”FOR” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger
agreement, (2) ”FOR” the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to
the named executive officers of Vascular Solutions in connection with the merger, and (3) ”FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special
meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum.

Solicitation of Proxies

Our board is soliciting your proxy, and we will bear the cost of this solicitation of proxies. This includes the charges and
expenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of our outstanding common stock.
We have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc., referred to as “D.F. King,” a proxy solicitation firm, to assist our board in the solicitation of
proxies for the special meeting, and we expect to pay D.F. King $25,000, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies
may be solicited by mail, personal interview, email, telephone or via the internet by D.F. King or, without additional compensation,
by certain of our directors, officers and employees.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER (PROPOSAL 1)

The description of the merger in this section and elsewhere in this document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this document.
This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger that is important to you.
You are encouraged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Certain Effects of the Merger

If the merger agreement is adopted by our shareholders and the other conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied
or waived, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Vascular Solutions, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will
cease. Vascular Solutions will be the surviving company in the merger and will continue its corporate existence as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Teleflex.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, referred to as the
“effective time,” each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time (other than shares of
our common stock owned directly by Teleflex or Merger Sub or by any wholly owned subsidiary of Teleflex or of Vascular
Solutions as of immediately prior to the effective time, referred to as the “cancelled shares,” and any shares of our common stock
held of record or beneficially by a person who has not voted in favor of approval of the merger and adoption of the merger
agreement and who is entitled to properly demand dissenter’s rights with respect to such shares, referred to as the “dissenting
shares”) will be converted into the right to receive $56.00 in cash, without interest, less any required withholding taxes. At the
effective time of the merger, our current shareholders will cease to have ownership interests in the surviving company or rights as its
shareholders. Therefore, our current shareholders will not participate in any of our future earnings or growth and will not benefit
from any appreciation in our value.

Our common stock is currently registered under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, referred to as the “Exchange
Act,” and is quoted on Nasdaq under the symbol “VASC.” As a result of the merger, Vascular Solutions will cease to be a publicly
traded company and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Teleflex. Following the consummation of the merger, our common stock
will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and Vascular Solutions will no longer be required to file
periodic reports with the SEC with respect to our common stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law, rules and
regulations.

Effects on Vascular Solutions if the Merger is Not Completed

If the merger agreement is not approved by our shareholders or if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, our
shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, we will remain a public company, the common
stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic
reports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, we expect that management will operate the business in a manner
similar to that in which it is being operated today and that our shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and
opportunities as they currently are, including, among other things, general industry, economic and market conditions. Additionally,
if the merger is not completed, our shareholders may be subject to the risks associated with a transition in leadership, as our current
chief executive officer, Howard Root, has indicated to our board that he is unwilling to continue to serve in that role long-term.
Accordingly, if the merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the
future value of your shares of our common stock. From time to time, our board will evaluate and review our business operations,
properties, dividend policy and capitalization, among other things, make such changes as are deemed appropriate and continue to
seek to identify strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. If the merger agreement is not approved by our shareholders or
if the merger is not consummated for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to us will be
offered or that our business, prospects or results of operations will not be adversely impacted.

If the merger agreement is terminated, under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay Teleflex a termination fee as
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Background of the Merger

The following chronology summarizes certain key events and contacts that led to the signing of the merger agreement. It does
not purport to catalogue every conversation among our board, members of our management, or our representatives and other parties.

In November 2014, Vascular Solutions and our chief executive officer, Howard Root, were indicted on felony criminal charges
in the Western District of Texas over allegations that Vascular Solutions’ sales representatives promoted “off-label” the Vari-Lase
Short Kit referred to as the “Short Kit litigation.” At regular meetings held during 2015, our board discussed contingency plans for
the Company in the event the Company or Mr. Root were convicted at trial, including the potential retention of Guggenheim
Securities, LLC, referred to as “Guggenheim Securities,” to advise the board with an exploration of strategic alternatives. In
connection with this contingency planning, our board directed our management to begin to negotiate the terms of an engagement
letter with Guggenheim Securities so that Guggenheim Securities could be engaged quickly in case an adverse result in the Short Kit
litigation necessitated an expedited sale process. In February 2016, upon completion of the criminal trial in San Antonio, a
unanimous not guilty verdict was returned by the jury on all charges, a decision which was final and not subject to appeal. The
closing price of our common stock on February 25, 2016, the day prior to our announcement of the jury verdict, was $26.25 per
share.

On April 25, 2016, after the close of trading on the Nasdaq, we issued a press release reporting the Company’s results of
operations and financial condition for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016. The closing price of our common stock on April 25,
2016 was $37.09. On April 26, 2016, the first trading day after our earnings announcement, the closing price of our common stock
was $37.06 per share.

On June 10, 2016, Mr. Root met with the Vice President of Global Corporate Development & Strategy and the President &
General Manager of Teleflex’s vascular division at the offices of Guggenheim Securities. The Vice President of Global Corporate
Development & Strategy had requested that Guggenheim Securities arrange a meeting with Mr. Root in order to convey Teleflex’s
general interest in Vascular Solutions and its products and indicated to Guggenheim Securities that Teleflex had been monitoring
Vascular Solutions as a potential candidate for collaboration or acquisition. During this meeting, Mr. Root presented information
based on the Company’s standard investor presentation to the representatives of Teleflex. No confidential information was disclosed
by Mr. Root during this meeting, and no discussion of an acquisition or other corporate transaction occurred during this meeting.

During July 2016, Mr. Root discussed individually with each of our board members his long-terms plans and his commitment
to serving as the Company’s chief executive officer. In these discussions, Mr. Root indicated that, while he did not have any
immediate or definitive plans to resign as the Company’s chief executive officer, Mr. Root had reflected upon his experience in the
Short Kit litigation and concluded that he was not prepared to continue to assume, as a long-term matter, the personal liability risks
associated with serving as the chief executive officer of a medical device company.

At a board dinner held in the evening of July 21, 2016 and a board meeting held on July 22, 2016, our board discussed Mr.
Root’s unwillingness to continue to serve long-term as the Company’s chief executive officer, the consequences of this development
on the future of the Company and the full range of alternatives available to our board in responding to this development. In
particular, among other matters, our board discussed the risks to the future performance of the Company without Mr. Root’s
leadership of the Company and his direction on product development, the risks associated with a CEO succession, including the risk
that a new CEO would be unsuccessful in implementing the Company's strategic plan and the previous efforts undertaken by Mr.
Root to identify and develop a qualified successor. Our board also discussed the attractiveness of the current market valuation of the
Company and the state of the mergers and acquisitions market, and discussed with our legal counsel, Dorsey & Whitney LLP,
referred to as “Dorsey,” the directors’ fiduciary duties in connection with evaluating a potential sale transaction. Following the
discussion of the range of alternatives, which discussion was conducted both among the full board and in an executive session of
independent directors, and after balancing the benefits and risks associated with each of the potential alternatives, including the risks
faced by smaller medical device companies in successfully scaling their businesses, our board directed our management to enter into
an engagement letter with Guggenheim Securities to assist the board with its exploration of strategic alternatives. Our board selected
Guggenheim Securities, based on, among other things, the firm’s extensive expertise and experience in our industry and its
understanding of macro issues affecting our industry, Guggenheim Securities’ status as an internationally recognized investment
banking, financial advisory and

securities firm whose senior professionals have substantial experience advising companies in, among other industries, the medical
device industry, its long-term knowledge of the Company’s business and its prior work in evaluating the Company’s strategic
alternatives. Starting from the form of engagement letter that had been commenced in early 2016, our management and Guggenheim
Securities negotiated the engagement letter’s terms and, on July 28, 2016, the Company executed an engagement letter with
Guggenheim Securities.

On July 25, 2016, after the close of trading on the Nasdaq, we issued a press release reporting the Company’s results of
operations and financial condition for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016. The closing price of our common stock on July 25,
2016 was $42.32. On July 26, 2016, the first trading day after our earnings announcement, the closing price of our common stock
was $46.36 per share.

In late July 2016, at the direction of our board and management, Guggenheim Securities commenced contacting potential
strategic acquirers on a confidential basis to determine such acquirers’ interest in receiving an update regarding the Company’s
business, operations and recent performance. These initial contacts, which Guggenheim Securities and our management used to
gauge interest in a potential transaction involving the Company, were made with a total of 13 parties, including Teleflex, in late-July
and early-August 2016. The 13 parties contacted by Guggenheim Securities were identified by our management with the assistance
of Guggenheim Securities as including the parties with the highest anticipated level of interest in a strategic transaction with the
Company based on prior expressions of interest in the Company’s business or based on the perceived strategic fit of the Company’s
business with that of the proposed party and the market valuation of the potential strategic acquirers relative to the Company. Based
on an analysis of the Company’s current valuation and guidance from Guggenheim Securities as to the internal rate of return hurdles
typically sought by a private equity sponsor in connection with an investment, our management concluded that it was unlikely that a
financial sponsor would be able to make an offer for the Company at a competitive valuation.

In August 2016, seven of the 13 parties initially contacted by Guggenheim Securities, including Teleflex, expressed interest in
receiving a confidential update regarding the Company’s business, operations and recent performance. Those seven parties were
supplied with a customary non-disclosure agreement to govern the exchange of confidential information regarding the Company.
Five potential acquirers, including Teleflex, executed a non-disclosure agreement with the Company. The non-disclosure agreements
executed with three of the five potential acquirers, including Teleflex, contained a standstill clause; in each case, the standstill clause
terminated upon public announcement of certain transactions, including the merger. The other two parties which had initially
expressed interest in receiving a confidential update dropped out ahead of executing a non-disclosure agreement and receiving an
update from the Company.

On August 24, 2016, members of Teleflex management met with members of our senior management team, at our headquarters
in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Our management presented Teleflex management with an overview of our business and operations,
including a tour of the facilities.

On September 8, 2016, at the direction of our board, Guggenheim Securities communicated to each of the five potential
acquirers, including Teleflex, that our board had authorized a process to solicit non-binding indications of interest for an acquisition
of Vascular Solutions.

On September 13, 2016, at the direction of our board, Guggenheim Securities supplied each of the five potential acquirers,
including Teleflex, with a confidential information packet prepared by our management, including a company overview and the
non-public unaudited prospective financial information described under the heading “—Certain Vascular Solutions Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information.”

Between September 13 and October 17, 2016, at the direction of our management, Guggenheim Securities sent certain
additional due diligence information to each of the five potential acquirers, including Teleflex, and the Company responded to
additional requests for information made by the potential acquirers, including Teleflex.

Between September 16 and October 6, 2016, representatives of Guggenheim Securities, Mr. Root and, in some cases, other
members of our management team participated in executive presentations with representatives of each of the five potential
acquirers, including Teleflex. The presentation with Teleflex was conducted on September 16, 2016 at Guggenheim Securities’
offices in New York City with Mr. Root.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On September 16, 2016, at the direction of our board, Guggenheim Securities sent initial bid instruction letters to
representatives of the five potential acquirers, including Teleflex. The bid instruction letters established October 17, 2016 as the
deadline for non-binding indications of interest.

Between September 29 and October 17, 2016, each of the four potential acquirers, other than Teleflex, communicated to
representatives of Guggenheim Securities that it would decline to submit a non-binding indication of interest for an acquisition of
Vascular Solutions, with the last remaining potential acquirer, other than Teleflex, notifying Guggenheim Securities on October 17
that it would decline to submit a non-binding indication of interest. Among the reasons cited by certain of the parties was that the
market valuation of the Company, based on recent trading prices of the Company’s common stock, would not permit them to make
an offer for the Company at a competitive valuation.

On October 17, 2016, Teleflex submitted a non-binding indication of interest for the acquisition of Vascular Solutions at a price
of $55.25, in cash. The closing price of our common stock on October 17, 2016 was $45.89 per share.

At a board dinner held in the evening of October 20, 2016, Guggenheim Securities reviewed with our board certain work
performed by Guggenheim Securities on behalf of Teleflex during the past two years, none of which resulted in the receipt by
Guggenheim Securities of any investment banking or financial advisory fees. This work included a preliminary analysis of the
Company’s weighted average cost of capital prepared by Guggenheim Securities in July 2016. See the section entitled “Opinion of
Vascular Solutions’ Financial Advisor—Other Considerations.” Our board discussed the past work performed by Guggenheim
Securities and the potential conflicts of interest created by such work and concluded that the matters disclosed by Guggenheim
Securities to the board did not create a conflict of interest that would disqualify Guggenheim Securities from serving as the
Company’s financial advisor in a transaction with Teleflex. Guggenheim Securities then described the process undertaken to date to
solicit non-binding indications of interest and presented the non-binding indication of interest submitted by Teleflex to our board.
Guggenheim Securities also reviewed the proposed sources of financing, due diligence requirements and necessary approvals
associated with the Teleflex proposal, noting, among other things, that the Teleflex proposal specifically highlighted the fact that any
definitive agreement eventually reached by the parties would not condition Teleflex’s obligation to close the transaction on the
receipt of financing. Guggenheim Securities also reviewed with the board in detail its financial analysis of the proposed merger
consideration of $55.25, in cash, represented by the Teleflex proposal. Dorsey again reviewed with our board the directors’ fiduciary
duties in connection with evaluating a potential sale transaction. At our board meeting held on October 21, 2016, among other
matters, our board further discussed the non-binding indication of interest, as well as strategic alternatives to the sale process.
Following the discussion among our board and its advisors, our board determined to continue the process for exploring a sale of
Vascular Solutions based on, among other matters, the value represented by the cash consideration to be paid to our shareholders
under the Teleflex proposal and authorized and instructed Guggenheim Securities to communicate to Teleflex that, based on its non-
binding proposal, the Company would continue to engage in discussions with Teleflex in an effort to arrive at an acceptable
transaction.

On October 24, 2016, Vascular Solutions granted Teleflex and its representatives access to a virtual dataroom established for
the provision of due diligence information to Teleflex and its representatives.

Also on October 24, 2016, after the close of trading on the Nasdaq, we issued a press release reporting the Company’s results
of operations and financial condition for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016. The closing price of our common stock on
October 24, 2016 was $48.63. On October 25, 2016, the first trading day after our earnings announcement, the closing price of our
common stock was $48.17 per share.

Between the time it first granted access to the virtual dataroom to Teleflex and the execution of the merger agreement on
December 1, 2016, Vascular Solutions responded to numerous requests from Teleflex and its representatives in connection with the
business, legal, accounting and financial due diligence investigation of Vascular Solutions undertaken by such parties.

On October 25, 2016, a representative of Teleflex’s financial advisor, J.P. Morgan, contacted Guggenheim Securities to discuss
the possibility of accelerating the process to acquire Vascular Solutions in order to accommodate structuring and financing options
then under consideration by Teleflex. At management’s direction, Guggenheim Securities responded that if Teleflex were to submit
a definitive proposal with updated views as to valuation and the timing of a potential transaction in advance of the deadline set for
submission of definitive

TABLE OF CONTENTS

proposals for the acquisition of Vascular Solutions, our board was prepared to consider such proposal. Guggenheim Securities
further informed Teleflex that, absent the submission of a proposal on an accelerated basis, our board would consider definitive
proposals on a timeline to be described in a bid process letter to be supplied to Teleflex.

Also on October 25, 2016, members of Teleflex’s management team attended a site visit of our facilities in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, conducted by our executive management team. Additional site visits to our Minneapolis, Minnesota facilities, each
focusing on different areas of operational or regulatory diligence, were attended by Teleflex personnel on November 2, November 4,
November 8 and November 17, and on November 11, members of Teleflex’s management team attended a site visit of our facilities
in Galway, Ireland.

On November, 1, 2016, at the direction of our management, Guggenheim Securities provided a bid instruction letter and a draft
of the merger agreement to J.P. Morgan. The bid instruction letter established December 7, 2016 as the deadline for submitting a
definitive proposal to acquire Vascular Solutions.

On November 7, 2016, members of Teleflex management and representatives of J.P. Morgan attended a management
presentation held at the Company’s headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, conducted by the Company’s executive management
team. The closing price of our common stock on November 7, 2016 was $45.95 per share.

On November 8, 2016, representatives of Dorsey had a telephone conference with representatives of Teleflex’s legal counsel,
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, referred to as “Simpson,” to discuss the transaction structure and certain elements of Minnesota
law. Members of Vascular Solutions management and Teleflex management, as well as representatives of Guggenheim Securities
and J.P. Morgan, also participated in the discussion.

On November 15, 2016, a representative of J.P. Morgan contacted Guggenheim Securities to inform Guggenheim Securities
that Teleflex had determined that the potential structuring and financing options that would have necessitated Teleflex’s early
submission of a definitive proposal were not viable and that Teleflex anticipated submitting its definitive proposal in the timeline
outlined in the bid process letter.

On November 16, 2016, at an industry conference, in a conversation with Mr. Root, a sell-side analyst not affiliated with a firm
that, to our knowledge, had been engaged by the Company, Teleflex or any of the other parties which had executed non-disclosure
agreements with the Company in connection with the sale process, indicated an awareness of the confidential process being
undertaken by Vascular Solutions to evaluate strategic opportunities and of the representatives Vascular Solutions had engaged as
part of that process but did not mention any potential acquirers involved in such process. The closing price of our common stock on
November 15, 2016, the day prior to the day of the conversation between Mr. Root and the analyst, was $49.90 per share.

On November 17, 2016, at the direction of our management, representatives of Guggenheim Securities and J.P. Morgan
discussed, and a representative of Guggenheim Securities discussed with Teleflex’s chief executive officer and other members of
Teleflex’s senior management team, the comments made to Mr. Root by the analyst the prior day, recent activity in the trading of
Vascular Solutions’ stock, recent appreciation in the price of Vascular Solutions stock and the implications of this activity on our
board’s evaluation of strategic alternatives. At management’s instruction, the Guggenheim Securities representative requested that
Teleflex consider accelerating its evaluation of the Company in order to be in a position to submit a definitive proposal to acquire
Vascular Solutions in advance of the December 7 deadline that had been set in the bid instructions.

On November 18, 2016, Teleflex’s chief executive officer provided an update to a representative of Guggenheim Securities
regarding the status of its due diligence and financing related activities, stating that Teleflex would be in a position to sign a
definitive agreement to acquire Vascular Solutions by late November or early December.

On November 20, 2016, at the direction of our management, Guggenheim Securities sent J.P. Morgan a draft of the confidential
disclosure schedules to the merger agreement.

On November 21, 2016, J.P. Morgan called Guggenheim Securities to provide an update on a meeting that Teleflex’s board of
directors held earlier that day. J.P. Morgan confirmed that, in the board meeting, the Teleflex

board had confirmed the valuation of Teleflex’s proposal to acquire the Company at a price of $55.25 per share and its ability to
execute a definitive agreement to acquire Vascular Solutions by December 5, 2016. The closing price of our common stock on
November 21, 2016 was $53.85 per share.

In the evening of November 21, 2016, our board met to discuss the status of negotiations with Teleflex. Dorsey again reviewed
with our board the directors’ fiduciary duties in connection with evaluating a potential sale transaction. Guggenheim Securities
provided a process overview, with a focus on developments since the last board meeting, reported on the status of various Teleflex
workstreams related to the transaction and informing the definitive proposal to be delivered by Teleflex and the most recent
guidance provided by Teleflex regarding the valuation of its proposal. Guggenheim Securities also reported on recent activity in the
trading of Vascular Solutions’ stock and the recent appreciation in the price of Vascular Solutions’ stock. Guggenheim Securities
reviewed with our board in detail its financial analysis of the proposed merger consideration of $55.25, in cash, represented by the
Teleflex proposal. After a discussion of alternative responses to Teleflex, our board instructed Guggenheim Securities to convey to
Teleflex and its representatives our board’s willingness to continue to work toward a transaction with Teleflex but to communicate
that additional consideration above the current valuation of $55.25 per share was necessary for Vascular Solutions to enter into a
definitive merger agreement with Teleflex.

On November 22, 2016, Guggenheim Securities contacted J.P. Morgan to update J.P. Morgan on the previous night’s meeting
of our board and to communicate our board’s views regarding the valuation component of the Teleflex proposal to acquire Vascular
Solutions.

On November 25, 2016, members of our executive management team provided members of Teleflex management with an
update on the Company’s operational and financial performance during the fourth quarter to date.

On November 28, 2016, J.P. Morgan provided Teleflex’s mark-up of the draft merger agreement and a draft debt financing
commitment letter to Guggenheim Securities. Teleflex’s mark-up of the merger agreement, among other things, reflected the debt
commitment letters to be entered into with J.P. Morgan in order to finance the transaction, increased the matching period before
which our board could make a change in its recommendation to our shareholders from two business days to five business days,
increased the fiduciary termination fee from 2.5% of equity value to 3.5% of equity value and provided for an obligation for
Vascular Solutions to reimburse Teleflex for transaction expenses up to $7 million in the event that the merger was not approved by
our shareholders.

On November 29, 2016, Teleflex submitted a definitive proposal for the acquisition of Vascular Solutions at a price of $55.75,
in cash. The Teleflex proposal highlighted the fact that the closing of a transaction to acquire Vascular Solutions would not be
subject to any financing contingency and indicated that Teleflex had completed its due diligence investigation of Vascular Solutions
and expected to be able to finalize the merger agreement and execute a definitive merger agreement by December 1, 2016. The
closing price of our common stock on November 29, 2016 was $53.75 per share.

Also on November 29, 2016, a representative of Guggenheim Securities attended a meeting with members of the Teleflex
senior management team, including Teleflex’s chief executive officer, who were in New York City for an industry conference.
During the meeting, at the direction of our management and based on discussions with our board, the representative of Guggenheim
Securities communicated that Teleflex would likely have to increase its proposed price of $55.75 in order for our board to authorize
entry into a definitive agreement with Teleflex.

In the evening of November 29, 2016, our board met via telephone conference to discuss the definitive proposal received from
Teleflex. Guggenheim Securities updated our board on developments since the last board meeting and described the definitive
proposal submitted by Teleflex. Dorsey reviewed with our board the material issues raised by Teleflex’s mark-up of the merger
agreement, including Teleflex’s proposed changes to the matching period and fiduciary termination fee and the Teleflex expense
reimbursement proposal. Dorsey and management reviewed proposed responses to Teleflex on these points with our board. After a
discussion of alternative responses to Teleflex, our board instructed Dorsey to continue to advance the transaction documentation in
order to facilitate the execution of a definitive agreement on December 1 and instructed

Guggenheim Securities to request that Teleflex submit a best and final price for the acquisition of Vascular Solutions for our board’s
consideration. Our board instructed Guggenheim Securities to communicate that additional consideration above the current
valuation of $55.75 per share was necessary for Vascular Solutions to enter into a definitive merger agreement with Teleflex.

Also, in the evening of November 29, 2016, Dorsey provided a revised draft of the merger agreement to Simpson reflecting the
instructions received from our board at the board meeting held earlier that evening. The Dorsey draft, among other things, proposed
a four-business day initial matching period, followed by subsequent matching periods of two business days in the event of material
changes to any such competing proposal, proposed a fiduciary termination fee of 3.0% of equity value and eliminated the obligation
for Vascular Solutions to reimburse Teleflex for transaction expenses up to $7 million in the event that the merger was not approved
by our shareholders.

On November 30, 2016, as instructed by the board, representatives of Guggenheim Securities contacted representative of J.P.
Morgan to request that Teleflex submit a best and final price for the acquisition of Vascular Solutions and communicated our board’s
guidance regarding valuation.

On November 30, 2016, Simpson provided a revised draft of the merger agreement to Dorsey. The Simpson draft, among other
things, increased the fiduciary termination fee to 3.25% of equity value and reinstated the obligation for Vascular Solutions to
reimburse Teleflex for transaction expenses up to $7 million in the event that the merger was not approved by our shareholders.
Following Dorsey’s receipt of the Simpson mark-up, representatives of Dorsey and Simpson held a call to negotiate, but did not
resolve, the remaining open points in the merger agreement. Also on November 30, Dorsey sent a revised draft of the confidential
disclosure schedules to the merger agreement to Simpson.

On December 1, 2016, representatives of Dorsey, acting on instructions provided by our management, and Simpson negotiated
the remaining open points in the merger agreement. The negotiations resulted in, among other things, Teleflex dropping its request
to be reimbursed for transaction expenses up to $7 million in the event that the merger was not approved by our shareholders in
exchange for a fiduciary termination fee of 3.5% of equity value as proposed in Teleflex’s initial mark-up.

After the close of Nasdaq trading on December 1, 2016, Teleflex submitted a proposal characterized as best and final for the
acquisition of Vascular Solutions at a price of $56.00, in cash. The closing price of our common stock on December 1, 2016 was
$55.10 per share.

In the afternoon of December 1, 2016, our board met by telephone conference to consider approval of the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby. Prior to the meeting, the members of our board were provided with materials relating to
the proposed acquisition, including, among other things, the current draft of the merger agreement, a summary of the material terms
of the merger agreement prepared by Dorsey and a financial analysis prepared by Guggenheim Securities. At the meeting,
representatives of Dorsey presented a summary of the material terms of the proposed merger agreement and described the resolution
of the material open points in the merger agreement that had been negotiated since the previous board meeting. Guggenheim
Securities reviewed with our board its financial analysis of the consideration to be received in connection with the merger and
rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 1, 2016, to our board to the effect that, as of
that date and based on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations
of and qualifications to the review undertaken, the consideration to be received in connection with the merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of our common stock (excluding (i) any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or (ii)
Teleflex, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates). Following consideration and discussion of the terms of the proposed merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, our board formed a special committee composed solely of disinterested
directors who were not, and who had not been, our officers or employees of the Company during the prior five years, in order for the
committee to consider the merger agreement, and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, solely for purposes of
certain Minnesota anti-takeover statutes. The special committee then approved the merger agreement, and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, for purposes of certain Minnesota anti-takeover statutes and recommended that our full
board approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Our board then unanimously (i) declared and
determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to and
in the best interests of Vascular Solutions and its shareholders; (ii) approved and

declared advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; (iii)
recommended to our shareholders that they approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement; and (iv) directed that the approval
of merger and adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of our shareholders.

The parties executed the merger agreement during the evening of December 1, 2016, and each of Teleflex and the Company
issued a press release prior to the opening of Nasdaq trading on December 2, 2016, announcing the parties’ entry into the merger
agreement.

Reasons for our Board’s Recommendation in Favor of the Merger

On December 1, 2016, our board unanimously (i) declared and determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Vascular Solutions and its shareholders;
(ii) approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement; (iii) recommended to our shareholders that they approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement; and (iv) directed
that the approval of merger and adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of our shareholders.

In evaluating the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, our board
consulted with our executive management, outside legal counsel and an outside financial advisor. In recommending that our
shareholders vote their shares of common stock in favor of the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement, our
board also considered a number of factors potentially weighing in favor of the merger, including the following factors (which are
not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

• The Prospects of the Company; Risks Relating to Remaining a Stand-Alone Company. Our board reviewed our current and
historical financial condition, results of operations, prospects, business strategy, competitive position and industry,
including the potential impact (which cannot be quantified numerically) of those factors on the trading price of our
common stock, to assess the prospects and risks associated with remaining an independent public company, including:

° the unwillingness of our current chief executive officer, Howard Root, to continue to serve in that role on a long-term
basis;

° the board’s evaluation of the risks associated with a CEO succession, including the risk that a new CEO would be
unsuccessful in implementing the Company’s strategic plan;

° the uncertainties associated with achieving and executing upon the Company’s business and financial plans in the
short- and long-term, including the risks associated with commercializing or successfully completing clinical trials
for new products, including our RePlas freeze dried plasma product and our large bore closure product, and the
potential for significant delays in the successful commencement or completion of our clinical trials, the risks
associated with plans to increase international growth and the other risks and uncertainties described in the section
entitled “Risk Factors” set forth in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015;

° increasing regulatory and compliance requirements for operating as a medical device company in the U.S. and
international markets, and the increasing challenges faced by small medical device companies in managing those
requirements;

° competition for the products that we manufacture and sell and the ability to compete successfully in light of the
nature of the medical device industry and the presence of many larger, well-financed competitors;

° the uncertain nature of U.S. and global equity, debt and currency markets and economic conditions; and

° the volatility in our financial performance resulting from various factors, including the factors described above.

• The Merger Consideration. Our board believes that the merger consideration of $56.00 per share, taking into account our
board’s evaluation of the prospects and risks associated with remaining an independent public company as described
above, represents full and fair value for our shares and is

29



8/31/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1030206/000156761917000061/s001489x2_defm14a.htm

TABLE OF CONTENTS

more favorable to our shareholders than the potential value of remaining an independent public company. In addition, our
board considered the historic volatility in the trading price of our shares as demonstrated by the broad range of 52-week
high and low trading prices of our shares. Specifically, our board considered:

° that the merger consideration of $56.00 per share represented a premium of 16% over the average closing price of our
shares for the 90 trading days ended December 1, 2016, the last trading day prior to our announcement of the entry in
the merger agreement;

° that the merger consideration of $56.00 per share represented 38.4x the midpoint of the Company’s preliminary 2017
earnings-per-share guidance of $1.44 to $1.48; and

° that the enterprise value of the transaction, based upon the merger consideration of $56.00 per share, represented 5.2x
the midpoint of the Company’s preliminary 2017 revenue guidance of $183 million to $187 million.

• Certainty of Value. Our board considered that the consideration to be received by our shareholders in the merger will
consist entirely of cash, which provides liquidity and certainty of value to shareholders. Our board believes this certainty
of value is compelling compared to its potential long-term value, taking into account the Company’s future prospects and
the anticipated timing and execution risks of implementing the Company’s business plan. Our board considered its
knowledge of Teleflex, its financial condition and the representations and covenants of Teleflex in the merger agreement
regarding its obligations to obtain financing sufficient to pay the merger consideration and the fact that Teleflex’s
obligation to close the merger is not subject to any financing contingency. Our board believes, after consultation with
senior management and its legal advisors, that there are unlikely to be any significant delays or obstacles to Teleflex
obtaining the necessary regulatory clearances and approvals to complete the merger.

• Competitive Auction Process. Our board considered the fact that our board and senior management, in coordination with
our independent legal and financial advisors, implemented a robust sale process involving a broad group of 13 potential
acquirers determined by our management to be the most likely to have interest in an acquisition and the fact that five
potential acquirers entered into non-disclosure agreements with us and received information related to us. Our board
believes that the per-share merger consideration to be paid by Teleflex in the merger was the best price reasonably
attainable for our shareholders.

• Fairness Opinion. Our board considered the opinion, dated December 1, 2016, of Guggenheim Securities to our board as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the $56.00 per share in cash to be
received in connection with the merger by holders of our common stock (excluding (i) any wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company or (ii) Teleflex, Merger Sub or their respective affiliates), which opinion was based on and subject to the matters
considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations and qualifications to the review
undertaken as more fully described under the section entitled “Opinion of Vascular Solutions’ Financial Advisor.” The full
text of the written opinion of Guggenheim Securities is attached hereto as Annex B.

• The Terms of the Merger Agreement. Our board considered all of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement,
including the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties, the conditions to closing, the form of
the merger consideration and the structure of the termination rights, including:

° that the terms of the merger agreement were the product of arms-length negotiations between two sophisticated
parties and their respective financial and legal advisors;

° that the “fiduciary out” provisions of the merger agreement, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, permit the
Company to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with third parties that make unsolicited acquisition
proposals and, upon payment of a $35 million termination fee (approximately 3.5% of the transaction value),
terminate the merger agreement in order to approve a superior proposal;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

° the board’s belief that the $35 million termination fee payable by the Company upon its termination of the merger
agreement to accept a superior proposal (i) is reasonable in light of the overall terms of the merger agreement and the
benefits of the merger, (ii) reflects the competitive auction conducted by the board, our management and financial
and legal advisors to solicit proposal for the acquisition of Vascular Solutions and (iii) would not preclude another
party from making a competing proposal;

° Teleflex’s obligations to close the merger are subject to a limited number of conditions and are not subject to a
financing condition, and the board’s belief, in consultation with senior management and legal advisors, that the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are reasonably likely to be consummated; and

° the Company’s ability to enforce any provision of the merger agreement by a decree of specific performance if
Teleflex fails, or threatens to fail, to satisfy their obligations under the merger agreement.

• Dissenters’ Rights. Our board considered the availability of dissenters’ rights to our shareholders who comply with
specified procedures under Minnesota law.

In its deliberations concerning the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, our board also
considered and balanced against the factors potentially weighing in favor of the merger a number of uncertainties, risks, restrictions
and other factors potentially weighing against the merger, including the following (which are not necessarily presented in order of
relative importance):

• No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. Our board considered the fact that our shareholders would
forgo the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the successful execution of our current strategy as an
independent public company by participating in any future earnings or growth or in any future appreciation in value of
shares of our common stock.

• Taxable Consideration. Our board considered the fact that receipt of the all-cash merger consideration would be taxable to
those of our shareholders that are treated as U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

• Termination Fee. Our board considered the fact that, under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay fees and
expenses in the event the merger agreement is terminated and the effect this could have on Vascular Solutions, including:

° the possibility that the $35 million termination fee payable by us to Teleflex upon the termination of the merger
agreement under certain circumstances could discourage other potential acquirers from making a competing proposal,
although our board believed that the termination fee was reasonable in amount and would not unduly deter any other
party that might be interested in acquiring us; and

° if the merger is not consummated, we will generally be required to pay our own expenses associated with the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

• Monetary and Opportunity Costs / Interim Restrictions. Our board considered the significant costs involved in connection
with entering into and completing the merger and the substantial time and effort of management required to consummate
the merger, which could disrupt our business operations. Our board also considered the restrictions on our conduct of
business prior to completion of the merger, which could delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that
may arise or taking other actions with respect to our operations during the pendency of the merger, whether or not the
merger is completed.

• Effects of Transaction Announcement. Our board considered the fact that the announcement and pendency of the merger,
or the failure to complete the merger, may cause substantial harm to our relationships with its employees (including
making it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel and the possible loss of key management and other personnel),
vendors and customers.

• Effect on Market Price. Our board considered the fact that the market price of our common stock could be affected by
many factors, including: (i) if the merger agreement is terminated, the reason or reasons

31



8/31/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1030206/000156761917000061/s001489x2_defm14a.htm

TABLE OF CONTENTS

for such termination and whether such termination resulted from factors adversely affecting us; (ii) the possibility that, as
a result of the termination of the merger agreement, possible acquirers may consider us to be an unattractive acquisition
candidate; and (iii) the possible sale of our common stock by short-term investors following an announcement that the
merger agreement was terminated.

• Closing Conditions. Our board considered the fact that completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction of certain
closing conditions that are not within the Company’s control, including receipt of the necessary regulatory clearances and
approvals and that no material adverse effect on the Company has occurred.

• Potential Conflicts of Interest. Our board considered the fact that certain of our directors and executive officers may have
interests in the merger that may be deemed to be different from, or in addition to, those of our shareholders. Our board was
made aware of and considered these interests; for more information about such interests, see below under the heading “—
Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, our board concluded that the risks, uncertainties,
restrictions and potentially negative factors associated with the merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the merger to
our shareholders.

The foregoing discussion of factors considered by our board is not intended to be exhaustive, but summarizes the material
factors considered by our board. In light of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger, our
board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in
reaching its determination and recommendation. Moreover, each member of our board applied his or her own personal business
judgment to the process and may have given different weight to different factors. Our board did not undertake to make any specific
determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not support its ultimate
determination. Our board based its recommendation on the totality of the information presented, including thorough discussions
with, and questioning of, our executive management, financial advisor and legal counsel. It should be noted that this explanation of
the reasoning of our board and certain information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and should be read in light
of the factors set forth in “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”

Certain Vascular Solutions Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

Vascular Solutions does not, as a matter of course, develop or publicly disclose long-term projections or internal projections of
its future financial performance revenues, earnings, financial condition or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty
of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the solicitation of non-binding indications of interest for
the acquisition of Vascular Solutions, our management prepared certain non-public unaudited prospective financial information,
referred to as the “September projections,” and provided the September projections to five potential acquirers, including Teleflex,
who had executed non-disclosure agreement with the Company in connection with their due diligence reviews of a possible
transaction. See “—Background of the Merger.” In October 2016, our management prepared certain updated non-public unaudited
prospective financial information, which made certain corrections and adjustments to the September projections, and provided this
prospective financial information to Guggenheim Securities for use in performing its financial analyses summarized below and
presented by Guggenheim Securities to our board. See “—Opinion of Vascular Solutions’ Financial Advisor.” We refer to the
updated non-public unaudited prospective financial information provided to Guggenheim Securities as the “updated projections”
and refer to the September projections and the updated projections, collectively, as the “projections.” The projections were provided
to our board and certain other advisors in connection with our evaluation of a possible transaction.

The projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and the September projections are included in this proxy
statement because the September projections were supplied to Teleflex and the updated projections are included in this proxy
statement because such information was part of the basis for the opinion of Guggenheim Securities. The projections were not
prepared with a view to compliance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States, which we refer to
as “GAAP,” the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements or the guidelines established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information.
Furthermore, neither Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, our independent auditor, nor any other independent

From the updated projections, Guggenheim Securities created a probability-adjusted case for use in the discounted cash flow
analysis used by Guggenheim Securities in the preparation of its opinion. See “—Opinion of Vascular Solutions’ Financial
Advisor.” The probability-adjusted case assumed a 75% probability of success, per direction provided by Vascular Solutions
management, applied to our RePlas freeze dried plasma product and

(3) Unlevered cash flows were not included in the updated projections. Guggenheim Securities calculated unlevered free cash flows for the years 2017-2021 based
on the updated projections for use in the discounted cash flow analysis used by Guggenheim Securities in the preparation of its opinion.

Although a summary of the projections is presented with numerical specificity, the projections reflect numerous assumptions
and estimates as to future events made by our management that our management believed were reasonable at the time the
projections were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available to management at the time. However, this
information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that
may affect actual results and cause the projections not to be achieved include general economic conditions, accuracy of certain
accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, the timing of new product launches, competitive pressures and
changes in tax laws. In addition, the projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that
they were prepared and do not give effect to the merger. Further, the projections do not take into account the potential consequences
should the merger fail to be consummated, and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. As a result, there can
be no assurance that the projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the
projections. The inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that the our board, our management, our
financial advisor or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, the projections to be material information
of Vascular Solutions or predictive of actual future results nor should it be construed as financial guidance, and it should not be
relied upon as such. The summary of the projections is not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any shareholder to
vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting or to
influence any shareholder to make any investment decision with respect to the merger, including whether or not to seek dissenters’
rights with respect to shares of our common stock, but solely because the September projections were made available by Vascular
Solutions to Teleflex and our board and the updated projections were used by Guggenheim Securities in connection with the
rendering of its fairness opinion to the board and performing its related financial analyses, as described in the section entitled
“Opinion of Vascular Solutions’ Financial Advisor” and were provided to our board. Vascular Solutions has made no representation
to Teleflex or Merger Sub, in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the projections.

The projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information
regarding Vascular Solutions contained in our public filings with the SEC. The projections

were reviewed by our management with, and considered by, our board in connection with their evaluation and approval of the
merger. The projections are forward-looking statements. For information on factors that may cause our future results to materially
vary, see “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”

Except to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, we do not intend, and expressly disclaim any responsibility,
to update or otherwise revise the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date when Vascular Solutions prepared the
projections or to reflect the occurrence of future events or changes in general economic or industry conditions, even in the event that
any of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in error. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties
inherent in the projections, shareholders are cautioned not to rely on the projections included in this proxy statement.

Certain of the measures included in the projections may be considered non-GAAP financial measures, as noted below. Non-
GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in
compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by Vascular Solutions may not be comparable to similarly titled
amounts used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are included because, in the case of the September projections, they
were supplied to Teleflex and to our board and, in the case of the updated projections, they were used by Guggenheim Securities in
the preparation of its opinion, as described under “—Opinion of Vascular Solutions’ Financial Advisor” and were supplied to our
board.

Opinion of Vascular Solutions’ Financial Advisor

Overview

Our board has retained Guggenheim Securities as its financial advisor in connection with the potential sale of Vascular
Solutions. In selecting Guggenheim Securities as its financial advisor, our board considered that, among other things, Guggenheim
Securities is an internationally recognized investment banking, financial advisory and securities firm whose senior professionals
have substantial experience advising companies in, among other industries, the medical device industry. Guggenheim Securities, as
part of its investment banking, financial advisory and capital markets businesses, is regularly engaged in the valuation and financial
assessment of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, recapitalizations, spin-offs/split-offs,
restructurings, securities offerings in both the private and public capital markets and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

At the December 1, 2016 meeting of our board, Guggenheim Securities rendered an oral opinion, which was confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion, to our board to the effect that, as of December 1, 2016 and based on and subject to the matters
considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review undertaken,
the consideration to be received in connection with the merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of our common
stock (excluding (i) any wholly owned subsidiary of Vascular Solutions or (ii) Teleflex, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates).

This description of Guggenheim Securities’ opinion is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the written opinion, which is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and which you should read carefully and in its entirety. Guggenheim Securities’ written
opinion sets forth the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and
qualifications to the review undertaken by Guggenheim Securities. Guggenheim Securities’ written opinion, which was authorized
for issuance by the Fairness Opinion and Valuation Committee of Guggenheim Securities, is necessarily based on economic, capital
markets and other conditions, and the information made available to Guggenheim Securities, as of the date of such opinion.
Guggenheim Securities has no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on facts, circumstances or events occurring
after the date of the rendering of the opinion.

In reading the discussion of Guggenheim Securities’ opinion set forth below, you should be aware that such opinion (and, as
applicable, any materials provided in connection therewith):

• was provided to our board (in its capacity as such) for its information and assistance in connection with its evaluation of
the consideration to be received in connection with the merger;

• did not constitute a recommendation to our board with respect to the merger;

• does not constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of our common stock as to how to vote or act in connection
with the merger or otherwise;

• did not address Vascular Solutions’ underlying business or financial decision to pursue the merger, the relative merits of
the merger as compared to any alternative business or financial strategies that might exist for Vascular Solutions, the
financing of the merger or the effects of any other transaction in which Vascular Solutions might engage;

• addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the consideration to be
received in connection with the merger by holders of our common stock (excluding (i) any wholly owned subsidiary of
Vascular Solutions or (ii) Teleflex, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) to the extent expressly specified in such
opinion;

• expressed no view or opinion as to (i) any other term, aspect or implication of (a) the merger or the merger agreement
(including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger) or (b) any other agreement, transaction document or
instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or to be entered into or amended in connection with the merger or (ii)
the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the merger to, or of any consideration to be paid to or received by, the holders of
any class of securities (other than as expressly specified in such opinion), creditors or other constituencies of Vascular
Solutions, Teleflex or other participants in the merger; and

• expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation
payable to or to be received by any of Vascular Solutions’ or Teleflex’s directors, officers or employees, or any class of
such persons, in connection with the merger relative to the consideration to be received in connection with the merger or
otherwise.

In the course of performing its reviews and analyses for rendering its opinion, Guggenheim Securities:

• reviewed a draft of the merger agreement dated as of December 1, 2016;

• reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information regarding Vascular Solutions;

• reviewed certain updated non-public business and financial information regarding Vascular Solutions’ business and
prospects, including certain financial projections for Vascular Solutions for the calendar years ending December 31, 2016
through December 31, 2021, referred to as the “updated projections,” all as prepared and provided to Guggenheim
Securities by Vascular Solutions’ senior management. See “—Certain Vascular Solutions Unaudited Prospective Financial
Information;”

• discussed with our senior management their views of Vascular Solutions’ business, operations, historical and projected
financial results and future prospects, including the commercial, competitive and regulatory dynamics in the medical
device industry;

• reviewed the historical prices, trading multiples and trading activity of the shares of our common stock;

• compared the financial performance of Vascular Solutions and the trading multiples and trading activity of the shares of
our common stock with corresponding data for certain other publicly traded companies that Guggenheim Securities
deemed relevant in evaluating Vascular Solutions;

• reviewed the valuation and financial metrics of certain mergers and acquisitions that Guggenheim Securities deemed
relevant in evaluating the merger;

• performed discounted cash flow analyses for Vascular Solutions based on the updated projections; and

• conducted such other studies, analyses, inquiries and investigations as Guggenheim Securities deemed appropriate.

With respect to the information used in arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim Securities notes that:

• Guggenheim Securities relied upon and assumed the accuracy, completeness and reasonableness of all industry, business,
financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, actuarial and other information (including, without limitation, the updated
projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information) furnished by or discussed with Vascular
Solutions or obtained from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties.

• Guggenheim Securities (i) did not assume any responsibility, obligation or liability for the accuracy, completeness,
reasonableness, achievability or independent verification of, and Guggenheim Securities

did not independently verify, any such information (including, without limitation, the updated projections, any other
estimates and any other forward-looking information), (ii) expressed no view, opinion, representation, guaranty or
warranty (in each case, express or implied) regarding the reasonableness or achievability of the updated projections, any
other estimates and any other forward-looking information or the assumptions upon which they are based and (iii) relied
upon the assurances of our senior management that they were unaware of any facts or circumstances that would make
such information (including, without limitation, the updated projections, any other estimates and any other forward-
looking information) incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.

• Specifically, with respect to (i) the updated projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information
furnished by or discussed with Vascular Solutions, (a) Guggenheim Securities was advised by our senior management, and
Guggenheim Securities assumed, that the updated projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking
information utilized in its analyses had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then currently available
estimates and judgments of our senior management as to the expected future performance of Vascular Solutions and (b)
Guggenheim Securities assumed that the updated projections, such other estimates and such other forward-looking
information had been reviewed by our board with the understanding that such information would be used and relied upon
by Guggenheim Securities in connection with rendering its opinion and (ii) any financial projections, other estimates
and/or other forward-looking information obtained by Guggenheim Securities from public sources, data suppliers and
other third parties, Guggenheim Securities assumed that such information was reasonable and reliable.

Guggenheim Securities also noted certain other considerations with respect to its engagement and the rendering of its opinion:

• Guggenheim Securities was asked by our board to solicit indications of interest from selected third parties regarding a
potential transaction with Vascular Solutions, and Guggenheim Securities considered the results of such solicitation in
rendering its opinion.

• Guggenheim Securities did not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including any
contingent, derivative or off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of Vascular Solutions or any other entity or the solvency
or fair value of Vascular Solutions or any other entity, nor was Guggenheim Securities furnished with any such appraisals.

• Guggenheim Securities did not express any view or render any opinion regarding the tax consequences of the merger to
Vascular Solutions or its securityholders. Guggenheim Securities’ professionals are not legal, regulatory, tax, consulting,
accounting, appraisal or actuarial experts and Guggenheim Securities’ opinion should not be construed as constituting
advice with respect to such matters; accordingly, Guggenheim Securities relied on the assessments of Vascular Solutions
and its other advisors with respect to such matters.

• Guggenheim Securities further assumed that:

° in all respects meaningful to its analyses, (i) the final executed form of the merger agreement would not differ from
the draft that Guggenheim Securities reviewed, (ii) each of Vascular Solutions, Teleflex and Merger Sub will comply
with all terms of the merger agreement and (iii) the representations and warranties of Vascular Solutions, Teleflex and
Merger Sub contained in the merger agreement were true and correct and all conditions to the obligations of each
party to the merger agreement to consummate the merger would be satisfied without any waiver, amendment or
modification thereof; and

° the merger will be consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and in
compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements, without any delays, limitations, restrictions,
conditions, waivers, amendments or modifications (regulatory, tax-related or otherwise) that would have an effect on
Vascular Solutions or the merger in any way meaningful to Guggenheim Securities’ analyses and opinion.

• Guggenheim Securities did not express any view or opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of our
common stock or other securities of Vascular Solutions may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time, including
subsequent to the announcement or consummation of the merger.

Summary of Financial Analyses

Overview of Financial Analyses

This “Summary of Financial Analyses” presents a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by Guggenheim
Securities and presented to our board in connection with Guggenheim Securities’ rendering of its opinion. Such presentation to our
board was supplemented by Guggenheim Securities’ oral discussion, the nature and substance of which may not be fully described
herein.

Some of the financial analyses summarized below include summary data and information presented in tabular format. In order
to understand fully such financial analyses, the summary data and tables must be read together with the full text of the summary.
Considering the summary data and tables alone could create a misleading or incomplete view of Guggenheim Securities’ financial
analyses.

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments and determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances involved. A fairness
opinion therefore is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description, and taking portions of the financial analyses
set forth below, without considering such analyses as a whole, would in Guggenheim Securities’ view create an incomplete and
misleading picture of the processes underlying the financial analyses considered in rendering Guggenheim Securities’ opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim Securities:

• based its financial analyses on various assumptions, including assumptions concerning general business and economic
conditions, capital markets considerations and industry-specific and company-specific factors, all of which are beyond the
control of Vascular Solutions, Teleflex and Guggenheim Securities;

• did not form a view or opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor, whether positive or negative, considered in
isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion;

• considered the results of all of its financial analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any one analysis or
factor; and

• ultimately arrived at its opinion based on the results of all of its financial analyses assessed as a whole and believes that
the totality of the factors considered and the various financial analyses performed by Guggenheim Securities in connection
with its opinion operated collectively to support its determination as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as
of the date of such opinion, of the consideration to be received in connection with the merger by the holders of our
common stock (excluding (i) any wholly owned subsidiary of Vascular Solutions or (ii) Teleflex, Merger Sub and their
respective affiliates) to the extent expressly specified in such opinion.

With respect to the financial analyses performed by Guggenheim Securities in connection with rendering its opinion:

• Such financial analyses, particularly those based on estimates and projections, are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.

• None of the selected publicly traded companies used in the selected publicly traded companies analysis described below is
identical or directly comparable to Vascular Solutions, and none of the selected precedent merger and acquisition
transactions used in the selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis described below is identical or
directly comparable to the merger; however, such companies and transactions were selected by Guggenheim Securities,
among other reasons, because they represented or involved target companies which may be considered broadly similar, for
purposes of Guggenheim Securities’ financial analyses, to Vascular Solutions based on Guggenheim Securities’ familiarity
with the medical device industry in the United States.

• In any event, selected publicly traded companies analysis and selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions
analysis are not mathematical; rather, such analyses involve complex considerations and

judgments concerning the differences in business, financial, operating and capital markets-related characteristics and other
factors regarding the selected publicly traded companies and selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions to
which Vascular Solutions and the merger were compared.

present time or at any time in the future.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Guggenheim Securities calculated, among other things, various public market trading multiples for Vascular Solutions and the
selected publicly traded companies (in the case of the selected publicly traded companies, based on Wall Street equity research
consensus estimates and each company’s most recent publicly available financial filings), which are summarized in the table below:

Selected Publicly Traded Company Multiples

(1) Calculated using closing stock price on 11/15/16, which represents the last full trading day before sell-side analyst interaction with the CEO of Vascular
Solutions. See “—Background of the Merger.”

In performing its selected publicly traded companies analysis:

• Guggenheim Securities selected a trading enterprise value/2017E revenue multiple reference range of 3.25x – 4.50x for
purposes of evaluating Vascular Solutions on a stand-alone public market trading basis.

• Guggenheim Securities’ analysis of the selected publicly traded companies resulted in an overall reference range of $37.50
– $51.00 per share for purposes of evaluating our common stock on a stand-alone public market trading basis.

• Guggenheim Securities noted that the merger price of $56.00 per share was above the foregoing public market trading
reference range based on the selected publicly traded companies analysis.

Selected Precedent Merger and Acquisition Transactions Analysis. Guggenheim Securities reviewed and analyzed certain
financial metrics associated with two categories of selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions that Guggenheim
Securities deemed relevant for purposes of this analysis:

• Primary precedent merger and acquisition transactions: selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions announced
since 2011 involving a US-target company in the medical device sector (excluding transactions involving a target
company that was an original equipment manufacturer) with transaction values from $500 million to $2 billion, target
company forward revenue growth rates ~10% to ~22% and target company forward gross margins of greater than 60%, as
a general matter, such target companies had relatively low or no positive forward EBITDA.

• Other precedent merger and acquisition transactions for informational reference purposes: selected recent precedent
merger and acquisition transactions involving a target company in the medical device sector in which the target companies
had lower forward revenue growth profiles but had meaningful positive forward EBITDA.

Guggenheim Securities calculated, among other things and to the extent publicly available, certain implied change-of-control
transaction multiples for the selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions (based on Wall Street equity research consensus
estimates, each company’s most recent publicly available financial filings and certain other publicly available information), which
are summarized in the table below:

Selected Precedent Merger and Acquisition Transaction Multiples

Primary Precedent M&A Transactions

Transaction
Value / NTM

Revenue
Median of Primary Precedent M&A Transactions  3.90x

In performing its selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis with respect to the primary precedent merger
and acquisition transactions:

• Guggenheim Securities selected an overall transaction enterprise value/NTM revenue multiple reference range of 3.50x –
6.50x for purposes of evaluating Vascular Solutions on a change-of-control basis, which implied an overall reference range
of approximately $39.75 – $71.75 per share of our common stock.

• Within the foregoing overall transaction enterprise value/NTM revenue multiple reference range of 3.50x – 6.50x,
Guggenheim Securities focused more specifically on a transaction enterprise value/NTM

TABLE OF CONTENTS

revenue multiple reference range of 4.51x – 4.99x, which was based on the transaction enterprise value/NTM revenue
multiples attendant to the two most recent precedent merger and acquisition transactions (each of which involved target
companies with forward revenue growth rates similar to that of Vascular Solutions) and which implied a reference range
of approximately $50.50 – $55.75 per share of our common stock. Guggenheim Securities noted that the merger
consideration of $56.00 per share was above the foregoing change-of-control transaction reference range based on this
subset of the primary precedent merger and acquisition transactions.

With respect to its analysis of the other precedent merger and acquisition transactions for informational reference purposes,
Guggenheim Securities noted that the transaction enterprise value/NTM EBITDA multiples for the Teleflex/Vascular Solutions
merger were well above the transaction enterprise value/NTM EBITDA multiples attendant to such other precedent merger and
acquisition transactions.

Discounted Cash Flow Analyses. Guggenheim Securities performed illustrative stand-alone discounted cash flow analyses of
Vascular Solutions based on projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows (after deduction of stock-based compensation) for
Vascular Solutions and an estimate of its terminal/continuing value at the end of the projection horizon. In performing its illustrative
discounted cash flow analyses:

• Guggenheim Securities based its discounted cash flow analyses on the updated projections.

• Guggenheim Securities based its primary discounted cash flow analyses on a probability-adjusted case derived from the
updated projections as derived by Vascular Solutions’ senior management and furnished to Guggenheim Securities, with
the probability-adjusted case assuming a 75% probability of success, per direction provided by Vascular Solutions
management, applied to our RePlas freeze dried plasma product and our large bore closure product, with research and
development costs weighted at 100%. For informational reference purposes only, Guggenheim Securities also performed
discounted cash flow analyses based on the updated projections (which were not probability adjusted).

• Guggenheim Securities used a discount rate range of 9.40% – 11.40% based on its estimate of Vascular Solutions’
weighted average cost of capital.

• In calculating Vascular Solutions’ terminal/continuing value for purposes of its discounted cash flow analyses,
Guggenheim Securities used a two-stage terminal/continuing value methodology based on an illustrative reference range
of perpetual growth rates of Vascular Solutions’ steady-state terminal year normalized after-tax unlevered free cash flow
of 2.0% – 3.0%.

• Guggenheim Securities’ illustrative discounted cash flow analyses on a probability-adjusted basis resulted in an overall
reference range of $38.50 – $55.25 per share for purposes of evaluating our common stock on a stand-alone intrinsic-value
basis. Guggenheim Securities noted that the merger price of $56.00 per share was above the foregoing discounted cash
flow-based reference range based on the illustrative discounted cash flow analyses on a probability-adjusted basis.

• For informational reference purposes only, Guggenheim Securities’ illustrative discounted cash flow analyses on a non-
probability-adjusted basis resulted in an overall reference range of $41.75 – $60.50 per share for purposes of evaluating
our common stock on a stand-alone intrinsic-value basis. Guggenheim Securities noted that the merger price of $56.00 per
share was toward the high end of the foregoing discounted cash flow-based reference range based on the illustrative
discounted cash flow analyses on a non-probability-adjusted basis.

Other Financial Reviews and Analyses for Informational Reference Purposes

In order to provide certain context for the financial analyses in connection with its opinion as described above, Guggenheim
Securities undertook various additional financial reviews and analyses as summarized below for informational reference purposes.
As a general matter, Guggenheim Securities did not consider such additional financial reviews and analyses to be determinative
methodologies for purposes of its opinion.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Vascular Solutions’ Stock Price Trading History. Guggenheim Securities reviewed Vascular Solutions’ stock price trading
history over various timeframes:

• Among other things, Guggenheim Securities noted that the merger price of $56.00 exceeded (i) the all-time intraday high
price for our common stock of $55.30, (ii) the closing price of our common stock of $55.10 on November 30, 2016, the
last trading day prior to execution of the merger agreement, (iii) the unaffected stock price of our common stock of $49.90
on November 15, 2016 and (iv) the 20-day unaffected VWAP for our common stock of $47.10 for the period ending
November 15, 2016. The “unaffected stock price” refers to the closing price of our stock on November 15, 2016, the
trading day before the day a sell-side analyst indicated to our chief executive officer an awareness of the confidential
process being undertaken by Vascular Solutions to evaluate strategic. The “20-day unaffected VWAP” refers to the 20-day
VWAP for the period ending on November 15, 2016. See “—Background of the Merger.”

• Guggenheim Securities also noted that Vascular Solutions had significantly outperformed its peer index over the three
months prior to the execution of the merger agreement, including reaching an all-time high intraday stock price on
November 30, 2016.

Vascular Solutions Wall Street Equity Research Analyst Price Targets. Guggenheim Securities reviewed selected Wall Street
equity research analyst price targets for Vascular Solutions:

• Guggenheim Securities noted that the range of selected Wall Street equity research analyst price targets for our common
stock was $49.00 — $58.00 per share, or approximately $44.25 — $52.50 per share on a present value basis (as of
November 30, 2016) using an illustrative discount rate 10.62% (which reflected Guggenheim Securities’ estimate of the
midpoint of Vascular Solutions’ cost of equity). For comparison purposes, Guggenheim Securities noted that the merger
price of $56.00 per share was above the foregoing equity research price target range for Vascular Solutions.

• Guggenheim Securities noted that the public market trading price targets published by Wall Street equity research analysts
do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for our common stock, and such estimates are subject to various
uncertainties, including the future financial performance of Vascular Solutions and future capital markets conditions.

Other Considerations

Except as described in the summary above, Vascular Solutions did not provide specific instructions to, or place any limitations
on, Guggenheim Securities with respect to the procedures to be followed or factors to be considered in performing its financial
analyses or providing its opinion. The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger were determined through
negotiations between Vascular Solutions and Teleflex and were approved by our board. The decision to enter into the merger
agreement was solely that of our board. Guggenheim Securities’ opinion was just one of the many factors taken into consideration
by our board. Consequently, Guggenheim Securities’ financial analyses should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of our
board with respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Vascular Solutions common stock of the
consideration to be received pursuant to the merger.

Pursuant to the terms of Guggenheim Securities’ engagement letter, Vascular Solutions has agreed to pay Guggenheim
Securities a cash transaction fee (based on a percentage of the aggregate consideration involved in the merger) upon consummation
of the merger, which cash transaction fee currently is estimated to be approximately $15,460,000. In connection with Guggenheim
Securities engagement, a cash milestone fee of $1,000,000 became payable upon delivery of Guggenheim Securities’ opinion,
which will be credited against the foregoing cash transaction fee. In addition, Vascular Solutions has agreed to reimburse
Guggenheim Securities for certain expenses and to indemnify Guggenheim Securities against certain liabilities arising out of its
engagement.

Other than Guggenheim Securities’ current engagement with Vascular Solutions, Guggenheim Securities has not during the
past two years been formally engaged to provide any investment banking or financial advisory services to, or received any
investment banking or financial advisory fees from, either Vascular Solutions or Teleflex. As previously disclosed to our board,
however, during the past two years Guggenheim Securities has maintained relationships with both Vascular Solutions and Teleflex,
has performed certain work on behalf of Teleflex (including a preliminary analysis of the Company’s weighted average cost of
capital prepared by Guggenheim Securities in July 2016) and may seek to provide Vascular Solutions, Teleflex and their respective

affiliates with certain financial advisory and investment banking services unrelated to the merger in the future, for which services
Guggenheim Securities would expect to receive compensation.

Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities engage in a wide range of financial services activities for its and
their own accounts and the accounts of its and their customers, including: asset, investment and wealth management; insurance
services; investment banking, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring; merchant banking; fixed income and
equity sales, trading and research; and derivatives, foreign exchange and futures. In the ordinary course of these activities,
Guggenheim Securities or its affiliates and related entities may (i) provide such financial services to Vascular Solutions, Teleflex,
other participants in the merger or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio companies, for which
services Guggenheim Securities or any of its affiliates and related entities has received, and may receive, compensation and (ii)
directly or indirectly, hold long or short positions, trade and otherwise conduct such activities in or with respect to certain bank debt,
debt or equity securities and derivative products of or relating to Vascular Solutions, Teleflex, other participants in the merger or
their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio companies. Furthermore, Guggenheim Securities or its
affiliates and related entities and its or their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents may have investments
in Vascular Solutions, Teleflex, other participants in the merger or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and
portfolio companies.

Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory guidelines, Guggenheim Securities has adopted certain policies and procedures
to establish and maintain the independence of its research departments and personnel. As a result, Guggenheim Securities’ research
analysts may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and publish research reports with respect to Vascular
Solutions, Teleflex, other participants in the merger or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio
companies and the merger that differ from the views of Guggenheim Securities’ investment banking personnel.

Financing of the Merger

We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to consummate the merger and the related transactions will be funded by
Teleflex, all or a portion of which may be funded through the debt financing transactions described in the next paragraph, including
the funds needed to (i) pay our shareholders the amounts due to them under the merger agreement; (ii) make payments in respect of
Vascular Solutions’ outstanding restricted stock and stock options pursuant to the merger agreement; and (iii) pay all fees and
expenses payable by Teleflex and Merger Sub under the merger agreement and in connection with the debt facility described below.
The merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Teleflex. Teleflex will fund the transaction through the proceeds from
one or more debt financing transactions.

While Teleflex’s obligations under the merger agreement are not subject to any financing condition, Teleflex has entered into a
debt commitment letter, referred to as the “commitment letter,” with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., referred to as “JPMorgan,” dated
December 1, 2016, which was amended and restated on December 20, 2016 to add Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith and PNC Bank, National Association, referred to collectively, together with JPMorgan, as the “commitment
parties,” as additional commitment parties and lead arrangers. Pursuant to the commitment letter, the commitment parties have
committed (i) to provide a $750 million senior unsecured bridge facility and (ii) to backstop an amendment to Teleflex’s existing
credit agreement, dated July 16, 2013, with the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan as administrative agent, referred to as the
“existing credit agreement,” in order to permit the bridge facility and to make certain other changes to the existing credit agreement,
collectively referred to as the “debt financing.” The agents, arrangers, lenders and other entities that have committed to provide or
arrange all or any part of the debt financing or any other financing to be obtained by Teleflex (or any of its affiliates) in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the parties to any joinder agreements, incremental
agreements, credit agreements or loan agreements entered into in connection therewith, and their respective successors and assigns
are collectively referred to as the “financing sources.” The actual documentation governing the debt financing has not been
finalized, and accordingly, the actual terms may differ from the description of such terms in the commitment letter. In connection
with the debt financing, we have agreed to provide certain required information prior to commencement of the marketing period, as
described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—When the Merger Becomes Effective; Marketing Period.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Interests of Vascular Solutions’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of our board that you vote for the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement,
you should be aware that certain of our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or
in addition to, your interests as a shareholder. Our board was aware of these interests in approving the merger agreement and the
merger and in recommending that the merger agreement be approved and adopted by our shareholders.

For purposes of this proxy statement, our named executive officers consist of (i) Howard Root, (ii) James Hennen, (iii) Chad
Kugler, (iv) Carrie Powers, (v) William Rutstein, and (vi) Charmaine Sutton. The compensation that may become payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger is subject to approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, by our
shareholders, as described below in the section entitled “Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation
(Proposal 2).”

Treatment of Equity Awards

Under the merger agreement, the equity-based awards held by our directors and executive officers under our stock plans will be
treated as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Vascular Solutions’ Equity Awards and the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan.”

The following table sets forth the number of shares of restricted stock and the number of shares underlying stock options,
whether vested or unvested, held by our non-employee directors and executive officers as of January 17, 2017 and the amount of
merger consideration that will be payable in connection therewith upon settlement of the outstanding equity awards as of the
effective time of the merger.

(1) Ms. Sutton is a former executive officer who resigned effective as of March 31, 2016.

Employment Agreements, Separation Agreements, Termination and Change in Control Payments

We have entered into employment agreements with each of the named executive officers. The employment agreements provide
for employment “at will,” which may be terminated by either party for any reason upon ten business days’ prior written notice. The
base salary and bonus for each of the named executive officers are determined by the compensation committee of our board. During
the term of his or her employment agreement and for a period of one year after termination, each named executive officer is
prohibited from competing with us individually or in any entity whose business is directly competitive with our business.

The employment agreements provide for certain payments and benefits to the named executive officers if a named executive
officer’s employment is terminated (i) within 12 months following a “change in control” by us without “cause” or by the named
executive officer for “good reason” or (ii) by us without “cause” prior to a

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1030206/000156761917000061/s001489x2_defm14a.htm 57/162

TABLE OF CONTENTS

“change in control” at the request or insistence of any person (other than the Company) in connection with a “change in control,”
which we refer to as the change in control severance payments. “Cause” is generally defined in the employment agreements as
willful and continued failure by the named executive officer to substantially perform his or her duties, breach of the employment
agreement or willful engagement in misconduct materially injurious to Vascular Solutions. “Good reason” is generally defined in the
employment agreements as a change in the named executive officer’s responsibilities, a reduction in base salary, an amendment to
the cash incentive compensation program that is adverse to the interest of the named executive officer, the failure to provide
substantially similar benefits or a relocation of more than 50 miles from the named executive officer’s principal office, in each case,
as compared to prior to a “change in control,” or the failure by any successor company to assume the obligations under the
employment agreement. “Change in control” is generally defined as an acquisition of 50% or more of the combined voting power of
our outstanding securities by any person or group, shareholder approval of (x) a merger pursuant to which shares of our stock would
be converted into cash, securities or other property, (y) a sale of assets or (z) dissolution of Vascular Solutions or the replacement of
a majority of our board with directors not recommended by the existing board. The employment agreements provide that the change
in control severance payments are payable, at our discretion, in a lump sum payment or in periodic payments in accordance with our
normal payroll practices in effect from time-to-time following termination in amounts equal to 24 times monthly base salary in the
case of Howard Root and 12 times monthly base salary for the other named executive officers. Mr. Root’s employment agreement,
which was entered into in January 2012, also provides for payments to be made to Mr. Root equal to 12 times his monthly base
salary in the event that we terminate Mr. Root’s employment without cause at any time, except within 12 months following a change
in control.

Our named executive officers hold options to purchase shares of our common stock, which we refer to as stock options, and
shares of restricted stock, which we refer to as restricted stock, each of which were granted pursuant to the Vascular Solutions, Inc.
Stock Option and Stock Award Plan. Pursuant to the Incentive Stock Option Agreement used for grants of stock options and the
Restricted Stock Award Agreement used for grants of restricted stock, all outstanding unvested stock options vest and become
exercisable and restricted stock vests upon a “change in control,” which has a definition similar to the definition in the employment
agreements above, with an additional criteria that the majority of the existing members of the our board may make the
determination, in their discretion, that a change of control has occurred.

Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Vascular Solutions’ Named Executive Officers

The table below shows the estimated compensation that each named executive officer would receive assuming that the merger
was consummated and each such named executive officer’s employment was terminated by Vascular Solutions without cause or by
the named executive officer for good reason on January 17, 2017.

The amounts reflected in the table and the footnotes are determined using a per-share price for our common stock of $56.00, as
specified in the merger agreement. The compensation summarized in the table and footnotes below in respect of the named
executive officers is subject to approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, by our shareholders, as described below in the section
entitled “Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation (Proposal 2).”

The calculations in the tables below do not include amounts the named executive officers were already entitled to receive or
that were vested as of January 17, 2017, or amounts under contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements to the extent they do not
discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of a named executive officer and that are available generally to all of our salaried
employees. The estimated amounts below are based on multiple assumptions that may not actually occur, including assumptions
described in this proxy statement. In addition, certain amounts will vary depending on the actual date of closing of the merger,
which is presently expected to occur in the first half of 2017. As a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by an applicable
individual may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below.

For purposes of this discussion, “single-trigger” refers to amounts triggered by a change in control for which payment is not
conditioned upon the named executive officer’s termination without cause or resignation for good reason and “double-trigger” refers
to amounts triggered by a change in control for which payment is conditioned upon such a termination or resignation of the named
executive officer.

and will convert into the right to receive cash upon the closing of the merger, as described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of
Vascular Solutions’ Equity Awards and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.” The amounts are determined as of January 17, 2017 and some of the outstanding
unvested stock options and outstanding restricted stock are scheduled to vest before the closing date. Any such unvested stock options and restricted stock that
vest before the closing date will no longer be counted as golden parachute payments at closing, but are included in the calculations here. The stock options and
restricted stock awards are “single-trigger.”
The following table lists the portion of the value set forth in the “Equity” column in the table above attributable to each type of accelerated equity held by the
named executive officers:

Named Executive Officers

William Rutstein  — $ 929,208 $ 929,208 
Charmaine Sutton  —  —  — 

(3) This amount represents accrued vacation and was determined by taking the named executive officer’s yearly base salary and dividing that amount by 2,080
hours using a standard 40-hour work week and a 52 week year. This hourly salary rate was then multiplied by the hours of vacation the named executive
officers’ had available to them at January 17, 2017. All of the accrued benefits amounts are payable upon a termination of employment within 12 months
following a change in control.

(4) Ms. Sutton is a former named executive officer who resigned effective as of March 31, 2016. Ms. Sutton will not be entitled to receive any payments or
benefits in connection with the consummation of the merger, either alone or in connection with any other event.

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers

For not less than six years from and after the effective time, the surviving company is required to (and Teleflex is required to
cause the surviving company to) indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors and officers of Vascular Solutions and
our subsidiaries (each referred to as an “indemnified party”) against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable
attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim suit, proceeding or investigation to
each indemnified party subject to such indemnified party agreeing to return any such funds which a court has determined in a final,
non-appealable judgment such indemnified party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in respect
of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of the merger agreement, the consummation of the merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time, in connection with such
persons serving as an officer or director of Vascular Solutions or any of our subsidiaries or serving at the request of Vascular
Solutions or any of our subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another person, to the fullest extent permitted by law
or provided pursuant to Vascular Solutions’ governing documents or the organizational documents of any Vascular Solutions
subsidiary or any other agreement, if any, in existence on the date of the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Teleflex and Merger Sub have also agreed that, for six years after the effective time, all rights to elimination or limitation of
liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time, now
existing in favor of the indemnified parties as provided in Vascular Solutions or our subsidiaries charter documents or any other
agreement will survive the merger and continue in full force and effect. The surviving company’s charter documents will not contain
any provisions contradictory or otherwise adverse to such rights or be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such indemnified party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
the merger agreement, the consummation of the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement)
without the consent of such indemnified party.

Teleflex has also agreed to either (i) cause the surviving company to provide, for a period of not less than six years from the
effective time, a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy that is no less favorable than the Company’s existing policy as of
the date of the merger agreement or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage, with
an annual cost not in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of the merger agreement referred to as the
“D&O insurance,” covering acts or omissions at or prior to the effective time with respect to those persons who are covered by the
D&O insurance as of the effective time, or (ii) at Teleflex’s option, Vascular Solutions or surviving company may obtain, a single
premium tail coverage with respect to D&O insurance with an annual cost not in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid
prior to the date of the merger agreement.

Teleflex and the surviving company are required to make proper provision for the continuation of these rights in connection
with certain future corporate transactions.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as
defined below) of our common stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion does not address
U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to holders other than U.S. holders. This discussion is based on the provisions of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to as the “Code,” applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial
opinions and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, referred to as the “IRS,” each as in
effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, and
any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This
discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences.
This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the
Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, nor does it address any tax considerations under state, local or foreign laws
or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax. This discussion is not binding on the IRS or the
courts and, therefore, could be subject to challenge, which could be sustained. No ruling will be sought from the IRS with respect to
the merger.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:

• a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

• a corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

• a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration, and one
or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) such trust has a valid election in
effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of our common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to consider
all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1030206/000156761917000061/s001489x2_defm14a.htm 60/162

TABLE OF CONTENTS

U.S. holder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal
income tax laws (including, for example, insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in
securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that
have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, tax-qualified retirement plans, banks and other
financial institutions, mutual funds, certain expatriates, S corporations, or other pass-through entities, or investors in such S
corporations or other pass-through entities, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, U.S. holders who hold
shares of our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction, U.S. holders
who will hold (actually or constructively) an equity interest in Teleflex immediately after the merger, and U.S. holders who acquired
their shares of our common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements).

If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of
the partners and the activities of the partnership. If you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a partner in a partnership holding
shares of our common stock, you should consult your tax advisor.

This summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice.
Holders of our common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to
them of the merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the unearned income Medicare
contribution tax and any other U.S. federal, or state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who receives cash
in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.

Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of our common stock
surrendered in the merger is greater than one year as of the date of the merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate
holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of our common stock at different times and different prices,
such U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each block of our
common stock.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Payments made in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain
circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S.
holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the applicable withholding agent a properly
completed and executed IRS Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, that the taxpayer identification number
provided is correct and that such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or
credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to
the IRS in a timely manner.

Regulatory Approvals

Under Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, referred to as the “HSR Act,” and the rules
promulgated thereunder, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until notifications have been given and
information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, referred to as the “Antitrust Division,”
and the United States Federal Trade Commission, referred to as the “FTC,” and all statutory waiting period requirements have been
satisfied. Completion of the merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.
Under the HSR Act, the merger may not be completed until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period, which begins when

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Teleflex and Vascular Solutions file Premerger Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division, unless such waiting period is earlier terminated by the FTC and the Antitrust Division. Teleflex and Vascular Solutions
filed their Premerger Notification and Report Forms on December 15, 2016 in connection with the merger, and the waiting period
expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 17, 2017.

At any time (regardless of whether before or after the expiration or termination of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR
Act, or before or after the effective time), the Antitrust Division or the FTC may take action under the antitrust laws, including
seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, to rescind the merger or to conditionally permit completion of the merger subject to
regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition, U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws as they
deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or
permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws
under some circumstances. Although neither Vascular Solutions nor Teleflex believes that the merger will violate the antitrust laws,
there can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it
would not be successful.

Delisting and Deregistration of Vascular Solutions Common Stock

If the merger is completed, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

The Merger Agreement Proposal

We are asking you to approve a proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement. For a detailed discussion of
the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the merger
agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.

Vote Required and Board Recommendation

Under Minnesota Law, approval of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to be cast on the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement.
Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.

As discussed in the section entitled “—Reasons for our Board’s Recommendation in Favor of the Merger,” and after
considering various factors described in such section, our board has determined that the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Vascular Solutions
and its shareholders and resolved to recommend that Vascular Solutions shareholders vote in favor of the approval of the merger and
adoption of the merger agreement. Accordingly, our board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to
approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this document as
Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this document. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not
contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the merger
agreement in its entirety, as the rights and obligations of the parties thereto are governed by the express terms of the merger
agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this document.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The following summary of the merger agreement, and the copy of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this
document, are intended to provide information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and are not intended to provide any
factual information about Vascular Solutions or modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Vascular Solutions in its public

relied upon as, disclosures regarding any facts and circumstances relating to Vascular Solutions. The merger agreement contains
representations and warranties by and covenants of Vascular Solutions, Teleflex and Merger Sub that were made only for purposes
of that agreement and as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made
solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties,
including being qualified by confidential disclosures and being made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the
parties to the merger agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to contractual standards of
materiality or material adverse effect applicable to the contracting parties that generally differ from those applicable to investors. In
addition, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the
merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Vascular Solutions’ public disclosures. The
representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement and any descriptions thereof should be read in conjunction with
the disclosures in Vascular Solutions’ periodic and current reports, proxy statements and other documents filed with the SEC. See
the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.” Moreover, the description of the merger agreement below does
not purport to describe all of the terms of such agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such
agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex A and is incorporated herein by reference.

Additional information about Vascular Solutions may be found elsewhere in this document and Vascular Solutions’ other
public filings. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

Structure of the Merger; Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers

At the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and into Vascular Solutions, and the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub will cease. Vascular Solutions will be the surviving company in the merger and will continue its corporate existence as a
Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Teleflex.

At the effective time, the articles of incorporation of Vascular Solutions will be amended and restated in their entirety to be
identical to the form attached as Exhibit A to the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A hereto, and such articles will be
the articles of incorporation of the surviving company. Also at the effective time, the bylaws of Vascular Solutions will be amended
and restated in their entirety to be identical to the form attached as Exhibit B to the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A
hereto, and such bylaws will be the bylaws of the surviving company.

At the effective time, the individuals holding positions as directors of Merger Sub immediately before the effective time will
become the initial directors of the surviving company, and the individuals holding positions as officers of Vascular Solutions
immediately before the effective time will continue as the initial officers of the surviving company.

When the Merger Becomes Effective; Marketing Period

The closing of the merger will take place at 10:00 a.m. Central Time at the offices of Dorsey & Whitney LLP, 50 S. Sixth
Street, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by applicable law) of the conditions set forth in the merger

agreement to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). However, if the marketing period (as summarized below), has not ended
at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of such closing conditions, the closing will occur on the earlier of (i) a date during the
marketing period specified by Teleflex on no fewer than two business days' notice to Vascular Solutions, which may be conditioned
upon the simultaneous completion of the financing and (ii) the second business day following the end of the marketing period.

At the closing, the articles of merger will be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota. The merger will
become effective at the time when the articles of merger are filed or at such later time on the closing date as may be agreed by
Vascular Solutions and Merger Sub and specified in the articles of merger.

The “marketing period” refers to the first period of 15 consecutive business days beginning upon Teleflex’s receipt of certain
information required by the debt commitment letter, which information we refer to as the “required information,” and throughout
which no condition exists that would cause any of the closing conditions to the obligations of each party (as described in the section
entitled “—Conditions to Completion of the Merger”) to fail to be satisfied, assuming the closing were to be scheduled for any time
during such period (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to such conditions
being able to be satisfied). However, the marketing period will not be deemed to have commenced if, after the date of the merger
agreement and prior to the completion of the marketing period: (1) our auditor has withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any
audited financial statements contained in the required information, in which case the marketing period will not be deemed to
commence unless and until a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with respect to such financial statements; or (2) Vascular
Solutions has publicly announced any intention to restate any historical financial statements of Vascular Solutions included in the
required information or that such restatement is under consideration, in which case the marketing period will not be deemed to
commence unless and until such restatement has been completed and the applicable required information has been amended or
Vascular Solutions has publicly announced that it has concluded no such restatement is required; or (3) the required information
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained in such required information not materially misleading, in which case the marketing period will not be deemed to
commence until all such required information has been corrected or disclosed. In addition, if Vascular Solutions fails to file with the
SEC any forms, certifications, schedules, exhibits, documents and reports required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC on or
prior to the date required therefor under the Exchange Act, the marketing period will not be deemed to have commenced unless and
until, at the earliest, such document has been so filed. The marketing period will be deemed to have ended on any date that the
initial funding of Teleflex’s debt financing occurs.

Effect of the Merger on the Common Stock

At the effective time, each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than cancelled
shares and dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. The merger consideration will be
$56.00 per share in cash, without interest, and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

At the effective time, each cancelled share will be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the surviving company. Each dissenting share will be entitled only to payment of the fair value of the share (including interest
determined in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act); however, if the holder of any
dissenting share fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to dissent under the dissenters’ rights provisions of
the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s dissenting shares
will cease and such dissenting shares will be deemed to have been converted as of the effective time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the merger consideration. For more information regarding dissenters’ rights, see the
section entitled “Dissenters’ Rights.”

At the effective time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the surviving company, and such shares, together with
the cancelled shares, will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving company.

Treatment of Vascular Solutions’ Equity Awards and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Restricted Stock. At the effective time, each share of our common stock issued under our equity compensation plans, and then-
subject to restrictions of forfeiture under our equity compensation plans, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration (subject to any applicable withholding tax).

Stock Options. At the effective time, each option to purchase our common stock, referred to as a “stock option,” that is
outstanding, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (subject to
deduction for any applicable withholding tax) equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of our common stock subject to
such stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (y) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise
price per share of such stock option.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Vascular Solutions Employee Stock Purchase Plan, referred to as the “ESPP,” has been
amended such that (i) participation following the date of the merger agreement will be limited to those employees who are
participating in the ESPP as of such date; (ii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the ESPP, participants may not
increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of the merger agreement; (iii) no offering
period will be commenced after the date of the merger agreement; (iv) each participant’s outstanding right to purchase shares of our
common stock under the ESPP will terminate on the day immediately prior to the day on which the effective time of the merger
occurs; provided that amounts allocated to each participant’s account under the ESPP as of such date will be used to purchase shares
of common stock using such date as the final purchase date; and (v) the ESPP will terminate immediately following the purchase of
such shares.

Payment for Common Stock in the Merger

Prior to the closing of the merger, Teleflex will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to Vascular Solutions, referred to as the “Paying Agent,” sufficient funds to pay the aggregate merger consideration.
Promptly after the effective time, Teleflex and the surviving company will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record
of shares of our common stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration (1) a letter of
transmittal and (2) instructions for effecting the surrender of certificates or book-entry shares formerly representing shares of our
common stock in exchange for the merger consideration. Upon (i) surrender of certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu of
certificates and, if required, the posting of a bond) to the Paying Agent together with the letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions to the letter of transmittal or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying
Agent (or such other evidence as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), the holder of such certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu of certificates) or book-entry shares will be entitled to receive the merger consideration for all such shares.

Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by materiality or knowledge qualifications or

For purposes of the merger agreement, a “material adverse effect” with respect to Vascular Solutions means any change, effect,

has had a disproportionate impact on Vascular Solutions and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared to other participants in the
medical device industry):

• changes generally affecting the United States or global economic conditions;

• changes generally affecting the medical device industry;

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger

The merger agreement provides that, during the period from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the effective
time of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, such period referred to as the “pre-closing period,” except as
Teleflex will otherwise consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), as expressly required
pursuant to the merger agreement, as set forth in the disclosure schedules or as required by applicable law, we will, and will cause
our subsidiaries to, conduct our and their businesses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and we will use
our commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact our and our subsidiaries’ present business organizations, to keep available the
services of our and our subsidiaries’ current officers and employees and to preserve our and our subsidiaries’ present relationships
with material customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors, wholesalers, lessors and other persons with whom we and our
subsidiaries have material business relations.

The merger agreement further provides that, during such period, except as Teleflex otherwise consents (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), as expressly permitted or required pursuant to the merger agreement or set forth in
the disclosure schedule or as required by applicable law or judgment, we will not, and will not cause our subsidiaries not to, subject
in each case to certain specified exceptions:

• amend or otherwise change our charter documents, or otherwise alter our corporate structure through merger, liquidation,
reorganization or otherwise;

No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals

We and our board will generally not be permitted to solicit or participate in discussions regarding any inquiry, indication of
interest or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a competing proposal. For purposes of the merger agreement:

• “competing proposal” means any inquiry, proposal or offer made by a person or group (other than a proposal or offer by
Teleflex or any of its subsidiaries) at any time, including any amendment or modification to any existing proposal or offer,
relating to, whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions (or which is otherwise structured to permit) (i)
such person or group to acquire direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least 15% of the assets (as determined on a
book value basis) of, equity interest in, or businesses of, Vascular Solutions (whether pursuant to a merger, consolidation
or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise,
including any single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions), or (ii) a merger, consolidation,
recapitalization or other transaction that results in the shareholders of Vascular Solutions immediately preceding such
transaction holding less than 85% of the equity interests of the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, in each
case other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

• “superior proposal” means a bona fide, written competing proposal (with references to 15% and 85% being deemed to be
references to 50%), which our board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, determines in good faith after consultation
with outside legal and financial advisors to be more favorable to the shareholders of Vascular Solutions from a financial
point of view than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, taking into account all relevant factors
(including the financing (including availability thereof) and regulatory aspects of such competing proposal, the likelihood
and timing of consummation thereof (as compared to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) and all other
terms and conditions of such competing proposal and the merger agreement (including any changes to the terms of the
merger agreement proposed by Teleflex in response to such competing proposal or otherwise)).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Except as permitted by the merger agreement, during the pre-closing period, the merger agreement requires that we will not
and will cause our subsidiaries, directors and officer not to, and will use our reasonable best efforts to cause our other
representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the submission or announcement of any competing
proposal;

• participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any nonpublic information relating to Vascular Solutions
or our subsidiaries in connection with any competing proposal or any proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a competing proposal;

• engage in discussions with any third party with respect to any competing proposal or any proposal or offer that constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a competing proposal;

• approve or recommend, propose publicly to approve or recommend, or fail to timely recommend against, any competing
proposal;

• withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or otherwise propose publicly to withdraw, change, amend, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Teleflex, our board recommendation; or

• enter into any letter of intent or other document or agreement relating to, or any agreement or commitment providing for,
any competing proposal.

Notwithstanding these restrictions, which we refer to as the “no-shop restrictions,” if at any time prior to the time the requisite
shareholder vote is obtained, we receive a bona fide, written competing proposal that did not result from a material breach of the no-
shop restrictions, we may furnish nonpublic information to such third party and engage in discussions or negotiations with such
third party with respect to the competing proposal if (A) our board has determined in good faith, after consultation with our outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that such competing proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to constitute a
superior proposal; and (B) any nonpublic information furnished to such third party is (1) subject to a confidentiality agreement that
contains terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to Teleflex than those contained in our confidentiality agreement with
Teleflex, and (2) any such nonpublic information has previously been provided to Teleflex or is provided to Teleflex prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time such nonpublic information is furnished to such third party.

During the pre-closing period, we are also required to promptly (and in any event within two days after the occurrence thereof)
advise Teleflex of (i) the receipt of any competing proposal or any proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to lead to a competing proposal, which notice will include the identity of the Person making such proposal or offer and copies of all
proposals, offers and drafts of proposed agreements related thereto; (ii) any change to the financial or other material terms and
conditions of any competing proposal and must otherwise keep Teleflex reasonably informed of the status of any such competing
proposal (including by providing copies of all proposals, offers and drafts of proposed agreements related thereto that have not
already been provided pursuant to clause (i) above); and (iii) the receipt of any request for non-public information relating to us or
our subsidiaries or any of our subsidiaries’ properties, books or records by any person in connection with a competing proposal or a
proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a competing proposal. Neither we nor our subsidiaries will, after the
date of the merger agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit us or our subsidiaries from
providing such information to Teleflex, or terminate, waive or amend any provision of any existing “standstill” agreement with
respect to the submission of any competing proposal except to allow a third party to make a confidential competing proposal to our
board.

Change in Board Recommendation

As described in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Reasons for our Board’s Recommendation in Favor of the
Merger,” and subject to the provisions described below, our board has unanimously recommended that our shareholders vote
“FOR” the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement. We refer in this document to the recommendation of
our board that shareholders approve this merger agreement as the “board recommendation.” We refer to the board recommendation
and the approval of the merger by our board of directors together as the “board actions.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The merger agreement provides that, except as described below, our board may not (any of the following, a “change of
recommendation”):

• approve or recommend, propose publicly to approve or recommend, or fail to timely recommend against, any competing
proposal; or

• withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or otherwise propose publicly to withdraw, change, amend, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Teleflex, the board actions.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above and in the section entitled “—No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals,” at any
time prior to the time the requisite Vascular Solutions shareholder vote is obtained, our board may, in response to an intervening
event or a superior proposal, (x) make a change of recommendation and/or (y) terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into
a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a superior proposal. Our board is permitted to take these actions solely
if:

• our board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of our board under applicable law;

• we have given Teleflex at least four business days’ written notice (which notice period is erroneously referred to in various
provisions of the merger agreement as a five-business day period) advising Teleflex of its intention to take such action,
which notice will include (i) for intervening events, the reasons therefor (including the material facts and circumstances
related to the applicable intervening event) or (ii) for superior proposals, a copy of the superior proposal, a copy of any
proposed agreements for such superior proposal (including any financing commitments related thereto) or, in each case, if
not provided in writing to us, a written summary of the terms thereof;

• for superior proposals, we have given Teleflex an additional two-business day notice period in the event of any change or
amendment to the financial or other material terms and conditions of any superior proposal;

• during any such required notice period, we have negotiated with Teleflex in good faith (to the extent Teleflex wishes to
negotiate) to enable Teleflex to determine whether to propose revisions to the terms of the merger agreement or any other
agreement related to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

• we have considered in good faith any proposal by Teleflex to amend the terms of the merger agreement or any other
agreement related to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

• at the end of the required notice period, taking into account any changes to the merger agreement or any other agreement
related to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement proposed by Teleflex, if any, and (i) for intervening
events, after consultation with outside legal counsel, our board has determined in good faith that the failure to make such
change of recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law even if such changes
proposed by Teleflex were given effect, or (ii) for superior proposals, after consultation with outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, our board has determined in good faith that such competing proposal would continue to constitute a
superior proposal even if such changes proposed by Teleflex were given effect; and

• in the case of any termination of the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior
proposal, prior to or simultaneously with such termination, we pay the termination fee (as described in the section entitled
“—Termination Fee”).

Nothing contained in the merger agreement prohibits us or our board from (i) disclosing to our shareholders a position with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
(ii) making any disclosure to our shareholders if our board has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, subject to compliance
with the restrictions on a change of recommendation described above.

Vascular Solutions Shareholders’ Meeting

Subject to the relevant provisions of the merger agreement, including our board’s right to change its recommendation in favor
of the merger and our right to terminate the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior
proposal, as described in the section entitled “—Change in Board Recommendation,” we have agreed to (1) convene and hold the
special meeting as promptly as practicable following the mailing of this document and (2) use commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit from our shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of the merger and adoption of the merger agreement and secure any
other approval of our shareholders that is required by applicable law in connection with the merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) we will not change the date of, postpone or adjourn the special meeting without Teleflex’s prior written consent, and (ii) Teleflex
may cause us to postpone or adjourn the special meeting by prior written notice to us.

Employee Matters

The merger agreement provides for the following treatment with respect to those employees of Vascular Solutions and its
subsidiaries who continue to be employed by the surviving company or one of its subsidiaries after the effective time, whom we
refer to as “continuing employees”:

• Teleflex will, or will cause the surviving company to, assume, honor and fulfill all material Vascular Solutions benefit
plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of the merger agreement (excluding Vascular
Solutions stock plans and the ESPP);

• from the effective time through December 31, 2017, Teleflex will, or will cause the surviving company to, provide each
continuing employee with base salary (or wages) and annual cash bonus opportunities that, in each case, are no less
favorable than those provided by Vascular Solutions immediately prior to the effective time;

• from the effective time through December 31, 2017, Teleflex will, or will cause the surviving company to, provide each
continuing employee with employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based compensation) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided by Vascular Solutions immediately prior to the effective time;

• Teleflex will, or will cause the surviving company to, provide that periods of employment with Vascular Solutions will be
taken into account for all purposes under all employee benefit plans maintained by Teleflex or an affiliate of Teleflex for
the benefit of the continuing employees, including vacation or other paid-time-off plans or arrangements, 401(k), pension
or other retirement plans and any severance or health or welfare plans (other than for purposes of determining any accrued
benefit under any defined benefit pension plan or as would result in a duplication of benefits);

• Teleflex will, or will cause the surviving company to, (i) ensure that no eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work
requirements or pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions will apply with respect to the continuing employees under
the applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Teleflex or any affiliate of Teleflex (except to the extent applicable under
the Vascular Solutions benefit plans immediately prior to the effective time), (ii) waive any and all evidence of insurability
requirements with respect to such continuing employees to the extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not
applicable to the continuing employees under the Vascular Solutions benefit plans immediately prior to the effective time
and (iii) credit each continuing employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments paid by such
employee under the Vascular Solutions benefit plans prior to the closing date during the year in which the closing of the
merger occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied his or her deductible
and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any health benefit plan of Teleflex or an affiliate of
Teleflex for such year; and

• Teleflex or the surviving company will permit the continuing employees who are then actively employed to make rollover
contributions of eligible rollover distributions, including loans, in the form of cash, in an amount equal to the full account
balance (including loans) distributed to such continuing employees from the Vascular Solutions’ 401(k) plans to Teleflex’s
or the surviving company’s applicable 401(k) plan.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Indemnification and Insurance

For not less than six years from and after the effective time, the surviving company is required to (and Teleflex is required to
cause the surviving company to) indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors and officers of Vascular Solutions and
our subsidiaries (each referred to as an “indemnified party”) against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable
attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim suit, proceeding or investigation to
each indemnified party subject to such indemnified party agreeing to return any such funds which a court has determined in a final,
non-appealable judgment such indemnified party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in respect
of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of the merger agreement, the consummation of the merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time, in connection with such
persons serving as an officer or director of Vascular Solutions or any of our subsidiaries or serving at the request of Vascular
Solutions or any of our subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or agent of another person, to the fullest extent permitted by law
or provided pursuant to Vascular Solutions’ governing documents or the organizational documents of any Vascular Solutions
subsidiary or any other agreement, if any, in existence on the date of the merger agreement.

Teleflex and Merger Sub have also agreed that, for six years after the effective time, all rights to elimination or limitation of
liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time, now
existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in Vascular Solutions’ or our subsidiaries’ charter documents or any other
agreement will survive the merger and continue in full force and effect. The surviving company’s charter documents will not contain
any provisions contradictory or otherwise adverse to such rights or be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such indemnified party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the effective time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
the merger agreement, the consummation of the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement)
without the consent of such indemnified party.

Teleflex has also agreed to either (i) cause the surviving company to provide, for a period of not less than six years from the
effective time, a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy that is no less favorable than the Company’s existing policy as of
the date of the merger agreement or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage, with
an annual cost not in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of the merger agreement referred to as the
“D&O insurance,” covering acts or omissions at or prior to the effective time with respect to those persons who are covered by the
D&O insurance as of the effective time, or (ii) at Teleflex’s option, Vascular Solutions or surviving company may obtain, a single
premium tail coverage with respect to D&O insurance with an annual cost not in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid
prior to the date of the merger agreement.

Teleflex and the surviving company are required to make proper provision for the continuation of these rights in connection
with certain future corporate transactions.

Coordination on Litigation

The merger agreement requires Vascular Solutions and Teleflex to promptly notify (but in any event within 24 hours) the other
party of any litigation related the merger agreement, the merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement that is
brought or threatened by any shareholder of that party against such party, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective directors
or officers. Unless we have made a change of recommendation, we must give Teleflex the opportunity to participate, at Teleflex’s
expense, in the defense, prosecution or settlement of any such litigation, and we are not allowed to offer to settle, or agree to settle,
any such litigation except with Teleflex’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Financing Efforts

As described in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Financing of the Merger,” while Teleflex’s obligations under
the merger agreement are not subject to any financing condition, Teleflex has entered into a debt commitment letter. Teleflex will
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, the

proceeds of the debt financing on the terms and conditions described in the commitment letter, including using its reasonable best
efforts with respect to (i) maintaining in effect the commitment letter; (ii) negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the debt
financing consistent with the terms and conditions contained therein or, if available, on other terms that are acceptable to Teleflex in
its sole discretion and would not adversely affect (including with respect to timing, taking into account the expected timing of the
marketing period) the ability of Teleflex to consummate the transactions contemplated herein; and (iii) taking into account the
expected timing of the marketing period, satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Teleflex and its subsidiaries to
obtaining the debt financing that are within Teleflex’s control.

Teleflex will not, without our prior written consent, (i) terminate the commitment letter (unless the commitment letter is
replaced in a manner consistent with the following clause (ii)) or (ii) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
material provision or remedy under, or replace, the commitment letter if such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement (x)
would (1) add any new material conditions to the debt financing (or modify any existing condition in a manner adverse to Teleflex)
that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect (including with respect to timing, taking into account the expected timing of
the marketing period) the ability of Teleflex to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, or (2) taking
into account the expected timing of the marketing period, could be reasonably expected to make the timely funding of any of the
debt financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining any of the debt financing materially less likely to occur, (y) reduces the
aggregate amount of the debt financing to an amount such that the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement could not be

Termination

In general, the merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or
after approval of the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement by our shareholders, in the following ways:

prohibited by a final and non-appealable order, decree or ruling;

° the merger has not occurred on or before May 30, 2017, referred to as the “End Date;” or

° the requisite vote of our shareholders is not obtained at the special meeting;

provided, however, that these rights to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any party if a breach by such
party of any provision of the merger agreement will have been the primary cause of, or resulted in, such event; or

• by Teleflex, prior to the time our shareholders approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement, if:

° our board or any committee thereof has changed its recommendation in favor of approval of the merger agreement
and the merger to our shareholders;

Exchange Act that constitutes a competing proposal within ten business days after the commencement of such tender
offer or exchange offer;

merger to our shareholders within ten business days after a competing proposal has been publicly announced; or

° if we have breached or failed to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the merger
agreement such that the closing conditions would not be satisfied, and such breach or failure cannot be cured or, if
capable of being cured and we are continuing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure, has not been cured by
the earlier of the End Date or 30 days after written notice thereof has been given by Teleflex to Vascular Solutions; or

• by Vascular Solutions,

° at any time prior to the time the Vascular Solutions shareholder vote is obtained, in order to accept a superior
proposal in accordance with the no-shop restrictions, provided that Vascular Solutions pays the termination fee; or

° if Teleflex has breached any representation or warranty and such breach has had a “material adverse effect” or
Teleflex has failed to perform in any material respect a covenant or agreement set forth in the merger agreement such
that the closing conditions would not be satisfied, and such breach or failure cannot be cured or, if capable of being
cured and Teleflex is continuing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure, has not been cured by the earlier of
the End Date or 30 days after written notice thereof has been given by Vascular Solutions to Teleflex.

Termination Fee

Vascular Solutions will pay Teleflex a termination fee in an amount equal to $35 million if the merger agreement is terminated
in the following circumstances:

• if the merger agreement is terminated by Vascular Solutions in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a

and the merger to our shareholders;

announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a competing proposal, or a competing proposal has otherwise
become publicly known, and in each case such competing proposal has not been irrevocably withdrawn prior to the date of

Limitations on Remedies

The merger agreement provides that any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to the Agreement may
only be brought against persons that are expressly named as parties to the merger agreement, and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth therein. The merger agreement is specifically without recourse to former, current or future direct or
indirect equity holders, controlling persons, shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners and assignees of Vascular Solutions, Teleflex or Merger Sub and their respective affiliates or
representatives.

If the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the provisions described in the section entitled “—Termination,” the merger
agreement will become null and void and there will be no liability on the part of Vascular Solutions, Teleflex or Merger Sub, except
that (a) termination of the merger agreement will not relieve any party from liability for any fraud or willful breach of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreement set forth in the merger agreement and (b) the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement between the parties and the merger agreement relating to termination and general matters will survive termination.

Expenses

In general, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger and the merger agreement will be paid by the party
incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the merger is consummated. Teleflex is responsible for all filing fees associated
with the HSR Act and for any transfer taxes imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Amendment and Modification

The merger agreement may be amended at any time by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Vascular Solutions,
Teleflex and Merger Sub and authorized by the respective boards of directors of the parties, except that after the merger agreement
has been adopted by our shareholders, no amendment that requires further shareholder approval under applicable law will be made
without such further approval. At any time prior to the effective time, the parties may extend the time for performance of any
obligations, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the parties, and, subject to applicable law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions in the merger agreement. Any waiver must be set forth in a written instrument
signed by the applicable party.

ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION
(PROPOSAL 2)

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, we are providing our
shareholders with a separate advisory (non-binding) vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to
our named executive officers in connection with the merger, as described in the table entitled “Golden Parachute Compensation”
under “The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Vascular Solutions’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification
of Payments and Benefits to Vascular Solutions’ Executives,” including the footnotes to the table and related narrative discussion.

Our board unanimously recommends that our shareholders approve the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Vascular Solutions’ named executive officers
in connection with the merger, and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or
become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table in the section entitled
“The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of Vascular Solutions’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Quantification of Payments and Benefits to Vascular Solutions’ Executives,” including the footnotes to the table and the
related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”

The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on
the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger and adopt the
merger agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa.
Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on
either Vascular Solutions or Teleflex. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and the merger is completed, the
compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the applicable compensation agreements and
arrangements, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of our shareholders.

The above resolution approving the merger-related compensation of our named executive officers on an advisory basis requires
that more shares are voted “FOR” the proposal than “AGAINST.”

Our board unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Vascular Solutions vote “FOR” the named executive
officer merger-related compensation proposal.

VOTE ON ADJOURNMENT (PROPOSAL 3)

Our shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give our board authority to adjourn the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger
agreement, if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger and adopt
the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum. If this adjournment proposal is approved, the special meeting could be
adjourned by our board to any date. In addition, our board could postpone the special meeting before it commences. If the special
meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be
able to revoke them at any time before the final vote.

We do not anticipate calling a vote on this proposal if a quorum is present and the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the
merger agreement is approved by at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the record date.

The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to approve the merger and
adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the proposal to approve the merger and adopt the merger
agreement and vote not to approve the adjournment proposal and vice versa.

Approval of the adjournment proposal requires that more shares are voted “FOR” the proposal than “AGAINST.”

Our board unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Vascular Solutions vote “FOR” the adjournment
proposal, if a vote on such proposal is called.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of January
17, 2017 by each person, or group of affiliated persons, who is known by us to own beneficially more than 5% of our common
stock, each of our directors, each of our executive officers and all of our directors and executive officers as a group.

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially
owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock under options held by that person that are
currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of January 17, 2017 are considered outstanding. These shares, however, are not
considered outstanding when computing the percentage ownership of each other person. The number of shares subject to options
that each beneficial owner has the right to acquire within 60 days of January 17, 2017 is described in the footnotes to the table.

Except as indicated in the footnotes to this table, each shareholder named in the table has sole voting and investment power for
the shares shown as beneficially owned by them, and the shares beneficially owned by our directors and executive officers are not
subject to any pledge.

Percentage of ownership is based on 17,568,375 shares of our common stock outstanding on January 17, 2017.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS

The following is a summary of the material provisions of Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business
Corporation Act, copies of which are attached to this document as Annex C and which are incorporated by reference into this
document. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about these statutory
provisions that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business
Corporation Act in their entirety, as the rights and obligations of the Company and its shareholders are governed by the express
terms of these statutory provisions and other applicable law and not by this summary or any other information contained in this
document.

Section 302A.471 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act entitles any Vascular Solutions shareholder who is entitled to
vote and who objects to the merger to dissent from such action and obtain payment for the “fair value” of his or her shares of our
common stock. Any Vascular Solutions shareholder contemplating an attempt to assert and exercise dissenters’ rights in connection
with the merger should review carefully the provisions of Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business Corporation
Act (copies of which are attached to this document as Annex C), particularly the specific procedural steps required to perfect such
rights. Dissenters’ rights are lost if the procedural requirements of Section 302A.473 are not fully and precisely satisfied.

Under Section 302A.473, subdivision 3, a shareholder who wishes to exercise dissenters’ rights, which we refer to as a
dissenter, must file with us (at Vascular Solutions, Inc., Attn: Secretary, 6464 Sycamore Court North, Minneapolis, Minnesota
55369), before the shareholder vote on the merger, a written notice of intent to demand the “fair value” of the shares of our common
stock owned by the shareholder. Under Section 302A.471, subdivision 2, beneficial owners of shares who desire to exercise
statutory dissenters’ rights must obtain and submit the registered owner’s written consent at or before the time the notice of intent to
demand fair value is due. In addition, the shareholder must not vote his or her shares in favor of the merger. A vote against the
merger does not in itself constitute such a written notice, and a failure to vote does not affect the validity of a timely written notice.
However, the submission of a properly signed blank proxy will constitute a vote in favor of approving the merger and a waiver of
statutory dissenters’ rights.

If the merger is approved by our shareholders, then we must send to all dissenters who filed the necessary notice of intent to
demand the fair value of their shares (and who did not vote their shares in favor of the merger) a notice containing certain
information required by Section 302A.473, subdivision 4, including the address to which a dissenter must send a demand for
payment and certificates representing shares in order to obtain payment for such shares and the date by which they must be received.
In order to receive the fair value of the shares under Section 302A.473, a dissenter must demand payment and deposit certificates
representing shares within 30 days after we give such notice. Under Minnesota law, notice by mail is given when deposited in the
United States mail. A shareholder who fails to timely make demand for payment and to deposit certificates as required by
Section 302A.473, subdivision 4, loses the right to receive the fair value of his or her shares under such section
notwithstanding the timely filing of notice of intent to demand payment under Section 302A.473, subdivision 3.

Except as provided below, if demand for payment and deposit of stock certificates is duly made by a dissenter as required by
the notice, then after our receipt of such demand or the effective date of the merger, whichever is later, we must pay the dissenter an
amount which we estimate to be the fair value of the dissenter’s shares of our common stock, with interest, if any. For the purpose of
a dissenter’s appraisal rights under Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473, “fair value” means the value of the shares of stock
immediately before the effective date of the merger. It is possible that the fair value of shares our common stock as determined
pursuant to dissenters' rights procedures may be determined to be less than the value of the merger consideration.
Additionally, “interest” means interest commencing five days after the effective date of such merger until the date of payment,
calculated at the rate provided in Minnesota Statutes Section 549.09 Subd. 1, Paragraph (c), clause (1), which is currently 4.0% per
year. If a dissenter believes this payment is less than the fair value of the shares of our common stock, with interest, if any, such
dissenter must give written notice to us of his or her own estimate of the fair value of the shares of stock, with interest, if any, within
30 days after the date we mail the payment, and must demand payment of the difference between his or her estimate and our
payment. If such dissenter fails to give written notice of such estimate to us, or fails to demand payment of the difference, within the
30-day time period, such dissenter is entitled only to the amount of our payment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

We may withhold such payment with respect to shares of our common stock for which a dissenter demanding payment (or
persons on whose behalf such dissenter acts) was not the beneficial owner as of the first public announcement date of the merger,
which is December 2, 2016. As to each such dissenter who has validly demanded payment, following the effective date of such
merger or the receipt of demand, whichever is later, we must mail our estimate of the fair value of such dissenter’s shares of stock
and offer to pay this amount with interest, if any, to the dissenter upon receipt of such dissenter’s agreement to accept this amount in
full satisfaction. If such dissenter believes that our offer is for less than the fair value of the shares of stock, with interest, if any,
such dissenter must give written notice to us of his or her own estimate of the fair value of the shares of stock, with interest, if any,
and demand payment of this amount. This demand must be mailed to us within 30 days after the mailing of our offer. If the dissenter
fails to make this demand within the 30-day time period, such dissenter is entitled only to the amount we offered.

If we and a dissenter (including both a dissenter who held shares of our common stock on or prior to December 2, 2016, which
was the date the merger was first publicly announced, and a dissenter who purchased shares of our common stock after such date
who have complied with their respective demand requirements) do not settle the dissenter’s demand within 60 days after we receive
the dissenter’s estimate of the fair value of his or her shares of stock, then we must file a petition in a court of competent jurisdiction
in the county in which our registered office is located, requesting that the court determine the statutory fair value of stock with
interest, if any. Our registered office is currently located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, but is subject to change at any time. All
dissenters whose demands are not settled within the applicable 60-day settlement period must be made parties to this proceeding.

The court will then determine whether each dissenter in question has fully complied with the provisions of Section 302A.473,
and for all dissenters who have fully complied and not forfeited statutory dissenters’ rights, will determine the fair value of the
shares, taking into account any and all factors the court finds relevant (including, without limitation, the recommendation of any
appraisers which may have been appointed by the court), computed by any method that the court, in its discretion, sees fit to use,
whether or not used by us or a dissenter. The fair value of the shares as determined by the court is binding on all dissenters.
However, under the statute, dissenters are not liable to us for the amount, if any, by which payments remitted to the dissenters
exceed the fair value of such shares determined by a court, with interest. The costs and expenses of such a court proceeding are
assessed against us, except that the court may assess part or all of those costs and expenses against a dissenter whose action in
demanding payment is found to be arbitrary, vexatious or not in good faith.

Under Section 302A.471, subdivision 2, a shareholder may not assert dissenters’ rights with respect to less than all of the
shares of our common stock registered in such shareholder’s name, unless the shareholder dissents with respect to all shares
beneficially owned by another person and discloses the name and address of such other person.

Under Section 302A.471, subdivision 4, a shareholder has no right at law or in equity to have the merger agreement set aside or
rescinded, except if approval or consummation of such merger agreement is fraudulent with respect to such shareholder or us.

In view of the complexity of Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, the Company’s
shareholders who may wish to pursue dissenters’ rights should consult their legal and financial advisors.

FUTURE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

Depending on if and when the merger is completed, we may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2017. If the merger
is completed, we will not hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2018. If the merger is not completed, you will continue to be
entitled to attend and participate in our annual meetings of shareholders. If any such annual meeting is held, shareholder proposals
will be eligible for consideration for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy for such annual meeting of shareholders in
accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and our bylaws.

The date for shareholder proposals intended for inclusion in our 2017 proxy materials for presentation at the annual meeting of
shareholders, if we hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2017, was November 25, 2016. If the date of the 2017 annual meeting
of shareholders is moved more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, the
deadline for inclusion of proposals in our proxy statement is instead a reasonable time before we begin to print and mail our proxy
materials.

We must receive notice of any other shareholder proposals, including proposals for director nominees, intended to be presented
at our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, but not proposed for inclusion in our proxy material, in writing and delivered to our
principal executive office no later than February 8, 2017. If the date of the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders is moved more than
30 days before or after such anniversary date of the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, notice by a shareholder will be timely
only if so delivered or so mailed and received not less than 90 days before the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders or, if later,
within ten days after the first public announcement of the date of 2017 annual meeting of shareholders.

Sub and the Company and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Articles of Merger to be delivered to the

(iv)   each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub then issued and outstanding shall
be converted into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)   At the Effective Time, all Shares converted pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(iii) shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any certificates evidencing such Shares (the “Certificates”) or
non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor.

Section 2.5   Surrender of Certificates.

(a)   Prior to the Closing, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled
pursuant to this Agreement. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent sufficient funds
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares (other than Shares cancelled or converted pursuant to
Sections 2.4(a)(i) and 2.4(a)(ii) and Dissenting Shares) (the “Payment Fund”). With respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall
only be required to deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares if the holder thereof fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its
right to dissent under the MBCA. To the extent the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to make
prompt payment of the amounts described in the preceding sentence, Parent and Merger Sub shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is maintained at a level sufficient to
make such payments. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, that (i) no
such investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments required by this Article II or affect the amount of
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to
the Paying Agent in the amount of any such losses and (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay
payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any and all interest or other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall be
paid to Parent or its designee. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection
with the exchange of Shares and the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares.

(b)   Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each Person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive any Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(iii) (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon
(A) surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, or
(B) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall then be cancelled. No interest
shall accrue or be paid on the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing Shares are registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the applicable Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,

or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.
Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(c)   At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Law) as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for the applicable Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered or transferred prior to the
date on which the applicable Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, then any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(d)   No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date
on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(e)   At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with respect
to Shares shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for surrender or transfer, as
applicable, it shall be cancelled and, subject to compliance with this Section 2.5, exchanged for the cash amount in immediately
available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.5.

(f)   If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an effective affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, which includes an agreement to indemnify and defend and hold
harmless Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent from and against any and all costs, claims, losses, judgments,
damages, counsel fees, expenses and liabilities whatsoever which each may suffer, sustain or incur in connection with (i) the
inaccuracy of any statement or the breach of any representation or warranty set forth in such affidavit, and (ii) any payment for or
transfer, exchange or delivery of such Certificate and such Person’s inability to locate such Certificate, and, if required by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.8) equal to
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

Section 2.6   Dissenters’ Rights.

(a)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held of record or beneficially by a Person who has not voted in favor of approval of the Merger and adoption of
the Plan of Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly demands dissenter’s rights with respect to such Shares (“Dissenting
Shares”) pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (the “Dissenters’
Rights”), shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such Dissenting Shares but
instead shall be entitled only to payment of the fair value (including interest determined in accordance with Section 302A.473 of the
MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Dissenters’ Rights; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to dissent under (or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to receive fair value pursuant to) the

Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely
for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration, upon surrender of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 2.5, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.

(b)   The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company for Dissenters’ Rights with respect
to any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(c)   If the Surviving Corporation makes any payment with respect to the Dissenting Shares to the holders thereof
pursuant to the Dissenters’ Rights, then any portion of the Merger Consideration relating to such Dissenting Shares held in the
Payment Fund shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation upon demand.

Section 2.7   Treatment of Company Options; Restricted Shares; Stock Plans.

(a)   Treatment of Options. At the Effective Time, each option or similar right to purchase Shares (other than pursuant
to the ESPP) (the “Company Options”), granted under any stock option plan of the Company, including the Vascular Solutions, Inc.
Stock Option and Stock Award Plan, as amended from time to time, or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (collectively, the
“Company Stock Plans”), whether or not such Company Options are then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of the Company Option or any other Person,
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, as soon as practicable (but in no event after the
first payroll date following the Closing Date) following the Effective Time an amount in cash (subject to deduction for any Taxes
required to be withheld in accordance with Section 2.8), without interest, equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share subject to such Company Option. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company
Board, or a duly authorized committee thereof, shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all necessary and appropriate action,
including under the Company Stock Plans and the stock option agreements evidencing the Company Options and, to the extent
necessary, obtaining consent of the holders of the Company Options, to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.7(a).

receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.4(a)(iii). As soon as practicable (but in no event after the first payroll
date following the Closing Date) following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each holder of Restricted
Shares an amount in cash (subject to deduction for any Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 2.8), without
interest, equal to the product of (A) the total number of Restricted Shares held by such holder of Restricted Shares and (B) the
Merger Consideration. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company Board, or a duly authorized committee
thereof, shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all necessary and appropriate action, including under the Company Stock Plans
and the restricted stock award agreements evidencing the Restricted Shares and, to the extent necessary, obtaining consent of the
holders of the Restricted Shares, to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.7(b).

(c)   Termination of Company Stock Plans. After the Effective Time, all Company Stock Plans shall be terminated
and no further Company Options, Restricted Shares or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.

for the then-outstanding offering periods using such date as the final purchase date for each such offering period, and (v) assuming
the occurrence of the Effective Time, the ESPP shall terminate immediately following such purchases of Shares. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that it will timely comply with any written notice requirements set forth in the ESPP, including the written
notice requirement set forth in Section 19(b) of the ESPP. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to

Agreement, any amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such consideration under any applicable
provisions of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law (including without limitation the Code). To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 4.5   Sufficiency of Funds; Solvency.

(a)   Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of an executed debt financing
commitment letter in effect as of the date hereof, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto, and each fee
letter associated therewith (collectively, the “Fee Letter,” and together with such debt financing commitment letter, the “Debt
Commitment Letter”) (it being understood that the Fee Letter may be customarily redacted; provided, however, that no provisions
that, or that could reasonably be expected to, adversely affect the availability of or impose additional conditions on, the availability
of the Debt Financing at the Effective Time may be redacted) from the Lenders pursuant to which such Lenders have committed to
provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of financing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and related fees and expenses and the refinancing of certain outstanding indebtedness
of Parent (the “Debt Financing”). There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts, understandings or arrangements that could
affect the availability of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter
delivered to the Company pursuant to this Section 4.5(a).

(b)   As of the date of this Agreement: (i) the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger
Sub, each of the other parties thereto; (ii) the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any respect and no
such amendment or modification is contemplated or pending (other than amendments or modifications to the Debt Commitment
Letter solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities); and (iii) the commitments
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated, reduced or rescinded in any respect and no such
withdrawal, termination, reduction or rescission is contemplated by Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger
Sub, any of the other parties thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has paid in full any and all fees (including
commitment fees and other fees) required to be paid under the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to the date of
this Agreement, and Parent is unaware of any fact or occurrence existing on the date of this Agreement that could reasonably be
expected to make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate or that could
reasonably be expected to cause the Debt Commitment Letter to be ineffective. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies (including pursuant to any “flex” provisions in the Fee Letter or otherwise) related to
the funding of the full amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing except as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

(c)   As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
could reasonably be expected to constitute a failure to satisfy a condition precedent by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other party thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter. As of
the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
any of the conditions that are required to be satisfied by it as a condition to the obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter prior
to the expiration thereof, or that the full amount of the Debt Financing will not be available in full to Parent and Merger Sub at the
Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, nor does Parent or Merger Sub have knowledge or reason to believe that any of the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter will not perform their respective obligations thereunder.

(d)   Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 and that the Debt Financing
is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter together
with any cash on the balance sheet of Parent, will, in the aggregate, constitute the funds necessary to consummate the Merger and
the other Transactions, including payment in cash

Section 5.2   No Solicitation.

(a)   During the Pre-Closing Period, except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Section 5.2, the Company
agrees that it shall not (and that the Company shall cause each Company Subsidiary and the directors and officers of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries not to), and that it shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its other Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the submission or an announcement of any Company
Competing Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic information relating to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with any Company Competing Proposal or any proposal or offer that
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Competing Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions with any Person
with respect to any Company Competing Proposal or any proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Company Competing Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend, propose publicly to approve or recommend, or fail to timely
recommend against, any Company Competing Proposal, (v) withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or otherwise propose
publicly to withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, or
(vi) enter into any letter of intent or other document or agreement relating to, or any agreement or commitment providing for, any
Company Competing Proposal (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement” and any act described in clauses (iv) and (v) above, a
“Company Change of Recommendation”). The Company shall immediately cease, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Representatives to immediately cease, any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Company Competing Proposal. The Company shall promptly following the execution of this
Agreement inform its Representatives of the Company’s obligations under this Section 5.2. For purposes of this Section 5.2, the
term “Person” includes any Person or “group,” as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the
Company, Parent. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the Company’s Representatives may in any event (A) seek to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any bona fide, written Company Competing Proposal (or amended proposal) that
did not result from a material breach of Section 5.2(a) solely to determine whether such Company Competing Proposal constitutes
or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal and (B) inform a Person that has made a Company
Competing Proposal of the provisions of this Section 5.2, in each case, so long as the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the
Company’s Representatives otherwise comply with this Section 5.2 in connection therewith. The Company shall not terminate,
waive, amend or modify any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which the Company is a party, in each case,
with respect to the submission of any Company Competing Proposal, except to the extent to allow the applicable party to make a
confidential Company Competing Proposal to the Company Board.

(b)   Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.2(a), if the Company receives, prior to the time the
Required Company Shareholder Vote is obtained, a bona fide, written Company Competing Proposal from any Person that did not
result from a material breach of Section 5.2(a), which the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with the
Company’s outside legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or (ii) could reasonably be expected to
result, after the taking of any of the actions referred to in either of clause (x) or (y) below, in a Company Superior Proposal, then in
either event, with respect to such Company Competing Proposal or Person, prior to the time the Required Company Shareholder
Vote is obtained, the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making such
Company Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from such Person an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and any such nonpublic information has previously been provided to Parent or its
Representatives or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such information or data is provided to
such Person and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect to the Company Competing Proposal.

(c)   The Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing promptly (but in any event within two (2) days) (i) after
receipt of any Company Competing Proposal (or any proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Competing Proposal), which notice shall include the identity of the Person making such proposal or offer and copies of all
proposals, offers and drafts of proposed agreements related thereto, (ii) of any change to the financial or other material terms and
conditions of any Company Competing Proposal and the Company shall otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of
any such Company Competing Proposal (including by providing copies of all proposals, offers and drafts of proposed agreements
related thereto that have not already been provided pursuant to clause (i) above) and (iii) after receipt

of any request for non-public information relating to it or any Company Subsidiary or for access to its or any of the Company
Subsidiaries’ properties, books or records by any Person in connection with a Company Competing Proposal or a proposal or offer
that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Competing Proposal. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement that would prohibit it from providing such
information to Parent.

(d)   Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.2 to the contrary, at any time prior to the time the Required Company
Shareholder Vote is obtained, the Company Board may make a Company Change of Recommendation (i) in response to a Company
Intervening Event, or (ii) a Company Superior Proposal, in each case, if and only if, with respect to each of clauses (i) and (ii), the
Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board under applicable Minnesota Law
and the Company first complies with Section 5.2(e).

(e)   Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under Section 5.2(d)(i), the Company shall provide Parent
with four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to effect a Company Change of Recommendation
and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor (including the material facts and circumstances related to the applicable
Company Intervening Event), and during such four (4) Business Day period, (x) the Company shall negotiate, and cause its
Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable
Parent to determine whether to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would obviate the need for the
Company Board to make a Company Change of Recommendation, (y) the Company shall consider in good faith any proposal by
Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation and (z) at the end of the four (4) Business Day period described above, and taking into account any changes to
this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company, the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with the
Company’s outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members
of the Company Board under applicable Minnesota Law even if such changes proposed by Parent were given effect or (ii) under
Section 5.2(d)(ii), the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) Business Days’ prior written notice (it being understood and
agreed that any change or amendment to the financial or other material terms and conditions of any Company Competing Proposal
shall require the Company to again comply with this Section 5.2(e) and provide a new notice and an additional two (2) Business
Day period) advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and contemporaneously providing to Parent a copy
of the Company Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed agreements for such Company Superior Proposal (including any
financing commitments related thereto) (or, in each case, if not provided in writing to the Company or any of its Representatives, a
written summary of the terms thereof), and during such five (5) Business Day period (or any subsequent two (2) Business Day
period), (x) the Company shall negotiate, and cause its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent and its Representatives in good
faith (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to determine whether to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement or any other agreement related to the Transactions such that such Company Competing Proposal would no longer
constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (y) the Company shall consider in good faith any proposal by Parent to amend the terms
and conditions of this Agreement or any other agreement related to the Transactions such that such Company Competing Proposal
would no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal and (z) at the end of such five (5) Business Day period, and taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company, the Company Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Competing Proposal
would continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal even if such changes proposed by Parent were given effect.

(f)   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) disclosing to
the Company’s shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Company Board has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with the
Company’s outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the
Company Board under applicable Minnesota Law; provided, however, that this Section 5.2(f) shall not permit the Company Board
to make a Company Change of Recommendation except in compliance with Section 5.2(d) and Section 5.2(e).

impediments or lessening of competition or creation or strengthening of a dominant position through merger or acquisition, and
shall promptly make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary.

(c)   If Parent or the Company (or any of their respective affiliates) receives a request for additional information from
any Governmental Entity that is related to the Transactions, then such Party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be
made, and after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response to such request. No Party shall participate in any meeting
or engage in any material substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions without giving the
other Party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to
attend or participate. Parent shall advise the Company promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written)
which Parent proposes to make or enter into with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with
respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law as promptly as practicable.

(d)   Parent shall take, and shall cause its affiliates to take (and, with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
and its Subsidiaries and affiliates shall be permitted to take, without affecting any representation, warranty, covenant or condition in
this Agreement), all action necessary to avoid the entry or to effect the dissolution of, or vacate or lift, any judgment or order that
would otherwise have the effect of preventing, impairing or delaying the Closing; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall
require (or be deemed to require) Parent or any of its affiliates to agree to or take any action with respect to the matters set forth in
this Section 6.3 that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (x) the
financial condition or result of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) the anticipated
economic benefit or value that Parent reasonably expects to be realized from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, Parent and its affiliates shall not be required (and Parent shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries
to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to), take any action with respect to any order or any applicable Law
which is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

Section 6.4   Publicity. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective
affiliates or Representatives, shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
the Merger or this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, unless such Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law
or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions,
in which event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the
other Party to review and comment upon such press release or other announcement as far in advance as practicable and shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; provided, however, that without limiting any
of its obligations under Section 5.2, the Company shall not be required by this Section 6.4 to provide any such review or comment
to Parent in connection with the receipt and existence of a Company Competing Proposal or a Company Change of
Recommendation and matters

not inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance
with this Section 6.4 (so long as such disclosure is still accurate).

Section 6.5   Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance and Indemnification. For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors and officers of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including
advancing reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law; provided, however, that such
Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer or director of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another Person, to the fullest extent permitted by Law or provided pursuant to the Company
Governing Documents or the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any other agreement, if any, in existence on
the date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that for six (6) years after the Effective Time all rights to elimination or limitation of
liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties
as provided in the Company Governing Documents or the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any other
agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide to the Indemnified Parties the same rights as provided to the Indemnified Parties on the date of
this Agreement under the provisions in the Company Governing Documents and the organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary, in each case, regarding elimination or limitation of liability, indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents
or other fiduciaries and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement, and the Surviving
Corporation’s organizational documents shall not contain any provisions contradictory or otherwise adverse to such rights or be
amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
Transactions) without the consent of such Indemnified Party. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Company’s current directors and officers an insurance
and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the “D&O Insurance”) that is no
less favorable than the Company’s existing policy as of the date of this Agreement or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable
is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement or, if less, the cost of a policy providing coverage on the same terms as the Company’s existing policy as of the date of
this Agreement; provided, further, that, at Parent’s option, in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company or Surviving
Corporation may at or prior to the Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to D&O Insurance
with an annual cost not in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.5 to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this
Section 6.5, the provisions of this Section 6.5 that require the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and advance expenses shall
continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings
relating thereto. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that the

successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.5. The rights and obligations under this Section 6.5 shall survive consummation of the Merger and, following the Effective
Time, shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party without the written consent of such
Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section 6.5 are intended to be, following the Effective Time, for the benefit of, and shall
be Enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

Section 6.6   Takeover Statutes. The Parties shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts to (a)
take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute or, in the case of the Company, any similar provision of the Company
Governing Documents, is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute
or, in the case of the Company, any similar provision of the Company Governing Documents, is or becomes applicable to any of the
foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute
on the Merger and the other Transactions.

Section 6.7   Obligations of Merger Sub. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause each of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement
and to cause Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

Section 6.8   Employee Benefits Matters.

(a)   Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume, honor and fulfill all material Company Benefit
Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Company Stock Plans and ESPP). Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof (the “Continuing Employees”), from the Effective Time through December 31,
2017 (i)(x) base salary (or wages) and (y) annual cash bonus opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than those
provided by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based
compensation) that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to those provided by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, that periods of employment with the Company (including any current or former affiliate of the Company or any
predecessor of the Company to the extent recognized by the Company) shall be taken into account for all purposes under all
employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or an affiliate of Parent for the benefit of the Continuing Employees, including
vacation or other paid-time-off plans or arrangements, 401(k), pension or other retirement plans and any severance or health or
welfare plans (other than for purposes of determining any accrued benefit under any defined benefit pension plan or as would result
in a duplication of benefits).

(b)   Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i)
ensure that no eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions shall
apply with respect to the Continuing Employees under the applicable health and welfare benefits plan of Parent or any affiliate of
Parent (except to the extent applicable under Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time), (ii) waive any and all
evidence of insurability requirements with respect to such Continuing Employees to the extent such evidence of insurability
requirements were not applicable to the Continuing Employees under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (iii) credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments paid by such
employee under the Company Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of
determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-
pocket maximum under any health benefit plan of Parent or an affiliate of Parent for such year. The Merger shall not affect any
Continuing Employee’s accrual of, or right to use, in accordance with Company policy as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, any personal, sick, vacation or other paid-time-off accrued but unused by such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

action as is necessary to terminate any 401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
“Company 401(k) Plans”), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such resolutions and any documents prepared in connection with such corporate actions prior
to the adoption of such resolutions or taking of such actions. Following the Effective Time and as soon as practicable following the
termination of the Company 401(k) Plans, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants. Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions of “eligible
rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), including loans, in the form of cash, in an amount
equal to the full account balance (including loans) distributed to such Continuing Employees from the Company 401(k) Plans to
Parent’s or the Surviving Corporation’s applicable 401(k) plan.

(d)   Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or
service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the
services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly
provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any affiliate of Parent and
the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other applicable plan or program covering such Continuing Employee.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.8 shall (i) be deemed or construed to be
an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Merger Sub, (ii) create any third
party rights in any Person or (iii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective affiliates to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event), (ii) the “base amount” (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such disqualified individual and (iii) underlying documentation on which such
calculations are based. Such information shall be updated and delivered to Parent not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date.

(f)   The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any material written communications intended for broad-based
and general distribution to any current or former employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries if such
communications relate to any of the Transactions, and, to the extent practicable, shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such communications prior to distribution.

twenty-four (24) hours) of any litigation brought or threatened by any shareholder of that Party against such Party, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the Transactions. Unless,
in the case of such litigation with respect to the Company, the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) has made a
Company Change of Recommendation, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate (at Parent’s expense) in the
defense, prosecution or settlement of any such litigation, and the Company shall not offer to settle any such litigation, nor shall any
such settlement be agreed to without Parent’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. In the event of, and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this Section 6.9 and Section 5.1
or Section 6.3, the provisions of this Section 6.9 shall control.

Debt Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of

maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing
consistent with the terms and conditions contained therein or, if available, on other terms that are acceptable to Parent in its sole
discretion and would not adversely affect (including with respect to timing, taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period) the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, and (iii) taking into account the

any existing condition in a manner adverse to Parent) that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect (including with respect
to timing, taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (2) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, could be reasonably
expected to make the timely funding of any of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining any of the Debt
Financing materially less likely to occur, (y) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount such that the
transactions contemplated hereby could not be consummated or (z) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period,
could reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and

therefor and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event and in
any event no later than the last day of the Marketing Period, alternative financing (in an amount sufficient to enable the Transactions
to be consummated) from the same or other sources.

(d)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.13
shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent to (i) pay any fees
to the Lenders in excess of those contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and related fee letters as of the date hereof, whether
to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise or (ii) amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or
under the Debt Commitment Letter.

Adverse Effect (it being understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties, (A) all

set forth in Section 7.1 or, with respect to Parent or Merger Sub, in Section 7.2, or, with respect to the Company, in Section 7.3, to

(f)   at any time prior to the Effective Time, by Parent, by written notice to the Company, if a breach of any
representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company
has occurred that would cause a failure of the conditions in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) to be satisfied; provided, however, that, for
purposes of this Section 8.1(f), if such a breach is curable by the Company by the earlier of the End Date and thirty (30) days
following the date on which Parent gives the Company notice of such breach and the Company is continuing to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(f) on account of such
breach unless such breach remains uncured upon the earlier of the End Date and the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period;

(g)   at any time prior to the Effective Time, by the Company, by written notice to Parent, if (i) a breach of any
representation or warranty on the part of Parent has had a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) a failure to perform in any material

purposes of this Section 8.1(g), if such a breach is curable by Parent by the earlier of the End Date and thirty (30) days following the
date on which the Company gives Parent notice of such breach and Parent is continuing to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cure such breach, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(g) on account of such breach unless
such breach remains uncured upon the earlier of the End Date and the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period; or

(h)   by either the Company or Parent, by written notice to the other, if the Required Company Shareholder Vote shall
not have been obtained upon a vote taken thereon at the Company Shareholders Meeting, including any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

Section 8.2   Effect of Termination.

(a)   In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, the written notice thereof shall be
given by the terminating Party to the other Party or Parties shall specify the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive such termination; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud or a Willful Breach of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.

(b)   Termination Fee.

(i)   If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or the Company terminates this Agreement

termination by the Company and in the case of a termination by this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c), within two (2)
Business Days after such termination.

(ii)   If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(h) or if
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), (B) a Company Competing Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed
(or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Company Competing Proposal, or
a Company Competing Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly known) and in each case such Company Competing Proposal
(or such public announcement of an intention to make a Company Competing Proposal) has not been irrevocably withdrawn prior to
the date of termination, and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination (1) the Company consummates any Company
Competing Proposal or (2) the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for any Company Competing Proposal, then
the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days after the earlier of entering
into any definitive agreement providing for a Company Competing Proposal or consummation of any Company Competing
Proposal.

(iii)   In the event any amount is payable pursuant to this Section 8.2(b), such amount shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

(iv)   For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on

(c)   Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the
Transactions and that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that shall compensate Parent and
Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such payment is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1   Amendment and Modification; Waiver.

(a)   Subject to applicable Law, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, this
Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented, by written agreement of each Party (as approved by action taken by its
board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof); provided, however, that after any adoption of the Plan of Merger by the
holders of Shares, no amendment that requires further shareholder approval under applicable Law after shareholder approval hereof
shall be made without such required further approval; provided, further, that no amendment to Sections 9.1(a), 9.7(b), 9.9, 9.10 and
9.13, in each case to the extent such amendment would affect the rights of a Lender (or any Lender Related Party relating to such
Lender) shall be effective as to such Lender without such Lender’s consent. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

(b)   At any time prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Parties may, by action
taken or authorized by each Party’s board of directors, or a duly authorized committee thereof, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other Parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other Parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) subject to applicable Law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other Parties contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to
any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf
of such Party. No failure or delay of any Party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right
or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The
rights and remedies of the Parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would
otherwise have hereunder.

Section 9.2   Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or
in any schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This Section
9.2 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Effective Time, they shall not be permitted to make, and no Party shall
have any liability or obligation with respect to, any claims for any breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein or any
covenant or agreement herein that is to have been performed by another Party on or prior to the Closing.

Section 9.3   Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such Expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.
Parent shall bear and timely pay (i) all filing fees associated with the HSR Act and (ii) all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes imposed with respect to the Transaction (other than any such Taxes required solely by reason of
a request by a holder of Shares that payment of the Merger Consideration be made to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Shares).

import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement,
unless the context requires otherwise. The term “or” has the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase “and/or.” The definitions

the electronic data room used in connection with this Agreement. The listing of any matter on the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is required
to be disclosed by the Company under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth
in this Agreement. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation by the Company
of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand the
scope of the Company’s representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement.

Section 9.6   Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be considered
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by each of the Parties and

Section 9.7   Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries.

(a)   This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements

Agreement, the Indemnified Parties shall have the right, following the Effective Time, to enforce the provisions of Section 6.5 and
the Lender Related Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries and have the right to enforce the provisions of Sections 9.1(a), 9.7(b),
9.9, 9.10, 9.13 (in each case, to the extent that any such Sections relate to the Lender Related Parties). The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with Section 9.1 without

rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect
so long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger are not affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.11   Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties, except Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion and without
the consent of any other Party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) Parent and one (1) or
more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii) one (1) or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of
Parent; provided, however, that no such assignment shall be permitted without the prior written consent of the other Parties if such
assignment could increase the risk that any of the conditions set forth in Article VII may not be timely satisfied, result in a breach of
any of covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement or adversely affect the Company; provided, further, however, that no
such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any obligation or liability under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, but without relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of

shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and
the exercise by a Party of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

(b)   Each Party to this Agreement agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by another Party of
any covenant, obligation or other provision set forth in this Agreement (i) such Party shall be entitled, without any proof of actual
damages (and in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it) to (A) a decree or order of specific performance or
mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant, obligation or other provision, and (B) an injunction
restraining such breach or threatened breach, and (ii) such Party shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such decree, order or injunction or in connection with any related action or Legal Proceeding.

(c)   The Parties’ rights in this Section 9.12 are an integral part of the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any
objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 9.12 (including any objection on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at
Law or that an award of such remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of doubt,
each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party.

Section 9.13   Non-Recourse. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement may only be

place, but instead solely by means of remote communication.

Section 1.02   Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the shareholders may be held on an annual or other less frequent basis as

may demand a regular meeting of shareholders by written demand given to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of
the Corporation. At each regular meeting the shareholders shall elect qualified successors for directors who serve for an indefinite

combination, including any action to change or otherwise affect the composition of the Board for that purpose, must be called by
shareholders holding not less than 25 percent of the voting power of all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote), who shall
demand such special meeting by written notice given to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the
Corporation specifying the purposes of such meeting.

Section 1.04   Meetings Held Upon Shareholder Demand. Within 30 days after receipt of a demand by the Chief Executive

the duty of the Board of Directors of the Corporation to cause a special or regular meeting of shareholders, as the case may be, to be
duly called and held on notice no later than 90 days after receipt of such demand. If the Board fails to cause such a meeting to be
called and held as required by this Section, the shareholder or shareholders making the demand may call the meeting by giving
notice as provided in Section 1.06 hereof at the expense of the Corporation.

Section 1.05   Adjournments. Any meeting of the shareholders may be adjourned from time to time to another date, time and

meeting will be reconvened are announced at the time of adjournment.

Section 1.06   Notice of Meetings. Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of each meeting of the shareholders, stating

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Section 1.07   Waiver of Notice. A shareholder may waive notice of the date, time, place, or purpose of a meeting of
shareholders. A waiver of notice by a shareholder entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at, or after the meeting, and
whether given in writing, orally, by authenticated electronic communication, or by attendance. Attendance by a shareholder at a
meeting is a waiver of notice of that meeting, unless the shareholder objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened, or objects before a vote on an item of business because the item
may not lawfully be considered at that meeting and does not participate in the consideration of the item at that meeting.

Section 1.08   Voting Rights. Subdivision 1. A shareholder shall have one vote for each share held which is entitled to vote.
Except as otherwise required by law, a holder of shares entitled to vote may vote any portion of the shares in any way the
shareholder chooses. If a shareholder votes without designating the proportion or number of shares voted in a particular way, the
shareholder is deemed to have voted all of the shares in that way.

Subdivision 2. The Board of Directors may fix, or authorize an officer to fix, a date not more than 60 days before the date of a
meeting of shareholders as the date for the determination of the holders of shares entitled to notice of and entitled to vote at the
meeting. When a date is so fixed, only shareholders on that date are entitled to notice of and permitted to vote at that meeting of
shareholders.

Section 1.09   Proxies. A shareholder may cast or authorize the casting of a vote by (a) filing a written appointment of a proxy,
signed by the shareholder, with an officer of the Corporation at or before the meeting at which the appointment is to be effective, or
(b) by telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication, whether or not accompanied by written instructions of
the shareholder, of an appointment of a proxy with the Corporation or the Corporation’s duly authorized agent at or before the
meeting at which the appointment is to be effective. The telephonic transmission or authenticated electronic communication must
set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the appointment was authorized by the shareholder.
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reproduction of the original of either the writing or transmission may be used in
lieu of the original, provided that it is a complete and legible reproduction of the entire original.

Section 1.10   Quorum. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a shareholders meeting
are a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held meeting is convened, the
shareholders present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a number of the
shareholders originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum.

Section 1.11   Acts of Shareholders. Subdivision 1. Except as otherwise required by law or specified in the Articles of
Incorporation of the Corporation, the shareholders shall take action by the affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (a) a
majority of the voting power of the shares present and entitled to vote on that item of business or (b) a majority of the voting power
of the minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a duly held
meeting of shareholders.

Subdivision 2. A shareholder voting by proxy authorized to vote on less than all items of business considered at the meeting
shall be considered to be present and entitled to vote only with respect to those items of business for which the proxy has authority
to vote. A proxy who is given authority by a shareholder who abstains with respect to an item of business shall be considered to
have authority to vote on that item of business.

Section 1.12   Action Without a Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders of the
Corporation may be taken without a meeting by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication,
by all of the shareholders entitled to vote on that action. The written action is effective when it has been signed, or consented to by
authenticated electronic communication, by all of those shareholders, unless a different effective time is provided in the written
action.

DIRECTORS

Section 2.01   Number; Qualifications. Except as authorized by the shareholders pursuant to a shareholder control agreement or
unanimous affirmative vote, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of one

any other business shall be held without notice at the place of and immediately after each regular meeting of the shareholders.

Section 2.06   Special Meetings. A special meeting of the Board of Directors may be called for any purpose or purposes at any

notice of the date, time and place of a meeting of the Board. A waiver of notice by a director entitled to notice is effective whether
given before, at or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally or by attendance. Attendance by a director at a meeting is
a waiver of notice of that meeting, unless the director objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because
the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and thereafter does not participate in the meeting.

Subdivision 2. If the day or date, time and place of a Board meeting have been provided herein or announced at a previous
meeting of the Board, no notice is required. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given other than by announcement at the
meeting at which adjournment is taken of the date, time and place at which the meeting will be reconvened.

Section 2.08   Quorum. The presence in person of a majority of the directors currently holding office shall be necessary to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the directors present may adjourn a
meeting from time to time without further notice until a quorum is present. If a quorum is present when a duly called or held
meeting is convened, the directors present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though the withdrawal of a
number of the directors originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum.

Section 2.09   Acts of Board. Except as otherwise required by law or specified in the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation, the Board shall take action by the affirmative vote of the greater of (a) a majority of the directors present at a duly held
meeting at the time the action is taken or (b) a majority of the minimum proportion or number of directors that would constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at the meeting.

telephone, or, if authorized by the Board, by any other means of remote communication through which the director, other directors

participating is deemed present at the meeting.

Section 2.11   Absent Directors. A director of the Corporation may give advance written consent or opposition to a proposal to
be acted on at a Board meeting. If the director is not present at the meeting, consent or opposition to a proposal does not constitute
presence for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum,

same or has substantially the same effect as the proposal to which the director has consented or objected.

a meeting by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of the directors. Any action,
other than an action requiring shareholder approval, if the Articles of Incorporation so provide, may be taken by written action
signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by the number of directors that would be required to take the
same action at a meeting of the Board at which all directors were present. The written action is effective when signed, or consented
to by authenticated electronic communication, by the required number of directors, unless a different effective time is provided in
the written action. When written action is permitted to be taken by less than all directors, all directors shall be notified immediately
of its text and effective date.

the Board. To the extent permitted by law, a vacancy on the committee may be filled by a majority vote of the remaining committee
members. The good faith determinations of the committee are binding upon the Corporation and its directors, officers and

adopt, amend or repeal any By-Law fixing a quorum for meetings of shareholders, prescribing procedures for removing directors or
filling vacancies in the Board, or fixing the number of directors or their classifications, qualifications or terms of office, but may
adopt or amend a By-Law that increases the number of directors.

Section 6.06   Exclusive Forum. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state or
federal courts in Hennepin County, Minnesota shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding
brought on behalf of the corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer,
employee, or agent of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation’s shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising
pursuant to any provision of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, the articles of incorporation, or these By-laws (as either may
be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to
said courts having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. If any action the subject matter
of which is within the scope of this Section 12.01 is filed in a court other than a state or federal court in Hennepin County,
Minnesota (a “Foreign Action”) by any shareholder, such shareholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (a) the personal
jurisdiction of the state or federal courts in Hennepin County, Minnesota in connection with any action brought in any such court to
enforce this Section 6.06; and (b) having service of process made upon such shareholder in any such action by service upon such
shareholder’s counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such shareholder. If any provision of this Section 6.06 shall be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision in any other circumstance and of the remaining
provisions of this Section 6.06 (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this Section 6.06 containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application
of such provision to other persons or entities or circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Vascular Solutions (“Vascular Solutions Common Stock”)
(subject to certain exceptions), will be converted into the right to receive $56.00 in cash (the “Consideration to be Received”). The

holders of Vascular Solutions Common Stock, excluding (i) any wholly owned subsidiary of Vascular Solutions or (ii) Teleflex,
Merger Sub and their respective affiliates.

In the course of performing our reviews and analyses for rendering our opinion, we have:

senior management;

• Discussed with Vascular Solutions’ senior management their views of Vascular Solutions’ business, operations, historical
and projected financial results and future prospects, including the commercial, competitive and regulatory dynamics in the

With respect to the information used in arriving at our opinion:

Solutions or obtained from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties.

• We (i) do not assume any responsibility, obligation or liability for the accuracy, completeness, reasonableness,

express no view, opinion, representation, guaranty or warranty (in each case, express or implied) regarding the
reasonableness or achievability of the Vascular Solutions Projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking
information or the assumptions upon which they are based and (iii) have relied upon the assurances of Vascular Solutions’
senior management that they are unaware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information (including,
without limitation, the Vascular Solutions Projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information)
incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.

• Specifically, with respect to (i) the Vascular Solutions Projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking
information furnished by or discussed with Vascular Solutions, (a) we have been advised by Vascular Solutions’ senior
management, and we have assumed, that the Vascular Solutions Projections, any other estimates and any other forward-
looking information utilized in our analyses have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments of Vascular Solutions’ senior management as to the expected future performance of Vascular
Solutions and (b) we have assumed that the Vascular Solutions Projections, such other estimates and such other forward-
looking information have been reviewed by Vascular Solutions’ Board of Directors with the understanding that such
information will be used and relied upon by us in connection with rendering our opinion and (ii) any financial projections,
other estimates and/or other forward-looking information obtained by us from public sources, data suppliers and other
third parties, we have assumed that such information is reasonable and reliable.

from selected third parties regarding a potential transaction with Vascular Solutions, and we have considered the results of such
solicitation in rendering our opinion.

Solutions or any other entity or the solvency or fair value of Vascular Solutions or any other entity, nor have we been furnished with
any such appraisals. We are not expressing any view or rendering any opinion regarding the tax consequences of the Merger to
Vascular Solutions or its securityholders. We are not legal, regulatory, tax, consulting, accounting, appraisal or actuarial experts and
nothing in our opinion should be construed as constituting advice with respect to such matters; accordingly, we have relied on the
assessments of Vascular Solutions and its other advisors with respect to such matters.

In rendering our opinion, we have assumed that, in all respects meaningful to our analyses, (i) the final executed form of the
Agreement will not differ from the draft that we have reviewed, (ii) each of Vascular Solutions, Teleflex and Merger Sub will
comply with all terms of the Agreement and (iii) the representations and warranties of Vascular Solutions, Teleflex and Merger Sub
contained in the Agreement are true and correct and all conditions to the obligations of each party to the Agreement to consummate
the Merger will be satisfied without any waiver, amendment or modification thereof. We also have assumed that the Merger will be
consummated in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws,
documents and other requirements, without any delays, limitations, restrictions, conditions, waivers, amendments or modifications
(regulatory, tax-related or otherwise) that would have an effect on Vascular Solutions or the Merger in any way meaningful to our
analyses or opinion.

In rendering our opinion, we do not express any view or opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the shares of Vascular
Solutions Common Stock or other securities of Vascular Solutions may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time, including
subsequent to the announcement or consummation of the Merger.

We have acted as a financial advisor to Vascular Solutions in connection with the Merger and will receive a customary fee for such
services, a substantial portion of which is contingent on successful consummation of the Merger. A portion of our compensation is
payable upon the delivery of our opinion and will be credited against the fee payable upon consummation of the Merger. In addition,
Vascular Solutions has agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses and to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our
engagement.

Other than our current engagement by Vascular Solutions, Guggenheim Securities, LLC (“Guggenheim Securities”) has not during
the past two years been formally engaged to provide any investment banking or financial advisory services to, or received any
investment banking or financial advisory fees from, either Vascular Solutions or Teleflex. As previously disclosed, however, during
the past two years Guggenheim Securities has maintained relationships with both Vascular Solutions and Teleflex and may seek to
provide Vascular Solutions, Teleflex and their respective affiliates with certain financial advisory and investment banking services
unrelated to the Merger in the future, for which services Guggenheim Securities would expect to receive compensation.

any other transaction in which Vascular Solutions might engage. Our opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of
view and as of the date hereof, of the Consideration to be Received by holders of Vascular Solutions Common Stock, excluding (i)
any wholly owned subsidiary of Vascular Solutions or (ii) Teleflex, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates. We do not express

Subdivision 1.   Actions creating rights. A shareholder of a corporation may dissent from, and obtain payment for the fair
value of the shareholder’s shares in the event of, any of the following corporate actions:

(a) unless otherwise provided in the articles, an amendment of the articles that materially and adversely affects the rights
or preferences of the shares of the dissenting shareholder in that it:

(1) alters or abolishes a preferential right of the shares;

(2) creates, alters, or abolishes a right in respect of the redemption of the shares, including a provision respecting a
sinking fund for the redemption or repurchase of the shares;

(3) alters or abolishes a preemptive right of the holder of the shares to acquire shares, securities other than shares, or
rights to purchase shares or securities other than shares;

(4) excludes or limits the right of a shareholder to vote on a matter, or to cumulate votes, except as the right may be
excluded or limited through the authorization or issuance of securities of an existing or new class or series with similar or
different voting rights; except that an amendment to the articles of an issuing public corporation that provides that section
302A.671 does not apply to a control share acquisition does not give rise to the right to obtain payment under this section;
or

(5) eliminates the right to obtain payment under this subdivision;

(b) a sale, lease, transfer, or other disposition of property and assets of the corporation that requires shareholder approval
under section 302A.661, subdivision 2, but not including a disposition in dissolution described in section 302A.725,
subdivision 2, or a disposition pursuant to an order of a court, or a disposition for cash on terms requiring that all or
substantially all of the net proceeds of disposition be distributed to the shareholders in accordance with their respective
interests within one year after the date of disposition;

(c) a plan of merger, whether under this chapter or under chapter 322B or 322C, to which the corporation is a constituent
organization, except as provided in subdivision 3, and except for a plan of merger adopted under section 302A.626;

(d) a plan of exchange, whether under this chapter or under chapter 322B or 322C, to which the corporation is a party as
the corporation whose shares will be acquired by the acquiring organization, except as provided in subdivision 3;

(e) a plan of conversion is adopted by the corporation and becomes effective;

(f) an amendment of the articles in connection with a combination of a class or series under section 302A.402 that reduces
the number of shares of the class or series owned by the shareholder to a fraction of a share if the corporation exercises its right
to repurchase the fractional share so created under section 302A.423; or

(g) any other corporate action taken pursuant to a shareholder vote with respect to which the articles, the bylaws, or a
resolution approved by the board directs that dissenting shareholders may obtain payment for their shares.

Subd. 2.   Beneficial owners. (a) A shareholder shall not assert dissenters’ rights as to less than all of the shares registered in
the name of the shareholder, unless the shareholder dissents with respect to all the shares that are beneficially owned by another
person but registered in the name of the shareholder and discloses the name and address of each beneficial owner on whose behalf
the shareholder dissents. In that event, the rights of the dissenter shall be determined as if the shares as to which the shareholder has
dissented and the other shares were registered in the names of different shareholders.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

inform each shareholder of the right to dissent and shall include a copy of section 302A.471 and this section and a brief
description of the procedure to be followed under these sections.

Subd. 3.   Notice of dissent. If the proposed action must be approved by the shareholders and the corporation holds a
shareholder meeting, a shareholder who is entitled to dissent under section 302A.471 and who wishes to exercise
dissenters’ rights must file with the corporation before the vote on the proposed action a written notice of intent to demand
the fair value of the shares owned by the shareholder and must not vote the shares in favor of the proposed action.

Subd. 4.   Notice of procedure; deposit of shares. (a) After the proposed action has been approved by the board and,
if necessary, the shareholders, the corporation shall send to (i) all shareholders who have complied with subdivision 3, (ii)
all shareholders who did not sign or consent to a written action that gave effect to the action creating the right to obtain
payment under section 302A.471, and (iii) all shareholders entitled to dissent if no shareholder vote was required, a notice
that contains:

(1) the address to which a demand for payment and certificates of certificated shares must be sent in order to obtain
payment and the date by which they must be received;

(2) any restrictions on transfer of uncertificated shares that will apply after the demand for payment is received;

(3) a form to be used to certify the date on which the shareholder, or the beneficial owner on whose behalf the
shareholder dissents, acquired the shares or an interest in them and to demand payment; and

(4) a copy of section 302A.471 and this section and a brief description of the procedures to be followed under these
sections.

(b) In order to receive the fair value of the shares, a dissenting shareholder must demand payment and deposit certificated
shares or comply with any restrictions on transfer of uncertificated shares within 30 days after the notice required by paragraph
(a) was given, but the dissenter retains all other rights of a shareholder until the proposed action takes effect.

Subd. 5.   Payment; return of shares. (a) After the corporate action takes effect, or after the corporation receives a valid
demand for payment, whichever is later, the corporation shall remit to each dissenting shareholder who has complied with
subdivisions 3 and 4 the amount the corporation estimates to be the fair value of the shares, plus interest, accompanied by:

(1) the corporation’s closing balance sheet and statement of income for a fiscal year ending not more than 16 months
before the effective date of the corporate action, together with the latest available interim financial statements;

(2) an estimate by the corporation of the fair value of the shares and a brief description of the method used to reach
the estimate; and

(3) a copy of section 302A.471 and this section, and a brief description of the procedure to be followed in demanding
supplemental payment.

(b) The corporation may withhold the remittance described in paragraph (a) from a person who was not a shareholder on
the date the action dissented from was first announced to the public or who is dissenting on behalf of a person who was not a
beneficial owner on that date. If the dissenter has complied with subdivisions 3 and 4, the corporation shall forward to the
dissenter the materials described in paragraph (a), a statement of the reason for withholding the remittance, and an offer to pay
to the dissenter the amount listed in the materials if the dissenter agrees to accept that amount in full satisfaction. The dissenter
may decline the offer and demand payment under subdivision 6. Failure to do so entitles the dissenter only to the amount
offered. If the dissenter makes demand, subdivisions 7 and 8 apply.

(c) If the corporation fails to remit payment within 60 days of the deposit of certificates or the imposition of transfer
restrictions on uncertificated shares, it shall return all deposited certificates and cancel all transfer restrictions. However, the
corporation may again give notice under subdivision 4 and require deposit or restrict transfer at a later time.

Subd. 6.   Supplemental payment; demand. If a dissenter believes that the amount remitted under subdivision 5 is less than
the fair value of the shares plus interest, the dissenter may give written notice to the corporation of the dissenter’s own estimate of
the fair value of the shares, plus interest, within 30 days after the corporation mails the remittance under subdivision 5, and demand
payment of the difference. Otherwise, a dissenter is entitled only to the amount remitted by the corporation.

Subd. 7.   Petition; determination. If the corporation receives a demand under subdivision 6, it shall, within 60 days after
receiving the demand, either pay to the dissenter the amount demanded or agreed to by the dissenter after discussion with the
corporation or file in court a petition requesting that the court determine the fair value of the shares, plus interest. The petition shall
be filed in the county in which the registered office of the corporation is located, except that a surviving foreign corporation that
receives a demand relating to the shares of a constituent domestic corporation shall file the petition in the county in this state in
which the last registered office of the constituent corporation was located. The petition shall name as parties all dissenters who have
demanded payment under subdivision 6 and who have not reached agreement with the corporation. The corporation shall, after
filing the petition, serve all parties with a summons and copy of the petition under the Rules of Civil Procedure. Nonresidents of this
state may be served by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law. Except as otherwise provided, the Rules of
Civil Procedure apply to this proceeding. The jurisdiction of the court is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint appraisers,
with powers and authorities the court deems proper, to receive evidence on and recommend the amount of the fair value of the
shares. The court shall determine whether the shareholder or shareholders in question have fully complied with the requirements of
this section, and shall determine the fair value of the shares, taking into account any and all factors the court finds relevant,
computed by any method or combination of methods that the court, in its discretion, sees fit to use, whether or not used by the
corporation or by a dissenter. The fair value of the shares as determined by the court is binding on all shareholders, wherever
located. A dissenter is entitled to judgment in cash for the amount by which the fair value of the shares as determined by the court,
plus interest, exceeds the amount, if any, remitted under subdivision 5, but shall not be liable to the corporation for the amount, if
any, by which the amount, if any, remitted to the dissenter under subdivision 5 exceeds the fair value of the shares as determined by
the court, plus interest.

Subd. 8.   Costs; fees; expenses. (a) The court shall determine the costs and expenses of a proceeding under subdivision 7,
including the reasonable expenses and compensation of any appraisers appointed by the court, and shall assess those costs and
expenses against the corporation, except that the court may assess part or all of those costs and expenses against a dissenter whose
action in demanding payment under subdivision 6 is found to be arbitrary, vexatious, or not in good faith. (b) If the court finds that
the corporation has failed to comply substantially with this section, the court may assess all fees and expenses of any experts or
attorneys as the court deems equitable. These fees and expenses may also be assessed against a person who has acted arbitrarily,
vexatiously, or not in good faith in bringing the proceeding, and may be awarded to a party injured by those actions. (c) The court
may award, in its discretion, fees and expenses to an attorney for the dissenters out of the amount awarded to the dissenters, if any.
