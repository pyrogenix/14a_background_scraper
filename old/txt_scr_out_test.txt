Echelon Corporation
2901 Patrick Henry Drive

Santa Clara, CA 95054
July 30, 2018

Dear Echelon Stockholder:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders, which we refer to as the “special meeting,” of Echelon Corporation, which
we refer to as “Echelon,” to be held on Thursday, September 13, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, at Echelon’s principal executive offices, located at
2901 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054.

At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 28,
2018, as it may be amended from time to time, which we refer to as the “merger agreement,” by and among Echelon, Adesto Technologies Corporation,
which we refer to as “Adesto,” and Circuit Acquisition Corporation. We refer to the acquisition of Echelon by Adesto as the “merger.” At the special
meeting, you will also be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal for the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (2) a
proposal to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to its named executive officers in connection with the merger on a
non-binding, advisory basis.

If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $8.50 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes, for each
share of common stock that you own (unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights), which represents a premium of approximately 104%
over the closing price of Echelon’s common stock on June 28, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger.

Echelon’s Board of Directors, after considering the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, has unanimously
(1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable
and in the best interests of Echelon and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Echelon’s Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the
adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by
Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the special meeting, the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the
merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.

This proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of Echelon’s Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger
agreement and the merger. We encourage you to read this proxy statement and its annexes, including the merger agreement, carefully and in their
entirety, as they contain important information.

Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person, please sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in
the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. If you attend the special meeting and vote
in person by ballot, your vote will

revoke any proxy that you have previously submitted. If you fail to return your proxy or to attend the special meeting in person, your shares will not be
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption of
the merger agreement.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the
voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the
proposals to be considered at the special meeting without your instructions. Without your instructions, your shares will not be counted for purposes of a
quorum or voted at the meeting, and that will have the same effect as voting against the adoption of the merger agreement.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own.

principal executive offices are located at 2901 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054, and its telephone number is (408) 938-5200.

Adesto Technologies Corporation

Adesto is a leading provider of innovative application-specific semiconductors for the IoT era. Adesto’s technology is used by more than
2,000 customers worldwide who are creating differentiated solutions across industrial, consumer, medical and communications markets. With its
growing portfolio of high-value technologies, Adesto is helping its customers usher in the era of the Internet of Things.

Table of Contents

Merger Sub’s principal executive offices are located at c/o Adesto Technologies Corporation, 3600 Peterson Way, Santa Clara, California
95054, and its telephone number is (408) 400-0578.

Effect of the Merger

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the merger,
(1) Merger Sub will merge with and into Echelon; (2) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease; and (3) Echelon will continue as
the surviving corporation in the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Adesto. Throughout this proxy statement, we use the term “surviving
corporation” to refer to Echelon as the surviving corporation following the merger.

As a result of the merger, Echelon will cease to be a publicly traded company. If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of
capital stock of the surviving corporation as a result of the merger.

The time at which the merger becomes effective (which we refer to as the “effective time of the merger”) will occur upon the filing of a
certificate of merger with, and acceptance of that certificate by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as Echelon, Adesto
and Merger Sub may agree and specify in such certificate of merger).

Effect on Echelon if the Merger is Not Completed

If the merger agreement is not adopted by Echelon stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Echelon stockholders
will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, (1) Echelon will remain an independent
public company; (2) our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”); and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which
we refer to as the “SEC”).

Per Share Merger Consideration

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each outstanding share of Echelon’s common
stock (which we refer to as “common stock”) (other than shares held by (1) Adesto, Echelon or their respective subsidiaries; or (2) stockholders
who have properly and validly exercised, and not withdrawn or otherwise lost, their appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive $8.50 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. We refer to this amount
as the “per share merger consideration.”

At or prior to the closing of the merger, a sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated payment agent to pay the aggregate
per share merger consideration. Once an Echelon stockholder has provided the payment agent with his, her or its stock certificates (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of a stock certificate) or customary agent’s message with respect to book-entry shares, letter of transmittal and the other items specified
by the payment agent, the payment agent will promptly pay the stockholder the per share merger consideration. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures.”

After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration, but you will no longer have any rights as
a stockholder (except that Echelon stockholders who properly and validly exercise and perfect, and do not validly withdraw or otherwise lose, their
appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as
contemplated by Delaware law, as described below under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights”).

The Special Meeting

Date, Time and Place

A special meeting of Echelon stockholders will be held on September 13, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, at Echelon’s principal executive
offices, located at 2901 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054. We refer to the special meeting, and any adjournment, postponement
or other delay of the special meeting, as the “special meeting.”

Purpose

At the special meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement; (2) adjourn the special meeting to a
later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time
of the special meeting; and (3) approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote

You are entitled to vote at the special meeting if you owned shares of common stock as of the close of business on July 27, 2018 (which we
refer to as the “record date”). For each share of common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the record date, you will have one vote
on each matter submitted for a vote at the special meeting.

Quorum

As of the record date, there were 4,542,310 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. The holders of a
majority of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum.

Required Vote

The proposals to be voted on at the special meeting require the following votes:
 

 
•  Proposal 1: Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the

outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting.
 

 
•  Proposal 2: Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are

insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority
of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

 

 

•  Proposal 3: Approval of the proposal to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present in
person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. This vote will be on a non-binding, advisory
basis.

Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers

As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 341,990 shares of
common stock, representing approximately 7.5 percent of the shares of common stock outstanding on the record date. Our directors and executive
officers have informed us that they intend to

vote all of their shares of common stock (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a
later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time
of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

Voting and Proxies

Any stockholder of record entitled to vote at the special meeting may vote in one of the following ways:
 

 (1) by proxy, by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
 

 (2) by proxy, by granting a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone; or
 

 (3) in person, by appearing at the special meeting and voting by ballot.

If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by
(1) signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it prior to the special meeting; (2) submitting a new proxy electronically over the
internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; (3) delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
(4) attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of common stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should
instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of common stock using the instructions provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters,
but not on non-routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the special meeting are non-routine matters, and banks, brokers and other
nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you cast your vote or instruct your
bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding
how to change your vote. You may also vote in person by ballot at the special meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

Recommendation of the Echelon Board and Reasons for the Merger

The Echelon Board, after considering various factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—
Recommendation of the Echelon Board and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Echelon and its stockholders; and
(2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

The Echelon Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of
the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

Fairness Opinion of Piper Jaffray & Co.

Piper Jaffray & Co. (which we refer to as “Piper Jaffray”), financial advisor to Echelon, delivered its opinion to the Echelon Board that, as of
June 28, 2018, and based upon and subject to the factors and

assumptions set forth therein, the $8.50 in cash per share of Echelon common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Adesto and its affiliates) of
the outstanding shares of Echelon common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

The full text of the written opinion of Piper Jaffray, dated June 28, 2018, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and is
incorporated by reference. Piper Jaffray provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the Echelon Board in connection with its
consideration of the merger. The Piper Jaffray opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of Echelon common stock should vote with
respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or any other matter. The engagement letter between Echelon and Piper Jaffray provides for a
transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $1.9 million, the principal
portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger.

Treatment of Equity Awards in the Merger

The merger agreement provides that Echelon’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
be treated as follows in the merger:

Company Options

At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase shares of Echelon common stock (which we refer to as a “company option”)
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, will, be cancelled and converted
into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the per share merger consideration less
the exercise price per share attributable to such company option by (2) the total number of shares of common stock underlying such company
option. We refer to this amount as the “option consideration.” The payment of the option consideration will be subject to any applicable
withholding taxes.

With respect to any company options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such company options is equal to or greater than
the per share merger consideration, such company options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in exchange for such
cancellation.

Company RSUs

At the effective time of the merger, each restricted stock unit (which we refer to as a “company RSU”) outstanding as of immediately prior to
the effective time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the per share merger consideration by (2) the total number of shares of Echelon common
stock underlying such company RSU. We refer to this amount as the “RSU consideration.” For the purposes of this calculation, the number of
shares of common stock issuable pursuant to a company RSU will be deemed to be the number of shares issuable following full performance and
satisfaction of the target (to the extent applicable). The payment of the RSU consideration will be subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

Employee Benefits

From and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will (and Adesto will cause the surviving corporation to) honor all
of Echelon’s compensatory plans, programs, policies, practices, agreements and arrangements (which we refer to collectively as “Echelon benefit
plans”) and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger.

However, except as provided in the following paragraph, nothing will prohibit the surviving corporation from amending or terminating any
Echelon benefit plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable
law.

For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger and with respect to the continuing employees (as defined below)
employed within that period:
 

 

•  the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Adesto will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) either
(1) maintain for the benefit of each continuing employee the Echelon benefit plans and any other employee benefits plans (other than
opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits, severance and, subject to the previous paragraph, individual employment
agreements) of the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries (which we refer to as the “company plans”) on terms and conditions
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect at Echelon on the date of the merger agreement, and provide benefits to
each continuing employee pursuant to such company plans; (2) provide benefits to each continuing employee that, taken as a whole, are
no less favorable in the aggregate to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Adesto or its affiliates (which we refer to
collectively as “Adesto benefit plans”); or (3) provide some combination of company plans and Adesto benefit plans such that each
continuing employee receives benefits that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate to those benefits provided to
similarly situated employees of Adesto;

 

 
•  Adesto or its subsidiaries shall provide continuing employees with severance benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those

benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Adesto or its affiliates; and
 

 

•  neither Adesto nor its subsidiaries shall reduce the aggregate cash compensation, including base salary and target incentive
compensation opportunity, payable to any continuing employee. “Continuing employees” means each individual who is an employee of
Echelon immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and continues to be an employee of Adesto or one of its subsidiaries
(including the surviving corporation) immediately following the effective time of the merger.

To the extent that a company plan or Adesto benefit plan is made available to any continuing employee at or after the effective time of the
merger, the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Adesto will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause to be
granted to such continuing employee credit for all service with Echelon prior to the effective time of the merger for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (1) each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries (other than the company plans) (which we
refer to as the “new plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such new plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable company plan in
which such continuing employee participates immediately before the effective time of the merger (which we refer to as the “old plans”); (2) for
purposes of each new plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits to any continuing employee, the
surviving corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination
requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such new plan to be waived for such
continuing employee and his or her covered dependents, and the surviving corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the old plan ending on the
date that such continuing employee’s participation in the corresponding new plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such new plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible,

co-payments, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new plan; and (3) credit the accounts of such continuing
employees pursuant to any new plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such continuing employee. Any
vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be credited
to such continuing employee following the effective time of the merger, will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture, and will not limit
future accruals.

Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Echelon Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you
should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as
a stockholder. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger and (3) recommending
that the merger agreement be adopted by Echelon stockholders, the Echelon Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that
they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests include the following:
 

 
•  the potential accelerated vesting, upon the effective time of the merger, of company options, company RSUs, or both, as described in

more detail under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards;” and

 

 

•  the entitlement of each executive officer to receive payments and benefits pursuant to certain agreements entered into prior to the
commencement of discussions or negotiations regarding the merger if, within the applicable period following the merger, the executive
officer experiences a qualifying termination of his or her employment, as described in more detail below under the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon
Termination Following Change of Control.”

If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved, the common stock held by our directors and executive officers will be
treated in the same manner as the common stock held by all other stockholders. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Appraisal Rights

If the merger is consummated, Echelon stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously
hold such shares through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain other conditions and
statutory requirements described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be
entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that these stockholders will be
entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of
common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of 5% over the
Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger
and the date of payment of the judgment (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation pays
to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between
the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless
paid at that time). The surviving corporation is

Table of Contents

under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process,
stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal
rights.

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger
agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.

Only a stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record must (1) submit a
written demand for appraisal to Echelon before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy,
in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (3) continue to hold the subject shares of common stock of record through the effective
time of the merger; and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly
the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss
appraisal proceedings in respect of Echelon unless certain conditions are satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal, as described further below.
The requirements under Section 262 of the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and a copy
of Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you
hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your
bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank,
broker or other nominee.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined under the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of common stock in the
merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such
U.S. Holder receives in the merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in
the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger.” Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the
merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal income tax laws or the laws of any state,
local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

No regulatory approvals are expected to be required in connection with the merger.

No Solicitation of Other Offers

Under the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger (or the earlier termination of the
merger agreement), Echelon has agreed to cease and terminate any activities,

discussions or negotiations with, and terminate any data room access (or other access to diligence) of, any person and its representatives relating to
an acquisition transaction (as defined under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other
Offers”) and to request that any person (other than Adesto and its representatives) who executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of acquiring Echelon promptly return or destroy all non-public information furnished by or on behalf of Echelon prior to the date of
the merger agreement.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger (or the earlier
termination of the merger agreement), Echelon and its directors and executive officers will not and Echelon will not authorize or direct any of its or
its subsidiaries’ employees, consultants or other representatives, directly or indirectly, to:
 

 
•  solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any

proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal (as defined under the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers”);

 

 

•  furnish to any person (other than Adesto, Merger Sub or any of their respective designees) any non-public information relating to
Echelon or any of Echelon’s subsidiaries or afford to any person access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-
public information, or to any personnel, of Echelon or any of Echelon’s subsidiaries (other than Adesto, Merger Sub or any of their
respective designees), in any such case in connection with any acquisition proposal or with the intent to induce the making, submission
or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an acquisition proposal or the making of any proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

 

 
•  participate, or engage in discussions or negotiations, with any person with respect to an acquisition proposal or with respect to any

inquiries from third parties relating to the making of, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal;
 

 •  approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal;
 

 
•  enter into an alternative acquisition agreement (as defined under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement

—No Solicitation of Other Offers”); or
 

 •  authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Notwithstanding these restrictions, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Echelon stockholders, Echelon and the Echelon Board
(or a committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their representatives, following the execution of an acceptable
confidentiality agreement: (1) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with; (2) furnish any non-public information relating to Echelon
to; or (3) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Echelon to, in
each case, any person that has made or delivered to Echelon a written acquisition proposal that was not solicited in breach of the non-solicitation
restrictions above, but only if the Echelon Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that (i) such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal (as defined under the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers”) or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal; and (ii) the
failure to do so would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Other Offers.”

Echelon is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal unless it complies with certain
procedures in the merger agreement. If Echelon terminates the merger agreement

in order to accept a superior proposal, it must pay a $1.54 million termination fee to Adesto. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—The Echelon Board’s Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change.”

Change in the Echelon Board’s Recommendation

The Echelon Board may not withdraw its recommendation that Echelon stockholders adopt the merger agreement or take certain similar
actions other than, under certain circumstances, if it (or a committee of the Echelon Board) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the Echelon Board’s fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable law and the Echelon Board (or a committee thereof) complies with the provisions of the merger agreement.

Moreover, the Echelon Board cannot withdraw its recommendation that Echelon stockholders adopt the merger agreement or take certain
similar actions unless it complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with Adesto
during a specified period. If Echelon terminates the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including because the Echelon Board
withdraws its recommendation that Echelon stockholders adopt the merger agreement, then Echelon must pay a $1.54 million termination fee to
Adesto. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—The Echelon Board’s Recommendation;
Company Board Recommendation Change.”

Conditions to the Closing of the Merger

The obligations of Adesto, Merger Sub and Echelon, as applicable, to consummate the merger, are subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(where permitted by applicable law) of certain conditions, including the following:
 

 •  the adoption of the merger agreement by the requisite affirmative vote of Echelon stockholders; and
 

 •  the consummation of the merger not being prohibited, made illegal or enjoined.

In addition, the obligations of Adesto and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where permitted by
applicable law) of each of the following additional conditions, any of which may be waived exclusively by Adesto:

Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties”) having occurred after the date of merger agreement that is continuing as of the
effective time of the merger;

 

 
•  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Echelon in the merger agreement, subject to materiality qualifiers, as of the

•  the performance and compliance in all material respects by Echelon of and with the covenants and obligations required to be performed

In addition, the obligation of Echelon to consummate the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where permitted by applicable law)
of each of the following additional conditions, any of which may be waived exclusively by Echelon:

appealable; or (2) any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation or order prohibiting, making illegal or enjoining the
consummation of the merger has been enacted, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the merger;

 

 

•  the merger has not been consummated before 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on December 1, 2018, (which we refer to as the
“termination date”), except that a party may not terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision if such party’s action
or failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement and is the primary cause of, or has primarily resulted in, the failure
to satisfy the conditions to the closing of the merger or the failure to consummate the merger by the termination date; or

 

 

•  Echelon stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting (except that a party may not terminate the
merger agreement pursuant to this provision if such party’s action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement

is then capable of being satisfied); (2) Echelon has provided irrevocable written notice to Adesto at least three business days
prior to such termination that it is prepared, willing and able to close the merger; (3) at all times during such three business day

other circumstances, Echelon may be obligated to reimburse up to $440,000 of Adesto’s expenses.

meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to you. We encourage you to carefully read the more detailed
information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, including the annexes to this proxy statement and the other documents to which we refer in this
proxy statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

 
Q: Why am I receiving these materials?
 

A: On June 29, 2018, we announced that Echelon entered into the merger agreement. Under the merger agreement, Adesto will acquire Echelon for
$8.50 per share in cash. In order to complete the merger, Echelon stockholders must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting.
The approval of this proposal by Echelon stockholders is a condition to the consummation of the merger. See the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger.” The Echelon Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of
proxy card to the holders of shares of common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies of Echelon stockholders to be voted at the
special meeting.

This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement, the special
meeting and the matters to be voted on at the special meeting. The enclosed materials allow you to submit a proxy to vote your shares of common
stock without attending the special meeting and to ensure that your shares of common stock are represented and voted at the special meeting.

Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy as soon as possible.

 
Q: What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on Echelon?
 

A: The proposed merger is the acquisition of Echelon by Adesto. If the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is approved by Echelon stockholders
and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge with and into Echelon, with Echelon
continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Echelon will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Adesto, and our common
stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from Nasdaq. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange
Act, and we may no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

 
Q: What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?
 

A: You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
 

 
•  to adopt the merger agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Echelon, and Echelon will become a wholly owned

subsidiary of Adesto;
 

 
•  to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are

insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and
 

 
•  to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger on

a non-binding, advisory basis.

 
Q: When and where is the special meeting?
 

A: The special meeting will take place on Thursday, September 13, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, at Echelon’s principal executive offices, located
at 2901 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054.

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
 

A: All Echelon stockholders as of the close of business on July 27, 2018, which is the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to vote their
shares of common stock at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 4,542,310 shares of common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly
brought before the special meeting.

 
Q: May I attend the special meeting and vote in person?
 

A: Yes. Subject to the requirements described in this proxy statement, all Echelon stockholders of record as of the record date may attend the special
meeting and vote in person. Seating will be limited. Stockholders will need to present proof of ownership of shares of common stock, such as a
bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification to be admitted to the special meeting. No cameras, recording
equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the special meeting.

Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the special meeting, we encourage you to
sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or
by telephone. If you attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy previously submitted.

If, as of the record date, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” you may not vote your shares in person at the special meeting
unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares in person at the special
meeting. Otherwise, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instruction
form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals to be
considered at the special meeting without your instructions. Without your instructions, your shares will not be counted for purposes of a quorum
or voted at the meeting, which will have the same effect as voting against the adoption of the merger agreement.

 
Q: What will I receive if the merger is completed?
 

A: Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive $8.50 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes,
for each share of common stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised, and not validly withdrawn or subsequently lost, your appraisal
rights under the DGCL, and certain other conditions under the DGCL are satisfied. For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will
receive $850.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

 
Q: How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of the common stock prior to the public announcement of the

merger agreement?
 

A: The per share merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 104% over the closing price of the common stock on June 28, 2018,
the last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger.

 
Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement
carefully and consider how the merger affects you. Then, even if you expect to attend the special meeting, please sign, date and return, as promptly
as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by
telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction
forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock certificates or
surrender your book-entry shares to the payment agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of common stock
represented by your stock certificates. Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates
or book-entry shares for the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

 
Q: What happens if I sell or transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special meeting?
 

A: The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the expected effective date of the merger. If you sell or
transfer your shares of common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a
proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares and each of you notifies Echelon in writing of such special
arrangements, you will transfer the right to receive the per share merger consideration, if the merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell
or transfer your shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or transfer your shares of
common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid
reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone.

 
Q: How does the Echelon Board recommend that I vote?
 

A: The Echelon Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the
special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

 
Q: Why am I being asked to cast a vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive

officers in connection with the merger?
 

A: SEC rules require Echelon to seek approval of compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis. Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger is not required to complete the merger.

 
Q: What is the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger?
 

A: The compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is certain
compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to certain of Echelon’s named executive officers pursuant to underlying plans and
arrangements that are contractual in nature. Compensation that will or may become payable by Adesto to our named executive officers in
connection with or following the merger is not subject to this advisory vote. For further information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Proposal 3: Approval of Certain Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements on a Non-Binding, Advisory Basis.”

 
Q: What will happen if Echelon stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to its named

executive officers in connection with the merger?
 

A: Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is not a
condition to completion of the merger. The vote to approve the

Table of Contents

 

compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is an advisory vote and
will not be binding on Echelon or Adesto. The underlying plans and arrangements providing for such compensation are contractual in nature and
are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by Echelon stockholders and the merger
is completed, the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger will or
may be paid to Echelon’s named executive officers even if Echelon stockholders do not approve such compensation.

 
Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?
 

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by Echelon stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Echelon stockholders will
not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, (1) Echelon will remain an independent public company; (2) our common
stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports with
the SEC.

Echelon has agreed to pay Adesto a termination fee of $1.54 million if the merger agreement is terminated in specified circumstances. In other
circumstances, Echelon may be obligated to reimburse up to $440,000 of Adesto’s expenses.

Adesto has agreed to pay Echelon a termination fee of $4.41 million if the transaction is terminated due to, generally speaking, Adesto’s failure to
close the merger following receipt of Echelon stockholder approval of the merger.

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees.”

 
Q: What vote is required to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement?
 

A: The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock is required to adopt the merger agreement.

The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone; or (3) vote in person
by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. If you hold your
shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve (1) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies

if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (2) the proposal to approve the
compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to its named executive officers in connection with the merger on a non-
binding, advisory basis?

 

A: Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt
the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

Approval of the proposal to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection
with the merger, on a non-binding, advisory basis, requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present in
person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone; or (3) vote in person
by ballot at the special meeting will not have any effect on the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting, or the proposal to approve the
compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger on a non-binding,
advisory basis. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not
have any effect on these proposals. In all cases, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals.

 
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
 

A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Inc., you are considered, with respect to those shares, to
be the “stockholder of record.” If you are a stockholder of record, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on
behalf of Echelon. As a stockholder of record, you may attend the special meeting and vote your shares in person by ballot.

If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of common stock held in
“street name.” If you are a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in “street name,” this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by
your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you
have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited
to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person by ballot at the
special meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special
meeting.

 
Q: How may I vote?
 

A: If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with Computershare Inc., our transfer
agent), there are four ways to vote:

 

 •  by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
 

 •  by visiting the internet address on your proxy card;
 

 •  by calling the toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or
 

 •  by attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of common stock and to
confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Although there is
no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as internet access and
telephone charges for which you will be responsible.

Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of common stock by proxy. If you are a
stockholder of record or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your shares of common stock in
person by ballot at the special meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present at the special meeting and vote in person by
ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service is provided by your
bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the internet or by telephone. To vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank,
broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your

bank, broker or nominee. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person by ballot at the special
meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

 
Q: What is a proxy?
 

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of common stock. The written document
describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document used to designate a proxy
to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.” Alicia Jayne Moore, our SVP, Chief Legal and Administration Officer and
Secretary, and C. Michael Marszewski, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the
proxy holders for the special meeting.

 
Q: If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
 

A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at the special
meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be counted for the purpose of a quorum or voted on such proposals,
which will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the adjournment
proposal or the proposal to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection
with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

 
Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
 

A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by:
 

 •  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
 

 •  attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how
to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the special meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee
giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

 
Q: If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
 

A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your shares in the way that you direct.

If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by
your properly signed proxy will be voted as recommended by the Echelon Board with respect to each proposal. This means that they will be voted
(1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and
(3) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger on a
non-binding, advisory basis.

Table of Contents

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A: We encourage you to sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting
instruction form that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.

You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting
instruction forms, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account. For example, if you hold your shares in more than
one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a
stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote all voting
materials that you receive.

 
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
 

A: If available, Echelon may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. Echelon intends to publish final voting
results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that Echelon files with the SEC are
publicly available when filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

 
Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger?
 

A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal
to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
shares of common stock surrendered in the merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the merger
unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax
consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income
tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger is provided in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger.”

 
Q: What will the holders of company options and company RSUs receive in the merger?
 

A: At the effective time of the merger, each company option outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the option
consideration. The payment of the option consideration will be subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

With respect to any company options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such company options is equal to or greater than the per
share merger consideration, such company options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in exchange for such cancellation.

At the effective time of the merger, each company RSU outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether vested or
unvested, will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an

amount in cash, without interest, equal to the RSU consideration. For the purposes of the previous sentence, the number of shares of Echelon
common stock issuable pursuant to a company RSU will be deemed to be the number of shares issuable following full performance and
satisfaction of the target (to the extent applicable). The payment of the RSU consideration will be subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

For more detail on the treatment of our directors’ and executive officers’ company options and company RSUs in the merger, see below under the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of
Equity-Based Awards.”

 
Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?
 

A: We currently expect to complete the merger in 2018. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because
the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.

 
Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
 

A: If the merger is consummated, Echelon stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold
such shares through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory
requirements described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to
seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to
have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of
Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to
be fair value from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of 5% over the Federal Reserve discount
rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment
of the judgment (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each stockholder
entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid
and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time).
The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Stockholders who wish to
seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to
the complexity of the appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy
statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights attached as Annex C to this
proxy statement.

 
Q: Do any of Echelon’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Echelon stockholders generally?
 

A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Echelon Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware
that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Echelon
stockholders generally. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and
(3) unanimously recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by Echelon stockholders, the Echelon Board was aware of and considered
these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included in oral statements or other written
statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts.
You can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words, such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “project,” “believe,”
“anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “potential,” “plan,” “forecast” and other words of similar import. Stockholders are cautioned that any
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may
vary materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our
filings with the SEC, including in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this
proxy statement, and the following factors:
 

 
•  the inability to complete the merger due to the failure of Echelon stockholders to adopt the merger agreement or failure to satisfy the other

conditions to the completion of the merger;
 

 
•  the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay a termination fee of $1.54 million or obligate

us to reimburse up to $440,000 of Adesto’s expenses;
 

 •  the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the merger agreement;
 

 •  risks that the merger affects our ability to retain or recruit employees;
 

 
•  the fact that receipt of the all-cash per share merger consideration will be taxable to Echelon stockholders that are treated as U.S. holders for

U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 
•  the fact that, if the merger is completed, Echelon stockholders will forego the opportunity to realize the potential long-term value of the

successful execution of Echelon’s current strategy as an independent company;
 

 
•  the possibility that Echelon could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts, special dividends or the

sale of some or all of Echelon’s assets to one or more as yet unknown purchasers, that could conceivably produce a higher aggregate value
than that available to Echelon stockholders in the merger;

 

 
•  the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, Echelon is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the pendency of the

merger;
 

 
•  the effect of the announcement or pendency of the merger on our business relationships, customers, operating results and business generally,

including risks related to the diversion of the attention of Echelon management or employees during the pendency of the merger;
 

 •  the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the merger agreement or the merger;
 

 •  the risk that the proposed merger will not be consummated in a timely manner, exceeding the expected costs of the merger;
 

 •  the risk that our stock price may decline significantly if the merger is not completed;
 

 •  risks regarding the failure of Adesto to obtain the necessary financing to consummate the merger; and
 

 •  risks related to obtaining the requisite stockholder consent to the merger.

Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the information contained or
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, including (1) the information contained under this caption; and (2) the information contained under
the caption “Risk Factors,” and information in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our most recent filings on Form 10-K
and Form 10-Q. No assurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward-looking
statements.

THE SPECIAL MEETING

This proxy statement is being provided to Echelon stockholders as part of a solicitation by the Echelon Board of proxies for use at the special
meeting.

Date, Time and Place

We will hold the special meeting on Thursday, September 13, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, at our principal executive offices, located at 2901
Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement; (2) adjourn the special meeting to a later
date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the
special meeting; and (3) approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the
merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum

Only Echelon stockholders as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. A list of
stockholders of record entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available at our principal executive offices located at 2901 Patrick Henry Drive,
Santa Clara, CA 95054, during regular business hours for a period of no less than 10 days before the special meeting and at the place of the special
meeting during the meeting.

As of the record date, there were 4,542,310 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of common
stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter properly brought before the special meeting.

The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the
special meeting will constitute a quorum at the special meeting.

Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
common stock entitled to vote on the proposal. Adoption of the merger agreement by Echelon’s stockholders is a condition to the closing of the merger.

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt
the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present
in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by
proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted: (1) “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement; (2) “AGAINST” any proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the merger

agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, compensation that will or
may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of
determining whether a quorum exists.

A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because
the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote your shares. We do not expect any
“broker non-votes” at the special meeting, but if there are any, they will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. If there
are broker non-votes, each broker non-vote will count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on
(1) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at
the time of the special meeting; or (2) the proposal to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

Shares Held by Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 341,990 shares of
common stock, representing approximately 7.5 percent of the shares of common stock outstanding as of the record date. Our directors and executive
officers have informed us that they intend to vote all of their shares of common stock: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the
adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt
the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

Voting of Proxies

If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Inc., you may vote your shares by returning a signed and dated
proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or you may vote in person by ballot at the special meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy
electronically over the internet or by telephone by following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and
follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. Based on your proxy cards or internet
and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your shares according to your directions.

If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Stockholders will need to
present proof of ownership of shares of common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification to be
admitted to the special meeting. If your shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the special
meeting in person. If you attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.

All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received will, if received before the special meeting, be voted at the special meeting
in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted: (1) “FOR”
adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the compensation that
will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or other nominee by
completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank,

broker or other nominee. You may also attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot if you have a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or
other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting. If available, you may vote over the internet or telephone through your
bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do
not (1) return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting instruction form; (2) vote over the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or
other nominee, if possible; or (3) attend the special meeting and vote in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will
have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. It will not have any effect on the proposals: (1) to adjourn
the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of
the special meeting; or (2) to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with
the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

Revocability of Proxies

If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting by:
 

 •  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
 

 •  attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the special meeting, in the absence of voting in person or submitting an additional proxy or
revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding how
to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the special meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving
you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the special meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, will allow
Echelon stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the special meeting as adjourned, postponed
or delayed.

The Echelon Board’s Recommendation

The Echelon Board, after considering various factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Recommendation
of the Echelon Board and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Echelon and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the
merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

The Echelon Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the
special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

Table of Contents

Adjournment

In addition to the proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement and (2) approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to
our named executive officers in connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis, Echelon stockholders are also being asked to approve a
proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional votes or proxies in favor of the proposal
to adopt the merger agreement if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger agreement. If a quorum is not
present, the chairperson of the special meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, may
adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. In
addition, the special meeting could be postponed before it commences, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. If the special meeting is adjourned
or postponed, Echelon stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time before they are voted at the special
meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies

The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by Echelon. We have retained The Proxy Advisory Group, LLC, a professional proxy solicitation
firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies, and provide related advice and informational support during the solicitation process, for a services fee, plus
customary disbursements, which are not expected to exceed $35,000 in total. We will indemnify The Proxy Advisory Group, LLC against losses arising
out of its provisions of these services on our behalf. In addition, we may reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of
shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers and
employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax or over the internet. No additional compensation will be paid for such services.

Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger

We currently expect to complete the merger in 2018. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger, if at all, cannot be predicted because
the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control.

Appraisal Rights

If the merger is consummated, stockholders who (1) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) continuously hold such
shares through the effective time of the merger; (3) properly perfect appraisal of their shares; (4) meet certain other conditions and statutory
requirements described in this proxy statement; and (5) do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will be entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that such stockholders will be entitled to seek
appraisal of their shares by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery
in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from
the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment at a rate of 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any
surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment (except
that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in
cash, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no
obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish
to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.

Table of Contents

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they would receive pursuant to the merger
agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.

Only a stockholder of record may submit a demand for appraisal. To exercise appraisal rights, the stockholder of record must (1) submit a written
demand for appraisal to Echelon before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (3) continue to hold the subject shares of common stock of record through the effective time of the merger;
and (4) strictly comply with all other procedures for exercising appraisal rights under the DGCL. The failure to follow exactly the procedures specified
under the DGCL may result in the loss of appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of
Echelon unless certain conditions are satisfied by the stockholders seeking appraisal, as described further below. The requirements under Section 262 of
the DGCL for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, which description is qualified in its entirety by
Section 262 of the DGCL, the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights, a copy of which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.
If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with
your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank,
broker or other nominee.

Other Matters

At this time, we know of no other matters to be voted on at the special meeting. If any other matters properly come before the special meeting,
your shares of common stock will be voted in accordance with the discretion of the appointed proxy holders.

Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Stockholder Meeting to be Held on September 13, 2018

Householding of Special Meeting Materials

name will receive only one copy of this proxy statement unless one or more of these stockholders notifies us that they wish to continue receiving
individual copies. This procedure reduces printing costs, postage fees and the use of natural resources. Each stockholder who participates in
householding will continue to be able to access or receive a separate proxy card.

Corporation, 2901 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054; or (2) by telephone at (408) 938-5252.

If you are a stockholder who has multiple accounts in your name or you share an address with other stockholders and would like to receive a
single set of our disclosure documents for your household, you may notify your broker, if your shares are held in a brokerage account. If you hold
registered shares, you may contact our Corporate Secretary using the contact method above.

THE MERGER

The rights and obligations of the parties to the merger agreement are governed by the specific terms and conditions of the merger agreement and
not by any summary or other information in this proxy statement. Therefore, this discussion of the merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. You should
read the entire merger agreement carefully as it is the legal document that governs the merger.

Parties Involved in the Merger

Echelon Corporation
2901 Patrick Henry Drive
Santa Clara, CA 95054
(408) 938-5200

Echelon has pioneered the development of open-standard networking platforms for connecting, monitoring and controlling devices in commercial
and industrial applications. With more than 140 million connected devices installed worldwide, Echelon’s solutions host a range of applications enabling
customers to reduce energy and operational costs, improve safety and comfort, and create efficiencies through optimizing physical systems. Echelon is
focusing today on two IoT (Internet of Things) market areas: creating smart cities and smart campuses through connected outdoor lighting systems, and
enabling device makers to bring connected products to market faster via a range of IoT-optimized embedded systems.

Echelon’s common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “ELON.”

Adesto Technologies Corporation
3600 Peterson Way
Santa Clara, CA 95054
(408) 400-0578

Adesto is a leading provider of innovative application-specific semiconductors for the IoT era. Adesto’s technology is used by more than 2,000
customers worldwide who are creating differentiated solutions across industrial, consumer, medical and communications markets. With its growing
portfolio of high-value technologies, Adesto is helping its customers usher in the era of the Internet of Things.

Adesto’s common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “IOTS.”

Circuit Acquisition Corporation
3600 Peterson Way
Santa Clara, CA 95054
(408) 400-0578

Merger Sub is a wholly owned subsidiary of Adesto and was formed on June 22, 2018, solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. Merger Sub has not engaged in any business activities other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

Effect of the Merger

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the merger,
(1) Merger Sub will merge with and into Echelon; (2) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease; and (3) Echelon will continue as the
surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Adesto.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/31347/000119312518232076/d474838ddefm14a.htm 39/197

Table of Contents

As a result of the merger, Echelon will cease to be a publicly traded company. If the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of capital
stock of the surviving corporation.

The effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with, and acceptance of that certificate by, the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (or at a later time as we, Adesto and Merger Sub may agree and specify in such certificate of merger).

Effect on Echelon if the Merger is Not Completed

If the merger agreement is not adopted by Echelon stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Echelon stockholders will
not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, (1) Echelon will remain an independent public
company; (2) our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq and registered under the Exchange Act; and (3) we will continue to file
periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, we expect that: (1) our management will operate the business in a manner
similar to that in which it is being operated today; and (2) Echelon stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which
they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which Echelon operates and adverse economic conditions.

Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be completed, the price of our
common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to the price at
which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of the merger not being completed on the future value of
your shares of common stock. If the merger is not completed, the Echelon Board will continue to evaluate and review, among other things, Echelon’s
business, operations, strategic direction and capitalization, and will make whatever changes it deems appropriate. If the merger agreement is not adopted
by Echelon stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Echelon’s business, prospects or results of operation may be adversely
impacted.

Per Share Merger Consideration

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger:
 

 

•  each share of common stock that is (1) held by Echelon as treasury stock; (2) owned by Adesto or Merger Sub; or (3) owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Echelon, Adesto or Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (which we
refer to as the “Owned Company Shares”) will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor;
and

 

 

•  each share of common stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than Owned
Company Shares and shares of common stock held by Echelon stockholders who have (1) neither voted in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement nor consented thereto in writing; and (2) properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of
such shares in accordance with the Delaware law) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive
cash in an amount equal to $8.50, without interest thereon.

At or prior to the closing of the merger, a sufficient amount of cash will be deposited with a designated payment agent to pay the aggregate per
share merger consideration. Once a Echelon stockholder has provided the payment agent with his, her or its stock certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu
of a stock certificate) or customary agent’s message with respect to book-entry shares, letter of transmittal and other items specified by the payment

agent, the payment agent will promptly pay the stockholder its per share merger consideration. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures.”

After the merger is completed, each Echelon stockholder will have the right to receive its per share merger consideration, as described in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conversion of Shares,” but will no longer have any rights as a Echelon stockholder
(except that Echelon stockholders who properly and validly exercise and perfect, and do not validly withdraw or subsequently lose, their appraisal rights
will have the right to receive payment for the “fair value” of their shares, determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding contemplated by Delaware law
as described below under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights”).

Background of the Merger

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the Merger Agreement. This chronology does not
purport to catalogue every conversation of or among the Echelon Board, Echelon’s representatives, and other parties. Other than as described below,
there have been no material contacts between Echelon and Adesto in the past two years.

The Echelon Board regularly evaluates Echelon’s strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward strengthening Echelon’s
business and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the Echelon Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic
alternatives. These have included, among others, (1) the continuation of Echelon’s current business plan as a standalone entity; (2) investment in, and
development of, new products; (3) potential expansion opportunities into new business lines through acquisitions and combinations of Echelon with
other businesses, as well as through potential partnerships or other commercial relationships; (4) the sale of Echelon or one or more of its business units;
and (5) strategic investments in Echelon and other capital raising activities.

In 2012, Echelon retained an internationally recognized investment bank to assist the Echelon Board in understanding, among other things, market
trends, public and industry perspectives on its business, and potential strategic alternatives for Echelon. In 2014, with the assistance of that investment
bank, the Echelon Board began to focus on a potential sale of Echelon’s smart metering business, although the Echelon Board remained open to all
potential strategic alternatives. In September 2014, Echelon completed the sale of its smart metering business.

Beginning in early 2015 and continuing into 2016, with the assistance of that investment bank, the Echelon Board conducted a comprehensive
review of strategic alternatives for Echelon. Echelon publicly announced this process on August 6, 2015. As part of this process, Echelon contacted over
60 potential acquirers, composed of a mix of strategic buyers and private equity firms. Although Echelon engaged in preliminary discussions with
various parties, this process did not result in any specific proposal.

By late 2016, the Echelon Board was no longer actively pursuing a review of strategic alternatives due to a lack of interested parties, although it
did not formally terminate the review process. From time to time, members of Echelon management received communications from parties considering
a transaction with Echelon. These communications were exploratory in nature and each was evaluated by Echelon management. None of these
communications resulted in a specific proposal.

In late February 2017, Ronald A. Sege, Echelon’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, was contacted by a representative of a
company referred to as “Party A” concerning Party A’s interest in pursuing an acquisition of Echelon. Party A was not among the potential acquirers
contacted as part of Echelon’s prior reviews of strategic alternatives in 2014 and 2015.

On March 21, 2017, Party A sent a letter to Echelon proposing to acquire Echelon in an all-cash transaction for $6.25 per share of common stock.

In late March 2017 and again in early April 2017, the Echelon Board met to review the proposal from Party A. Members of Echelon management
and representatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, legal counsel to Echelon (which we refer to as “Wilson Sonsini”)
attended these meetings. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Echelon Board their fiduciary duties as directors. The
Echelon Board authorized Echelon management to continue discussions with Party A. The Echelon Board also authorized Echelon management to enter
into a limited period of exclusivity if Echelon management determined that was appropriate in order to secure a transaction.

During the remainder of April 2017 and into May 2017, members of Echelon management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini negotiated the
key terms of an acquisition of Echelon by Party A. Echelon management kept the Echelon Board regularly updated on the status of negotiations with
Party A. From the start of discussions with Party A, Echelon repeatedly stressed its need to understand Party A’s proposed financing in order to properly
evaluate Party A’s acquisition proposal.

On May 18, 2017, Party A and Echelon signed a term sheet for Party A to acquire Echelon for $7.50 per share in cash. Echelon also agreed to
negotiate exclusively with Party A for 30 days. The exclusivity period was later extended to June 30, 2017.

Throughout June 2017 and into July 2017, Party A engaged in an extensive due diligence review of Echelon. In addition, Party A and its legal
counsel exchanged numerous drafts of a proposed merger agreement with Echelon and Wilson Sonsini.

By late June 2017, Party A had missed numerous deadlines to provide information to the Echelon Board concerning how Party A would obtain the
financing necessary to consummate an acquisition of Echelon.

On June 30, 2017, Party A requested an extension of Echelon’s obligation to negotiate exclusively with Party A. Echelon declined to extend the
exclusivity period but agreed to continue to work with Party A toward a possible acquisition of Echelon.

On July 21, 2017, the Echelon Board met, with members of Echelon management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. It was the
consensus of the Echelon Board that Echelon should not actively pursue additional discussions with Party A until Party A could provide definitive
information on how it would obtain the financing necessary to consummate an acquisition of Echelon. The Echelon Board remained open to future
discussions with Party A should it provide such documentation. As the engagement with the investment bank retained in 2012 had concluded, the
Echelon Board authorized Echelon management to interview investment banks in connection with a possible review of strategic alternatives for
Echelon.

After July 21, 2017, members of Echelon management had sporadic contact with representatives of Party A concerning Party A’s continued
interest in an acquisition of Echelon. During these discussions, members of Echelon management reiterated the willingness of the Echelon Board to
continue acquisition discussions following Echelon’s receipt of customary financing documentation. Party A never provided evidence of its ability to
secure the financing necessary to consummate an acquisition of Echelon.

In September 2017, members of each of Adesto management and Echelon management met to discuss a potential commercial collaboration, but
these discussions did not result in an agreement at that time. This represented the first discussions of any type between Adesto management and Echelon
management.

On September 21, 2017, the Echelon Board met, with members of Echelon management in attendance. Representatives of Wilson Sonsini also
attended a portion of this meeting. Echelon management discussed with the Echelon Board the results of its interviews of several investment banks. The
Echelon Board selected Piper Jaffray to serve as its financial advisor in connection with a possible sale of Echelon or one or more of its businesses. The
Echelon Board selected Piper Jaffray due to that firm’s qualifications, expertise, international

reputation and knowledge of the industry in which Echelon operates, and Piper Jaffray’s experience in similar situations. Although the Echelon Board
expressed a preference for selling all of the common stock in a single transaction—as it believed that outcome would best maximize stockholder value—
it informed Piper Jaffray of the Echelon Board’s willingness to consider any type of value-enhancing transaction, including (1) a sale of one or more of
Echelon’s businesses and (2) a substantial investment in Echelon.

On September 25, 2017, Adesto entered into a confidentiality agreement with Echelon.

On October 5, 2017, members of each of Adesto management and Echelon management met to discuss the state of their respective businesses.

On October 6, 2017, Echelon formally engaged Piper Jaffray to serve as its financial advisor.

Starting in October 2017 and continuing into February 2018, Piper Jaffray, using an evolving process, ultimately contacted 132 potential acquirers,
composed of 109 strategic buyers (including Adesto) and 23 private equity firms. These potential acquirers were composed of a mix of parties
previously contacted during earlier recent reviews of strategic alternatives and other parties not previously contacted that were thought to have an
interest in a transaction with Echelon. Echelon determined not to contact Party A about participating in this process due to concerns about Party A’s lack
of sufficient financial resources to complete an acquisition of Echelon.

In December 2017, Adesto received access to an online data room containing due diligence information about Echelon and began its due diligence
review of Echelon

In late January 2018, Echelon received three preliminary, non-binding indications of interest. Adesto proposed an all-cash acquisition of Echelon
for $7.25 to $8.00 per share of common stock. A company referred to as “Party B” proposed an all-cash acquisition of Echelon for $8.11 per share of
common stock. A private equity firm referred to as “Party C” proposed an all-cash acquisition of Echelon for $8.00 per share of common stock. Party C
also submitted a separate proposal to, among other things, acquire a minority stake in Echelon in lieu of a full acquisition.

On January 31, 2018, the Echelon Board met, with members of Echelon management and representatives of each of Piper Jaffray and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Piper Jaffray reviewed for, and discussed with, the Echelon Board a summary of Piper Jaffray’s
preliminary financial analysis of Echelon. The Echelon Board determined that Echelon management and representatives of Piper Jaffray should continue
discussions with Adesto, Party B and Party C with the goal of improving the terms of their respective preliminary proposals. In addition, the Echelon
Board instructed Piper Jaffray to continue discussions with other parties that were considering a transaction with Echelon but had yet to make a formal
proposal.

On February 21, 2018, Piper Jaffray notified those parties that were still considering a transaction with Echelon, including Adesto, Party B and
Party C, that they should submit final proposals by March 22, 2018.

In February 2018 and into March 2018, Echelon management and Piper Jaffray assisted various interested parties, including Adesto, Party B and
Party C, with due diligence in order to allow them to develop an increased understanding of Echelon and its prospects.

In early March 2018, Echelon made available a draft of the merger agreement for review by those parties that were still considering a transaction
with Echelon.

On March 22, 2018, Echelon received four preliminary, non-binding indications of interest. Adesto proposed an all-cash acquisition of Echelon
for $7.50 per share of common stock. Adesto’s proposal also required that Echelon have at least $17 million in cash on hand at the closing. Party B
proposed an all-cash

acquisition of Echelon for $7.97 per share of common stock. Party B’s proposal provided that its obligation to close the acquisition would be
conditioned on the agreement of two of Echelon’s key suppliers to extend the terms of their supply agreements. Party B also requested, as part of its due
diligence investigation, interviews with numerous Echelon employees, many of whom were not aware that Echelon was conducting a review of strategic
alternatives. Party C proposed an all-cash acquisition of Echelon for $8.75 per share of common stock. Party C’s proposal also required that Echelon
have at least $18 million in cash on hand at the closing. A private equity firm referred to as “Party D” proposed an all-cash acquisition of Echelon for
$8.68 per share of common stock. Party D’s proposal also required that Echelon have at least $20 million in cash on hand at the closing. The proposals
from Adesto, Party B, Party C and Party D were accompanied by a request for Echelon to negotiate with the respective party on an exclusive basis.
Echelon also received a highly preliminary proposal from an investor referred to as “Party E” to acquire Echelon’s lighting business for little value.

On April 4, 2018, Party D reduced the value of its proposal to $7.74 per share in cash, citing the impact of anticipated transaction-related expenses
on Echelon’s projected cash balance.

On April 5, 2018, the Echelon Board met, with members of Echelon management and representatives of each of Piper Jaffray and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Echelon Board their fiduciary duties as directors. The Echelon
Board reviewed the proposals from Adesto, Party B, Party C, Party D and Party E. The Echelon Board discussed that, although the proposal from
Party C had the highest value per share, the financial resources of Party C were unproven. The Echelon Board was concerned that the investment funds
directly managed by Party C would provide a comparatively small amount of the equity portion of its proposal; most of the equity investment would
come from a number of third parties, each of which had their own due diligence requirements and internal approvals processes. The significant debt
required by Party C’s proposal was also a concern for the Echelon Board. Although Party C’s proposal included a debt commitment letter from a
financing source, the due diligence and other conditions in that letter, in the opinion of the Echelon Board, imposed potentially significant risk on Party
C’s ability to complete a transaction with Echelon. The Echelon Board also considered its overall familiarity with Party C, as certain of its principals
previously discussed a number of transaction structures with Echelon management during and after Echelon’s review of strategic alternatives in 2015.
Despite the investment of significant time and attention by Echelon management, these discussions never advanced beyond the exploratory structuring
stage. In comparison, the proposals from Adesto and Party B did not include financing contingencies and were from operating companies with
meaningful assets and the ability to access the capital markets. In the case of Party B, that company then had sufficient cash on its balance sheet to pay
for an acquisition of Echelon. In view of (1) the greater certainty of closing of a transaction with Adesto or Party B as compared to Party C; (2) concerns
over Party C’s ability to secure the necessary debt and equity financing to consummate a transaction with Echelon as compared to Adesto and Party B;
(3) the higher per share price of Party B’s proposal as compared to Adesto’s; and (4) the cash resources of Party B, the Echelon Board instructed
Echelon management and Piper Jaffray to seek to improve the terms of Party B’s proposal. In order to seek to preserve a competitive bidding dynamic,
the Echelon Board also instructed Piper Jaffray to continue to engage with Adesto, Party C and Party D in the hopes of preserving their interest in an
acquisition as well as potentially causing them to improve the price and deal certainty terms of their respective proposals. With respect to Party E, the
Echelon Board determined that it was not presently interested in considering Party E’s proposal in view of the significantly more attractive nature of the
proposals received from Adesto and Party B. The Echelon Board also authorized Echelon management to enter into a limited period of exclusivity if
Echelon management determined that was appropriate in order to secure a transaction. The Echelon Board stressed the importance that it placed on
certainty of closing; the Echelon Board believed that announcing and failing to close an acquisition of Echelon would be significantly damaging to
Echelon’s business.

Following the meeting of the Echelon Board on April 5, 2018, representatives of Piper Jaffray contacted representatives of Adesto, Party B, Party
C and Party D and informed each that its respective proposal was not differentiated from the proposals received from other bidders and that each should
improve the terms of its proposal. Party D declined to change its proposal.

On April 11, 2018, Party B increased the value of its proposal to $8.31 per share of common stock. Party B continued to insist on burdensome due
diligence requirements (including a significant number of employee interviews) and, as conditions to closing, the extension of two supply agreements.

On April 12, 2018, Adesto increased the value of its proposal to $8.50 per share of common stock.

On April 13, 2018, following consultation with members of Echelon management, representatives of Piper Jaffray informed representatives of
each of Adesto, Party B and Party C that their respective revised proposals were not differentiated from the proposals received from other bidders and
that each should further improve the terms of its proposal.

On April 14, 2018, Party B modified the terms of its proposal such that, as conditions to closing an acquisition of Echelon, (1) one of Echelon’s
key suppliers would need to agree to extend the terms of its supply agreement; and (2) another key supplier would need to confirm that it did not intend
to terminate its supply agreement. Party B informed Echelon that it would not further change its proposed purchase price. As part of its due diligence
investigation, Party B continued to insist on interviews with certain Echelon employees who were not aware that Echelon was conducting a review of
strategic alternatives. Despite repeated efforts, members of Echelon management were unable to get Party B to agree to remove these closing conditions
or to conduct these interviews after a transaction with Party B was announced. Echelon management was of the opinion that the closing conditions
insisted on by Party B resulted in significant uncertainty as to Party B’s obligation to consummate an acquisition of Echelon, as it conditioned the
closing on the actions of third parties. This uncertainty was inconsistent with the Echelon Board’s stated desire for a transaction that had a high degree of
certainty. Echelon management was also concerned about disclosing the strategic review process to additional employees and third parties. Accordingly,
and in review of the higher per share price offered by Adesto, Echelon management began to focus on pursuing a transaction with Adesto.

On April 16, 2018, Mr. Sege communicated with Narbeh Derhacobian, Adesto’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Sege conveyed
Echelon’s concerns with the minimum cash closing condition requested by Adesto.

From April 16, 2018, to April 19, 2018, Echelon and Adesto negotiated the amount of cash that Echelon was required to have at the closing for
Adesto to be obligated to proceed with the acquisition. Adesto ultimately proposed that Echelon have at least $12.55 million of cash as of the end of
July 31, 2018, and that this amount be adjusted for certain expenses that Echelon had incurred, and would continue to incur, in connection with a
transaction with Adesto.

On April 18, 2018, Party C submitted a revised proposal for a minority investment in Echelon. This proposal did not include the use of debt
financing but was otherwise not materially different from Party C’s prior minority investment proposal.

On April 19, 2018, Adesto and Echelon signed a term sheet for Adesto to acquire Echelon for $8.50 per share of common stock. Echelon also
agreed to negotiate exclusively with Adesto until May 10, 2018, with the ability for Adesto to extend this period by seven days.

On April 24, 2018, on behalf of Adesto, representatives of Fenwick & West LLP, legal counsel to Adesto (which we refer to as “Fenwick”),
provided comments to a draft merger agreement.

From April 24, 2018, until May 15, 2018, representatives of Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of Echelon, and representatives of Fenwick on behalf of
Adesto, negotiated the terms of the merger agreement. The key items of negotiation were (1) the nature of any reimbursement of Adesto’s expenses in
connection with a termination of the merger agreement; (2) the financing commitments to be made by Adesto; and (3) the obligations of Echelon during
the period between signing of the merger agreement and the closing of the merger.

On May 7, 2018, Adesto elected to extend the exclusivity period to May 17, 2018.

On May 8, 2018, Mr. Derhacobian informed Mr. Sege that Adesto was in advanced discussions to acquire another company.

On May 9, 2018, Adesto publicly announced the acquisition of S3 Semiconductors using financing from a senior term loan.

On May 12, 2018, and May 14, 2018, members of Adesto management communicated separately with members of Echelon management and
representatives of Piper Jaffray. During these conversations, the members of Adesto management stated that Adesto intended to pursue an equity
offering to finance the acquisition of Echelon and would not secure debt financing at that time to fund the acquisition.

Early on May 15, 2018, representatives of Fenwick, on behalf of Adesto, provided a revised draft of the merger agreement to representatives of
Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of Echelon. Among other things, this draft provided that Adesto (1) would use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
financing necessary for an acquisition of Echelon; and (2) would pay Echelon a termination fee of approximately $3 million as a sole and exclusive
remedy if Echelon terminated the merger agreement because Adesto did not consummate the merger after all closing conditions were satisfied.

Later on May 15, 2018, the Echelon Board met, with members of Echelon management and representatives of each of Piper Jaffray and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. The Echelon Board discussed the status of the acquisition by Adesto and the terms of Adesto’s latest draft of the merger
agreement. The Echelon Board determined that the transaction proposed by Adesto was unacceptable because there was no certainty that Adesto could
obtain the necessary financing to acquire Echelon. As a result, the Echelon Board viewed the exclusivity agreement with Adesto to no longer be in
effect. The Echelon Board instructed Echelon management and Piper Jaffray to inform Adesto of this and promptly begin discussions with other
potentially interested parties.

Following the meeting of the Echelon Board on May 15, 2018, Echelon delivered a letter to Adesto stating that, in light of Adetso’s statements
and intentions, the exclusivity agreement was no longer effective. Representatives of Piper Jaffray also contacted Party B and Party C to determine
whether either was still interested in an acquisition of Echelon. Party B and Party C later confirmed their respective continued interest.

On May 17, 2018, representatives of Piper Jaffray, following consultation with members of Echelon management, delivered a draft merger
agreement to representatives of Party B that reflected negotiated terms that Echelon was prepared to agree to immediately.

Throughout the remainder of May 2018 and into June 2018, members of Echelon management and representatives of Piper Jaffray had continued
discussions with representatives of Adesto, Party B and Party C concerning their interest in an acquisition of Echelon. With respect to Adesto, these
discussions also included periodic updates on the status of Adesto’s efforts to obtain the financing necessary for an acquisition of Echelon.

On May 31, 2018, Party B informed representatives of Piper Jaffray that Party B would not actively pursue an acquisition of Echelon and would
instead wait to see if Echelon entered into a transaction with another party.

On June 7, 2018, Party C delivered a new proposal to Echelon. This proposal contemplated Party C making a significant minority investment in
Echelon, with Echelon using the proceeds from that investment to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, the Echelon Board
would be substantially reconstituted. Party C did not provide specific information as to its operational plan for Echelon following the investment.

On June 8, 2018, Adesto renewed its proposal to acquire Echelon for $8.50 per share of common stock. Although Adesto did not then have
sufficient cash to acquire Echelon, it stated that it was making plans to

conduct an equity offering in the near future. Adesto reiterated its willingness to pay Echelon a termination fee of approximately $3 million if Echelon
terminated the merger agreement because Adesto did not consummate the merger after all closing conditions were satisfied.

On June 11, 2018, Party C provided additional information about its proposal and confirmed its continued interest in a minority investment in
Echelon.

On June 16, 2018, and June 19, 2018, representatives of each of Wilson Sonsini and Fenwick discussed the structure and terms of a termination
fee payable by Adesto to Echelon if Echelon terminated the merger agreement because Adesto did not consummate the merger after all closing
conditions were satisfied.

During the week of June 18, 2018, members of Echelon management negotiated with members of Adesto management the termination fee payable
by Adesto if Echelon terminated the acquisition because of Adesto’s failure to close. The parties ultimately agreed on a termination fee of $4,410,000.

Also during the week of June 18, 2018, Mr. Sege informed Mr. Derhacobian that, in Mr. Sege’s opinion, the Echelon Board would not accept any
type of minimum cash closing condition. Mr. Derhacobian informed Mr. Sege that he anticipated Adesto would no longer seek a minimum cash closing
condition.

On June 21, 2018, members of Echelon management and representatives of each of Piper Jaffray and Wilson Sonsini attended a due diligence
meeting with Adesto management and representatives of each of Fenwick, three investment banking firms assisting Adesto, and counsel to those
investment banks. During this meeting, (1) the attendees discussed the status of Adesto’s efforts to acquire Echelon; and (2) the investment banks
conducted preliminary due diligence on Echelon.

On June 22, 2018, the Echelon Board met, with members of Echelon management and representatives of each of Piper Jaffray and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. The Echelon Board discussed the proposals from Adesto and Party C and the risks and uncertainties of each. The Echelon Board
determined to proceed with additional negotiations with Adesto because, in the judgment of the Echelon Board, Adesto’s proposal had the potential to
deliver the best value (taking into consideration both deal terms and closing certainty) to Echelon stockholders.

During the week of June 25, 2018, Adesto completed its due diligence investigation of Echelon. In addition, representatives of each of Wilson
Sonsini and Fenwick completed negotiation of the merger agreement and the accompanying disclosure letter. These negotiations principally focused on
the circumstances in which Echelon could terminate the merger agreement and collect a termination fee from Adesto if it failed to close. The investment
banks retained by Adesto also continued their due diligence investigation of Echelon.

Also during the week of June 25, 2018, Adesto withdrew its request that Echelon have a minimum amount of cash at the closing.

On June 28, 2018, the Echelon Board met, with members of Echelon management and representatives of each of Piper Jaffray and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Echelon Board their fiduciary duties as directors. The
representatives of Piper Jaffray reviewed for, and discussed with, the Echelon Board the financial analyses of Piper Jaffray of the proposed consideration
of $8.50 per share of common stock pursuant to the proposed transaction with Adesto. The representatives of Piper Jaffray delivered Piper Jaffray’s oral
opinion to the Echelon Board, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June 28, 2018, to the effect that, as of June 28, 2018, and
based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken set
forth in Piper Jaffray’s written opinion, the $8.50 in cash per share of common stock to be received by the holders of common stock, other than Adesto,
Merger Sub and their respective affiliates, if any, pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of common
stock. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the Echelon Board the key terms of the merger

agreement. The members of the Echelon Board discussed potential reasons for and against entering into the merger with Adesto. The Echelon Board,
after considering the factors more fully described in this proxy statement, unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Echelon and its stockholders; and (2) adopted
and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The merger agreement was
subsequently signed.

On June 29, 2018, prior to the opening of trading of the common stock on Nasdaq, Echelon and Adesto publicly announced the signing of the
merger agreement.

On July 13, 2018, Adesto completed the sale of 6,700,000 shares of its common stock for net proceeds of $37.3 million.

On July 16, 2018, Echelon received an unsolicited letter from Janel Corporation (which we refer to as “Janel”). Janel communicated a non-binding
indication of interest to acquire Echelon in a transaction where each share of common stock would be exchanged for $9.00 per share in cash and 0.2
shares of Janel’s common stock. This transaction would require the payment by Janel of approximately $41 million and leave Echelon stockholders with
at least 51% of the combined company. Janel stated that its non-binding indication of interest was subject to the receipt of financing and the conclusion
of confirmatory due diligence. Janel’s common stock is traded on the over-the-counter market. Janel has a market capitalization of approximately $5
million and had approximately $750,000 of cash on hand as of March 31, 2018. Janel did not describe or name its sources of financing for a transaction.
Echelon had been approached by Janel in the past concerning a transaction but discussions had not proceeded beyond the preliminary stage due, in part,
to concerns about Janel’s financial capacity. Based on Janel’s lack of clear financial capacity, it was not one of the parties contacted by Piper Jaffray
concerning a potential acquisition of Echelon.

On July 18, 2018, the Echelon Board met, with members of Echelon management and representatives of each of Piper Jaffray and Wilson Sonsini
in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the Echelon Board their fiduciary duties as directors. The
representatives of Piper Jaffray reviewed for, and discussed with, the Echelon Board various perspectives on Janel and its non-binding indication of
interest of July 16, 2018. The Echelon Board considered the contingencies in Janel’s non-binding indication of interest, including (1) the lack of any
identified financing sources; and (2) the likelihood that Janel could secure sufficient debt or equity financing to consummate its proposed acquisition of
Echelon given its low amount of cash on hand and small market capitalization. The Echelon Board also considered the terms of the merger agreement,
which require, among other things, that the Echelon Board, before commencing discussions with any party concerning such party’s interest in acquiring
Echelon, determine that (1) a third party’s acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal; and
(2) the failure to commence discussions would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Echelon Board
pursuant to applicable law. The Echelon Board determined that Janel’s non-binding indication of interest did not meet the requirements of the merger
agreement to commence discussions. Accordingly, the Echelon Board directed Echelon management to inform Janel that the Echelon Board had
concluded that Echelon was prohibited under the merger agreement from engaging with Janel. Following the meeting, Echelon management informed
Janel of that conclusion.

On July 29, 2018, Echelon received another unsolicited letter from Janel. Janel communicated a non-binding indication of interest to acquire
Echelon in a transaction where each share of common stock would be exchanged for $9.25 per share in cash and 0.197 shares of Janel’s common stock,
for the same stated implied value as the consideration proposed in Janel’s July 16, 2018, non-binding indication of interest.

On July 30, 2018, the Echelon Board met, with members of Echelon management and representatives of Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The
Echelon Board considered Janel’s non-binding indication of interest of July 29, 2018, and the Echelon Board again determined that Janel’s non-binding
indication of interest did not

meet the requirements of the merger agreement to commence discussions. Accordingly, the Echelon Board directed Echelon management to inform
Janel that the Echelon Board had concluded that Echelon was prohibited under the merger agreement from engaging with Janel. Following the meeting,
Echelon management informed Janel of that conclusion.

Recommendation of the Echelon Board and Reasons for the Merger

Recommendation of the Echelon Board

The Echelon Board has unanimously (1) determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Echelon and its stockholders; and (2) adopted and approved the merger agreement, the
merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

The Echelon Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the
adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the compensation that will or may become payable by
Echelon to our named executive officers in connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis.

Reasons for the Merger

In evaluating the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the Echelon Board consulted
with Echelon management, outside legal counsel and Piper Jaffray. In recommending that Echelon stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger
agreement, the Echelon Board considered a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative
importance):
 

 

•  Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Prospects of Echelon. The current, historical and projected financial condition, results of
operations and business of Echelon, as well as Echelon’s prospects and risks if it were to remain an independent company at its current size
and scale and under current market and competitive landscape. The Echelon Board considered Echelon’s current business plans, including
(1) the risks and uncertainties associated with achieving and executing on Echelon’s business plans in the short and long term; (2) the impact
of general market, customer and competitive trends on Echelon; and (3) the general risks of market conditions that could reduce the price of
the common stock. Among the potential risks identified by the Echelon Board were:

 

 •  Echelon’s competitive positioning and prospects as a standalone company.
 

 •  The substantial costs incurred by Echelon as a public company and the relation of those costs to Echelon’s market capitalization.
 

 •  The need for continued investment in Echelon’s lighting business and the nascent nature of that business.
 

 •  The slower-than-expected development of the outdoor lighting controls market.
 

 
•  The unanticipated complexity of deploying multi-square mile outdoor lighting control systems in collaboration with partner and city

personnel.
 

 •  The increasing investment required to maintain competitiveness in the embedded systems business.
 

 

•  Certainty of Value. The consideration to be received by Echelon stockholders in the merger will consist entirely of cash, which provides
liquidity and certainty of value. The Echelon Board believed that this certainty of value was compelling compared to the long-term value
creation potential and associated execution risks underlying the business plan of Echelon as a standalone company. The Echelon Board also
considered that the merger was not subject to any financing condition.

Table of Contents

 

•  Best Value Reasonably Obtainable. The belief of the Echelon Board that the per share merger consideration represents the best value
reasonably obtainable for the shares of common stock, taking into account the Echelon Board’s familiarity with the business, operations,
prospects, business strategy, assets, liabilities and general financial condition of Echelon on a historical and prospective basis. The Echelon
Board also considered that the per share merger consideration of $8.50 (an increase from Adesto’s initial proposal of $7.25 to $8.00 per
share) constituted a premium of approximately 104 percent to the closing price of the common stock on June 28, 2018, the last trading day
before the announcement of the merger. The results of the exhaustive, multiyear strategic review processes undertaken by the Echelon
Board, which included, at various points, the retention by Echelon of two different investment banks. The Echelon Board considered that in
the most recent strategic review process, Piper Jaffray contacted 108 potential strategic acquirers (not including Adesto) and 23 private
equity firms concerning their interest in an acquisition of all or part of Echelon.

 

 

•  Fairness Opinion of Piper Jaffray. The oral opinion of Piper Jaffray to the Echelon Board, which was confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated June 28, 2018, to the effect that, as of June 28, 2018, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken set forth in Piper Jaffray’s written opinion, the $8.50 in
cash per share of common stock to be received by the holders of common stock, other than Adesto, Merger Sub and their respective
affiliates, if any, pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of common stock.

 

 

•  Potential Strategic Alternatives. The (1) possible alternatives to the merger, including the possibility of continuing to operate Echelon as an
independent entity or of pursuing a minority investment in Echelon, and the desirability and perceived risks of those alternatives;
(2) potential benefits to Echelon stockholders of these alternatives and the timing and likelihood of effecting such alternatives; and (3) the
Echelon Board’s assessment that none of these alternatives was reasonably likely to present superior opportunities for Echelon to create
greater value for Echelon stockholders, taking into account risks of execution as well as business, competitive, financial, industry, market
and regulatory risks.

 

 
•  Negotiations with Adesto and Terms of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the merger agreement and the results of negotiations with

Adesto. Based on negotiations and discussions, the Echelon Board believed that the merger agreement, which was the product of arms’-
length negotiations, contained the most favorable terms to Echelon to which Adesto was willing to agree. These terms include:

 

 
•  Echelon’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties regarding

unsolicited acquisition proposals.
 

 
•  The Echelon Board’s view that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third parties from making a superior

proposal.
 

 
•  The Echelon Board’s ability, under certain circumstances, to withdraw or modify its recommendation that Echelon stockholders vote

in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement.
 

 
•  The Echelon Board’s ability, under certain circumstances, to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an alternative acquisition

agreement. In that regard, the Echelon Board believed that the termination fee payable by Echelon in such instance was reasonable,
consistent with or below similar fees payable in comparable transactions, and not preclusive of other offers.

 

 
•  The Echelon Board’s ability, under certain circumstance, to terminate the merger agreement and collect a $4.41 million termination

from Adesto if Adesto fails to consummate the merger.
 

 •  The limited conditions to Adesto’s obligation to consummate the merger, making the merger reasonably likely to be consummated.
 

 
•  Speed and Likelihood of Completion. The anticipated timing of the consummation of the merger, including that no regulatory approvals are

necessary. The potential for closing in a relatively short time frame could also reduce the amount of time in which Echelon’s business would
be subject to the potential uncertainty of closing and related disruption.

Table of Contents

 

•  Business Reputation of Adesto. The business reputation, management and financial resources of Adesto. The Echelon Board believed that
these factors supported the conclusion that a transaction with Adesto could be completed quickly and in an orderly manner. The Echelon
Board also believed that these factors had the potential to allow Adesto to conduct a successful equity offering to generate sufficient cash to
acquire Echelon.

 

 
•  Appraisal Rights. The appraisal rights in connection with the merger available to Echelon stockholders who timely and properly exercise

such appraisal rights under Delaware law.

In recommending that Echelon stockholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement, the Echelon Board also considered a number of
uncertainties and risks and other potentially negative factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative
importance):
 

 

•  No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings. The nature of the merger as a cash transaction means that Echelon stockholders
will not participate in the future earnings or growth of Echelon, and will not benefit from any appreciation in value of the combined
company. The Echelon Board also considered the other potential alternative strategies available to Echelon, some of which potentially could
result in a more successful and valuable company.

 

 

•  Nature of Adesto’s Financing. The nature of the financing proposed to be used by Adesto to consummate the merger. The Echelon Board
considered that Adesto did not have sufficient cash resources to consummate the merger and did not have any debt financing commitments
in place. The Echelon Board also considered Adesto’s intention to conduct an equity offering to generate sufficient cash to consummate the
merger, and the risks and uncertainties of such an offering.

 

 

•  Risk Associated with Failure to Consummate the Merger. The possibility that the merger might not be consummated, and if it is not
consummated, (1) Echelon’s directors, senior management and other employees will have expended extensive time and effort and will have
experienced significant distractions from their work during the pendency of the transaction; (2) Echelon will have incurred significant
transaction costs; (3) Echelon’s continuing business relationships with customers, licensors, business partners and employees may be
adversely affected; (4) the trading price of the common stock could be adversely affected; and (5) the market’s perceptions of Echelon’s
prospects could be adversely affected.

 

 

•  Interim Restrictions on Echelon’s Business Pending the Completion of the Merger. The restrictions on the conduct of Echelon’s business
prior to the consummation of the merger, including the requirement that Echelon conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to
specific limitations, which may delay or prevent Echelon from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of
the merger and that, absent the merger agreement, Echelon might have pursued. The Echelon Board also considered the restrictions on
soliciting other acquisition proposals prior to the consummation of the merger.

 

 
•  Effects of Transaction Announcement. The effect of the public announcement of the merger agreement, including effects on Echelon’s sales,

employees, customers, operating results and stock price, and the impact of the public announcement on Echelon’s ability to attract and retain
key management, sales and marketing and technical personnel, as well as the likelihood of litigation in connection with the merger.

 

 
•  Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement. The requirement that Echelon pay Adesto a termination fee or reimburse certain of Adesto’s

expenses under certain circumstances following termination of the merger agreement, including if the Echelon Board terminates the merger
agreement to accept a superior proposal.

 

 
•  Timing Risks. The amount of time that it could take to complete the merger and the uncertainty and related disruption that could arise during

that time.

Table of Contents

 
•  Taxable Consideration. That an all-cash transaction would be taxable to Echelon stockholders that are U.S. persons for U.S. federal income

tax purposes.
 

 
•  Potential Conflicts of Interest. That Echelon’s directors and officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition

to, those of Echelon’s other stockholders.

This discussion is not meant to be exhaustive, but summarizes the material factors considered by the Echelon Board in its consideration of the
merger. After considering these and other factors, the Echelon Board concluded that the potential benefits of the merger outweighed the uncertainties
and risks. In view of the variety of factors considered by the Echelon Board and the complexity of these factors, the Echelon Board did not find it
practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations.
Moreover, each member of the Echelon Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different
weights to different factors. The Echelon Board unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement and recommended that Echelon stockholders adopt the merger agreement based upon the totality of the
information presented to and considered by the Echelon Board.

Fairness Opinion of Piper Jaffray

Echelon retained Piper Jaffray to act as financial advisor to the Echelon Board, and, if requested, to render to the Echelon Board an opinion as to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration of $8.50 in cash per share to be received by the holders of common stock, other
than Adesto, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates, if any.

The full text of the Piper Jaffray written opinion dated June 28, 2018, which sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Piper Jaffray in rendering its opinion, is
attached as Annex B. You are urged to, and should, carefully read the Piper Jaffray opinion in its entirety and this summary is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the written opinion. The Piper Jaffray opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the
date of the opinion, of the merger consideration of $8.50 in cash per share to be received by the holders of common stock (other than Adesto,
Merger Sub and their respective affiliates, if any) in the merger. Piper Jaffray’s opinion was directed to the Echelon Board in connection with
its consideration of the merger and was not intended to be, and does not constitute, a recommendation to any holders of common stock as to
how such holders should vote or act with respect to the merger or any other matter.

In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Piper Jaffray, among other things:
 

 •  reviewed and analyzed the financial terms of a draft of the merger agreement;
 

 •  reviewed and analyzed certain financial and other data with respect to Echelon that was publicly available;
 

 
•  reviewed and analyzed certain information, including financial forecasts, relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and

prospects of Echelon that were publicly available, as well as those that were furnished to Piper Jaffray by Echelon;
 

 
•  conducted discussions with members of senior management and representatives of Echelon concerning the immediately preceding matters

described above, as well as Echelon’s business and prospects before and after giving effect to the merger;
 

 
•  reviewed the current and historical reported prices and trading activity of common stock and similar information for certain other companies

deemed by Piper Jaffray to be comparable to Echelon;

 •  compared the financial performance of Echelon with that of certain other publicly-traded companies that Piper Jaffray deemed relevant;
 

 
•  reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain business combination transactions that Piper Jaffray deemed

relevant; and
 

 •  conducted a discounted cash flow analysis on Echelon based on financial forecasts that were prepared by Company management.

In addition, Piper Jaffray conducted such other analyses, examinations and inquiries and considered such other financial, economic and market
criteria as Piper Jaffray deemed necessary in arriving at its opinion.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Piper Jaffray in connection with the preparation of its fairness opinion
and reviewed with the Echelon Board at a meeting held on June 28, 2018.

This summary includes information presented in tabular format, which tables must be read together with the text of each analysis summary and
considered as a whole in order to fully understand the financial analyses presented by Piper Jaffray. The tables alone do not constitute a complete
summary of the financial analyses. The order in which these analyses are presented below, and the results of those analyses, should not be taken as any
indication of the relative importance or weight given to these analyses by Piper Jaffray or the Echelon Board. Except as otherwise noted, the following
quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before June 27, 2018, and is not
necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

For purposes of its analyses, and unless the context indicates otherwise, Piper Jaffray calculated (1) Echelon’s implied equity value based on
diluted shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding, including options and stock units calculated using the treasury stock
method; and (2) enterprise value (which is referred to as “EV”) to be implied equity value, plus debt, which in the case of Echelon was approximately
zero, as of June 27, 2018, less cash, which was approximately $18.1 million, as of May 31, 2018.

Historical Trading Analysis

Piper Jaffray reviewed the historical closing prices and trading volumes for the common stock over the one-year period ended June 27, 2018, in
order to provide background information on the prices at which the common stock has historically traded. The following table summarizes some of
these historical closing prices, and average closing prices, as well as the premium that the merger consideration reflects as compared to the reference
closing prices:
 

   
Closing Price

per Share    Premium 
Price on June 27, 2018   $ 4.15    105% 
1 day prior price (June 26, 2018)   $ 4.21    102% 
4 weeks prior price (May 28, 2018)   $ 4.25    100% 
Merger Consideration   $ 8.50    0% 

Selected Public Companies Analysis

Semiconductor Companies

Piper Jaffray reviewed projected financial data of Echelon for the year ended December 31, 2018, and compared such data to corresponding
historical balance sheet data and Wall Street research forecasts for public companies in the semiconductor industry that Piper Jaffray believed were
comparable to Echelon’s business profile. Piper Jaffray selected public semiconductor companies that it considered to be relevant, consisting of
semiconductor companies with revenue for calendar year 2017 between $35 million and $200 million, enterprise value between $20 million and
$350 million, revenue growth less than 35% in calendar year 2017, gross margin less than 75% in calendar year 2017, and excluding companies focused
on the wearables market or solar market.

Table of Contents

Based on these criteria, Piper Jaffray selected the following eight companies:
 

 •  Adesto Technologies Corporation
 

 •  Aquantia Corp.
 

 •  AudioCodes Ltd.
 

 •  Digi International Inc.
 

 •  DSP Group, Inc.
 

 •  GSI Technology, Inc. (1)
 

 •  Intermolecular, Inc. (1)
 

 •  Sequans Communications S.A.
 

 (1) EV/ revenue multiples for this company were omitted because this company was not covered by Wall Street and therefore did not have Wall Street estimates
of the 2018 calendar year revenue and for the reasons set forth below.

For the selected public semiconductor companies analysis, Piper Jaffray compared projected implied EV/revenue multiples for Echelon for the
2018 calendar year (which we refer to as “calendar year” or “CY”) based on the merger consideration, on the one hand, to the corresponding implied
EV/revenue multiples for the selected public companies derived from their closing prices per share on June 27, 2018, and their cash and debt
outstanding amounts as indicated in public filings as of such date, on the other hand. Projected CY 2018 revenue for Echelon was based on estimates
provided by Echelon management. Projected CY 2018 revenue for the selected public companies were based on Wall Street estimates. Piper Jaffray
omitted from the analysis the EV/revenue multiples of companies that were not covered by Wall Street and therefore did not have Wall Street estimates
of CY 2018 revenue.

The analysis indicated the following multiples:
 
 

  
Company(1) 

  Selected Semiconductor Public Companies  
    High    75th%   Mean    Median   25th%   Low  

EV to projected CY 2018 revenue    0.8x    3.4x    2.5x    2.1x    2.1x    1.6x    1.2x 
 
(1) Based on the merger consideration of $8.50 per share.

Based on this analysis, Piper Jaffray noted that, with respect to Echelon, based on the merger consideration, the EV/revenue multiples fell below
the “Low” end of the range of implied EV/revenue multiples for the selected public companies. In addition, Piper Jaffray observed that the range
implied per share values for common stock based on these multiples yielded the following, as compared to the merger consideration:
 
 

  Merger

Financial Profile

Piper Jaffray reviewed projected financial data of Echelon for the year ended December 31, 2018, and compared such data to corresponding
historical balance sheet data and Wall Street research forecasts for public companies headquartered in the United States that Piper Jaffray believed were
comparable to Echelon’s financial profile. Piper Jaffray selected public companies across all industries with revenue for calendar year 2017 between
$10 million and $50 million, enterprise value between $20 million and $100 million, revenue growth less than 5% in calendar year 2017, gross margin
between 30% and 60% in calendar year 2017, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which we refer to as “EBITDA”)
margin less than 0%.

 •  Innovative Solutions and Support, Inc. (1)
 

 •  IRIDEX Corporation
 

 •  Polar Power, Inc.
 

 •  Truett-Hurst, Inc. (1)
 
 (1) EV/revenue multiple for this company was omitted because this company was not covered by Wall Street and therefore did not have Wall Street estimates of

CY 2018 revenue and for the reasons set forth below.

For the selected companies in this analysis, Piper Jaffray compared calendar year projected implied EV/revenue multiples for Echelon based on
the merger consideration, on the one hand, to the corresponding implied EV multiples for the selected public companies derived from their closing
prices per share on June 27, 2018, and their cash and debt outstanding amounts as indicated in public filings as of such date, on the other hand. Projected
CY 2018 revenue for Echelon was based on estimates provided by Echelon management. Projected CY 2018 revenue for the selected public companies
were based on Wall Street estimates. Piper Jaffray omitted from the analysis the EV/revenue multiples of companies that were not covered by Wall
Street and therefore did not have Wall Street estimates of CY 2018 revenue.

The analysis indicated the following multiples:
 

 
  

Company(1) 
  

Selected Public Companies with
Similar Financial Profile  

    High    75th%   Mean    Median   25th%   Low

(1) Based on the merger consideration of $8.50 per share.

Based on this analysis, Piper Jaffray noted that, with respect to Echelon, based on the merger consideration, the EV/revenue multiples fell between
the “Low” and the 25th percentile range of implied EV/revenue multiples for the selected public companies. In addition, Piper Jaffray observed that the
range of implied per share values for common stock based on these multiples yielded the following, as compared to the merger consideration:

Selected M&A Transaction Analysis

Piper Jaffray reviewed merger and acquisition (which we referred to as “M&A”) transactions involving target companies in the technology
industry that Piper Jaffray believed were comparable to Echelon’s financial profile. Piper Jaffray selected transactions that closed after June 27, 2015,
for which it believed the targets to have been primarily public technology companies headquartered in the United States where the total transaction value
was greater than $10 million and the implied enterprise value of the target was between $10 million and $100 million.

Meru Networks, Inc.   Fortinet, Inc.   May 27, 2015
Sutron Corporation   Danaher Corporation   February 24, 2015

For the selected M&A transactions analysis, Piper Jaffray compared implied EV to the last twelve months (which is referred to as “LTM”)
revenue multiples for Echelon, based on the merger consideration, to the corresponding multiples for each selected transaction. LTM revenues for
Echelon were based on preliminary historical financial data for the 12 months ended March 31, 2018.

The analysis indicated the following multiples:
 
 

  
Company(1) 

  Selected Technology M&A Transactions  
    High    75th%   Mean    Median   25th%   Low  

EV to LTM revenue    1.0x    2.8x    1.4x    1.3x    1.1x    1.0x    0.5x 
 
(1) Based on the merger consideration of $8.50 per share.

Based on this analysis, Piper Jaffray noted that, with respect to Echelon, based on the merger consideration, the EV/revenue multiple fell between
the “Low” and 25th percentile range of implied multiples for the selected M&A transactions. In addition, Piper Jaffray observed that the implied per
share values for common stock based on these multiples yielded the following, as compared to the merger consideration:
 
 

  Merger

    High    75th%    Mean    Median    25th%    Low  

EV to LTM revenue   $ 8.50   $20.35   $11.89   $11.31   $10.07   $9.35   $6.36 

Premiums Paid Analysis

Piper Jaffray reviewed publicly available information for selected completed or pending M&A transactions to determine the premiums paid in
such transactions over recent trading prices of the target companies prior to announcement of the transaction. Piper Jaffray selected transactions for
which Piper Jaffray considered the target to be a US listed public technology company (excluding IT services and consulting companies), and applied,
among others, the following criteria:
 

 •  M&A transactions between public target and acquirer;
 

 •  transactions closed since June 27, 2015;
 

 •  enterprise value of target between $10 million and $500 million; and
 

 •  more than 50% of the target stock was acquired in the transaction.

Based on these criteria, Piper Jaffray selected 39 transactions, and the table below shows a comparison of premiums paid in the selected
transactions over certain time periods to the premium that would be paid to the holders of common stock based on the merger consideration of $8.50 per
share.

The premiums paid analysis showed that the premiums over the market prices for one day prior to the announcement of the merger for common
stock implied by the merger consideration fell between the “High” and 75th percentile range of premiums paid in the selected transactions for the
corresponding period. In addition, Piper Jaffray observed that the range of implied per share values for common stock, based on the ranges for this
analysis yielded the following, as compared to the merger consideration:
 
 

  Merger
consideration 

  Implied Per Share Value of Common Stock  
    High    75th%    Mean    Median   25th%    Low  

EV to LTM revenue   $ 8.50   $9.02   $6.32   $5.81   $ 5.56   $4.88   $3.28 

Discounted Cash Flows Analysis

Using a discounted cash flows analysis, Piper Jaffray calculated an estimated range of theoretical enterprise values for Echelon based on the net
present value of (1) projected unlevered free cash flows from May 31, 2018, to December 31, 2022, and (2) a projected terminal value at December 31,
2022 based upon terminal year multiples of projected revenue, discounted back to May 31, 2018. The free cash flows for each year and terminal year
revenue were calculated from the Financial Forecasts, which were provided to Piper Jaffray by Echelon and are described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Financial Forecasts.” Piper Jaffray calculated the range of net present values for unlevered free cash flows for such
periods based on a range of discount rates ranging from 25% to 35%, based on its estimation of Echelon’s weighted average cost of capital. Piper Jaffray
calculated a range of terminal values using terminal revenue multiples ranging from 0.5x to 1.7x applied to projected 2022 revenue, and discounted such
resulting values back to May 31, 2018, using discount rates ranging from 25% to 35%.

This analysis resulted in implied per share values for common stock ranging from $6.67 to $14.65 (excluding the value of Echelon’s net operating
losses). Piper Jaffray observed that the merger consideration was within the range of implied per share values derived from this analysis. Piper Jaffray
also calculated a theoretical range of present values of Echelon’s net operating losses based on discounting Echelon’s projected tax savings from
utilizing the net operating losses at discount rates ranging from 30% to 40%, which were selected by Piper Jaffray utilizing its professional judgment
and experience, with long-term earnings growth rates ranging from 0% to 3.0%. This analysis resulting in implied per share values of Echelon’s net
operating losses ranging from $0.88 to $1.39.

Miscellaneous

The summary set forth above does not contain a complete description of the analyses performed by Piper Jaffray and reviewed with the Echelon
Board, but summarizes the material analyses performed by Piper Jaffray in rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is not necessarily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Piper Jaffray believes that its analyses and the summary set forth above must be considered as a
whole and that selecting portions of its analyses or of the summary, without considering the analyses as a whole or all of the factors included in its
analyses, would create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses set forth in the Piper Jaffray opinion. In arriving at its opinion, Piper
Jaffray considered the results of

all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis. Instead, Piper Jaffray made its determination as to fairness on the
basis of its experience and financial judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. In addition, the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Piper Jaffray’s view of the actual value of common stock.

None of the selected companies or transactions used in the analyses above is directly comparable to Echelon or the merger. Accordingly, an
analysis of the results of the comparisons is not purely mathematical; rather, it involves considerations and judgments concerning differences in
historical and projected financial and operating characteristics of the selected companies and target companies in the selected transactions and other
factors that could affect the public trading value or transaction value of the companies involved.

Piper Jaffray performed its analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Echelon Board. In performing its analyses, Piper Jaffray made
numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters. Certain of the analyses
performed by Piper Jaffray are based upon financial projections of future results furnished to Piper Jaffray by Echelon management, which are not
necessarily indicative of actual future results and may be significantly more or less favorable than actual future results. These financial projections are
inherently subject to uncertainty because, among other things, they are based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their
respective advisors. Neither Piper Jaffray nor Echelon assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from projected financial results.

Piper Jaffray’s opinion was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Echelon Board in making the determination to approve the merger
agreement. While Piper Jaffray provided advice to the Echelon Board during Echelon’s negotiations with Adesto, the Echelon Board determined the
amount of merger consideration and Piper Jaffray did not recommend any specific amount or type of merger consideration.

Piper Jaffray relied upon and assumed, without assuming liability or responsibility for independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of
all information that was publicly available or was furnished, or otherwise made available, to Piper Jaffray or discussed with or reviewed by Piper Jaffray.
Piper Jaffray further relied upon the assurances of Echelon management that the financial information provided to Piper Jaffray by Echelon management
was prepared on a reasonable basis in accordance with industry practice, and that Echelon management was not aware of any information or facts that
would make any information provided to Piper Jaffray incomplete or misleading. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the purpose of its
opinion, Piper Jaffray assumed that with respect to financial forecasts, estimates and other forward-looking information reviewed by Piper Jaffray, that
such information was reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of Echelon management
as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of Echelon. Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion as to any such financial forecasts,
estimates or forward-looking information or the assumptions on which they were based. Piper Jaffray relied, with consent of the Echelon Board, on
advice of the outside counsel, and independent accountants to Echelon, and on the assumptions of the management of Echelon, as to all accounting,
legal, tax and financial reporting matters with respect to Echelon and the merger agreement.

In arriving at its opinion, Piper Jaffray assumed that the executed merger agreement was in all material respects identical to the last draft reviewed
by Piper Jaffray. Piper Jaffray relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (1) the representations and warranties of all parties to the
merger agreement and all other related documents and instruments that are referred to therein are true and correct; (2) each party to such agreements will
fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party; (3) the merger will be consummated pursuant to
the terms of the merger agreement without amendments thereto; and (4) all conditions to the consummation of the merger will be satisfied without
waiver by any party of any conditions or obligations thereunder. Additionally, Piper Jaffray assumed that all the necessary regulatory approvals and
consents required for the merger will be obtained in a manner that would not adversely affect Echelon or the contemplated benefits of the merger.

In arriving at its opinion, Piper Jaffray did not perform any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or liabilities (fixed, contingent or other)
of Echelon, and Piper Jaffray was not furnished or provided with any such appraisals or valuations, nor did Piper Jaffray evaluate the solvency of
Echelon under any state or federal law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. The analyses performed by Piper Jaffray in connection with
its opinion were going concern analyses. Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion regarding the liquidation value of Echelon or any other entity. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Piper Jaffray undertook no independent analysis of any pending or threatened litigation, regulatory action,
possible unasserted claims or other contingent liabilities, to which Echelon or any of its affiliates is a party or may be subject, and at Echelon’s direction
and with its consent, Piper Jaffray’s opinion made no assumption concerning, and therefore did not consider, the possible assertion of claims, outcomes
or damages arising out of any such matters. Piper Jaffray also assumed that neither Echelon nor Adesto is party to any material pending transaction,
including without limitation, any financing, recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the merger.

Piper Jaffray’s opinion was necessarily based upon the information available to it and facts and circumstances as they existed and were subject to
evaluation on the date of its opinion. Events occurring after the date of its opinion could materially affect the assumptions used in preparing its opinion.
Piper Jaffray did not undertake to reaffirm or revise its opinion or otherwise comment upon any events occurring after the date of its opinion and does
not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

Piper Jaffray’s opinion addressed solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of common stock of the proposed merger
consideration set forth in the merger agreement and did not address any other terms or agreement relating to the merger or any other terms of the merger
agreement. Piper Jaffray was not requested to opine as to, and its opinion does not address, the basic business decision to proceed with or effect the
merger, the merits of the merger relative to any alternative transaction or business strategy that may be available to Echelon, Adesto’s ability to fund the
merger consideration, or any other terms contemplated by the merger agreement or the fairness of the merger to any other class of securities, creditor or
other constituency of Echelon. Furthermore, Piper Jaffray expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of compensation to any officer,
director or employee of any party to the merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or with respect to the fairness of any
such compensation.

Information about Piper Jaffray

As a part of its investment banking business, Piper Jaffray is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses in the semiconductor industry and
other industries and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities,
private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. The Echelon Board selected Piper Jaffray to be its financial advisor and render its
fairness opinion in connection with the merger on the basis of such experience and its familiarity with Echelon.

Piper Jaffray acted as a financial advisor to Echelon in connection with the merger and will receive a fee, currently estimated to be approximately
$1.9 million, from Echelon, all of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger, except for $500,000 of such fee, which has been earned by
Piper Jaffray for rendering its fairness opinion. The opinion fee was not contingent upon the consummation of the merger or the conclusions reached in
Piper Jaffray’s opinion. Echelon has also agreed to indemnify Piper Jaffray against certain liabilities and reimburse Piper Jaffray for certain expenses in
connection with its services. In the ordinary course of its business, Piper Jaffray and its affiliates may actively trade securities of Echelon and Adesto for
its own account or the account of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In the ordinary course
of its business, Piper Jaffray also publishes research on the common stock of Echelon and the common stock of Adesto. Piper Jaffray may also, in the
future, provide investment banking and financial advisory services to Echelon or Adesto or entities that are affiliated with Echelon or Adesto, for which
Piper Jaffray would expect to receive compensation. Piper Jaffray has not acted as financial advisor to Echelon in the two years prior to the issuance of
its fairness opinion, other than in connection with the merger. Piper Jaffray

has not received fees or other compensation from Adesto in the two years prior to the issuance of its fairness opinion.

Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, Piper Jaffray has adopted policies and procedures to establish and maintain the
independence of Piper Jaffray’s research department and personnel. As a result, Piper Jaffray’s research analysts may hold opinions, make statements or
recommendations and/or publish research reports with respect to Echelon and the merger and other participants in the merger that differ from the
opinions of Piper Jaffray’s investment banking personnel.

Financial Forecasts

Echelon does not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to its future financial performance. However, Echelon has in the past provided
quarterly guidance with respect to certain metrics, including total revenues and operating expenses. Echelon management also regularly prepares
internal financial forecasts regarding its future operations for subsequent fiscal years.

In connection with Echelon’s strategic planning process, Echelon management prepared and provided to the Echelon Board various forward-
looking financial information for fiscal years 2018 through 2022. This financial information was also made available to certain parties considering a
transaction with Echelon, including Adesto, Party B, Party C, Party D and Party E. This financial information is collectively referred to as the
“Management Original Forecasts.”

In connection with the preparation of the fairness opinion by Piper Jaffray, Echelon management updated the Management Original Forecasts
solely to account for the passage of time and Echelon’s business results since the preparation of the Management Original Forecasts. This financial
information is collectively referred to as the “Management Refreshed Forecasts.” Echelon provided the Management Refreshed Forecasts to Piper
Jaffray for use in the preparation of its fairness opinion, but did not make the Management Refreshed Forecasts available to any parties considering a
transaction with Echelon. The Management Original Forecasts and the Management Refreshed Forecasts are collectively referred to as the “Forecasts.”
A summary of the Forecasts is set forth below.

The Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or to complying with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (which we refer to as “GAAP”). In addition, the Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the
SEC or by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information. In addition, the Forecasts assume
that Echelon would continue as a standalone company and do not reflect the impact of the merger (if it is completed).

In the opinion of Echelon management, the Forecasts (1) were prepared on a reasonable basis; (2) reflected the best currently available estimates
and judgments; and (3) presented, to Echelon management’s knowledge, the expected future financial performance of Echelon within the parameters
and under the assumptions specified in preparing the Forecasts. Because the Forecasts reflect estimates and judgments, they are susceptible to
sensitivities and assumptions, as well as multiple interpretations based on actual experience and business developments. The Forecasts also cover
multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year.

Neither Echelon’s independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent accountants have (1) compiled, reviewed, audited,
examined or performed any procedures with respect to the Forecasts; (2) expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or
the achievability of such information; or (3) assumed any responsibility for the Forecasts. Echelon’s independent registered public accounting firm
disclaims any association with the Forecasts.

The Forecasts are forward-looking statements. Although the Forecasts are presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions
and estimates as to future events made by Echelon management

Table of Contents

that Echelon management believed were reasonable at the time that the Forecasts were prepared, taking into account the relevant information available
to Echelon management at that time. However, the Forecasts are not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results.
Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Forecasts not to be achieved include, among others, (1) general economic conditions;
(2) the accuracy of certain accounting assumptions; (3) changes in actual or projected cash flows; (4) competitive pressures; and (5) changes in tax laws.
Additional factors that may impact Echelon and its business can be found in the various risk factors included in Echelon’s periodic filings with the SEC.
All of these factors are difficult to predict, and many of them are outside of Echelon’s control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Forecasts
will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Forecasts. The Forecasts may differ from publicized
analyst estimates and forecasts and do not take into account any events or circumstances after the date that they were prepared, including the
announcement of the merger. Echelon does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date
they were made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even if any or all of the assumptions underlying the Forecasts are shown to be in
error or no longer appropriate.

By including the Forecasts in this proxy statement, neither Echelon nor any of its representatives has made or makes any representation to any
person regarding Echelon’s ultimate performance as compared to the information contained in the Forecasts. The inclusion of the Forecasts should not
be regarded as an indication that the Echelon Board, Echelon or any other recipient of the Forecasts considered, or now considers, the Forecasts to be
predictive of actual future results. Further, the inclusion of the Forecasts in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by
Echelon that the information presented is material. The summary of the Forecasts is not being included in this proxy statement to influence the decision
of any Echelon stockholder on how to vote at the special meeting.

Echelon stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Forecasts, as Echelon may not achieve the Forecasts whether or not
the merger is completed.

Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Echelon Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be
aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Echelon stockholders
generally, as more fully described below. The Echelon Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time,
among other matters, in approving the merger agreement and the merger and recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by Echelon’s
stockholders.

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance.”

Treatment of Equity-Based Awards

Treatment of Company Options

As of the record date, there were 336,140 outstanding company options held by our directors and executive officers, of which 192,000 have an
exercise price below the per share merger consideration.

At the effective time of the merger, each company option outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the option consideration.
The payment of the option consideration will be subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

With respect to any company options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such company options is equal to or greater than the per
share merger consideration, such company options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in exchange for such cancellation.

Treatment of Company RSUs

As of the record date, there were 414,269 outstanding RSUs (including performance-based RSUs) held by our directors and executive officers.

At the effective time of the merger, each company RSU outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether vested or
unvested, will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the RSU consideration. For the purposes of
the previous sentence, the number of shares of Echelon common stock issuable pursuant to a company RSU will be deemed to be the number of shares
issuable following full performance and satisfaction of the target (to the extent applicable). The payment of the RSU consideration will be subject to any
applicable withholding taxes.

Equity Interests of Echelon’s Executive Officers and Non-Employee Directors

The following table sets forth for each Echelon executive officer and director, as of August 31, 2018, (1) the number of shares of common stock
held assumed to be held based on information available to Echelon as of the date of this proxy statement; (2) the number of shares subject to outstanding
company options with an exercise price less than $8.50 per share; and (3) the number of shares subject to company RSUs that will vest upon the merger,
assuming that Echelon does not provide vesting terms for any executive officer that are different from those described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.” The

Payments Upon Termination Following Change of Control

CEO Employment Agreement

We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Sege effective August 19, 2010. Under Mr. Sege’s employment agreement, if he is subject to
an Involuntary Termination (as defined in the employment agreement) within 3 months prior to or within 12 months following a Change in Control
Merger (as defined in the employment agreement), then subject to his execution of a release of claims in favor of Echelon that subsequently becomes
effective, he would be entitled to receive: (1) a lump sum payment, less applicable withholdings, equal to 18 months of his then-current base salary;
(2) a lump sum payment, less applicable withholdings, equal to 150% of the greater of (i) the average annual bonus paid over the prior 24-month period
or (ii) his then-current target annual bonus; (3) 100% vesting acceleration of outstanding and unvested service-based equity awards; (4) 100% vesting
acceleration at on-target levels of all equity awards with performance-based vesting in which the performance period has not yet lapsed; (5) Echelon’s
payment of premiums for continued health, dental and vision benefits for him (and any eligible dependents) under Echelon’s health, dental and vision
plans for up to 18 months; and (6) any bonuses earned before his termination but deferred solely due to Echelon policy will be paid out at the earliest
time that would not give rise to additional taxation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

In addition, the employment agreement provides that, if any payment or benefits to Mr. Sege (including the payments and benefits under his
employment agreement) would constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and would therefore
be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits will be either (1) reduced to the largest
portion of the payments and benefits that would result in no portion of the payments and benefits being subject to the excise tax; or (2) not reduced,
whichever, after taking into account all applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the excise tax (all computed at the
highest marginal rate), results in his receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater payments and benefits.

The closing of the merger will constitute a “Change in Control Merger” under Mr. Sege’s employment agreement.

Under the employment agreement, the following definitions are used:
 

 

•  “Involuntary Termination” means (1) without Mr. Sege’s express written consent, a significant reduction of his duties, authority or
responsibilities immediately prior to such reduction; (2) a material reduction in his total cash compensation (other than pursuant to partial or
no annual bonus payouts due to failure to achieve the performance milestones); (3) his relocation to a facility or a location more than
30 miles from his then-present location, without his express written consent; or (iv) any purported termination of Mr. Sege which is not
effected for disability, his death or for Cause (as defined in the employment agreement), or any purported termination for which the grounds
relied upon are not valid. In addition, for (1), (2) or (3) above to qualify as an Involuntary Termination, Mr. Sege must provide written notice
to Echelon of the existence of the one or more of the above conditions within 90 days of its initial existence and Echelon must be provided
with at least 30 days to remedy the condition.

 

 
•  “Cause” means (1) any act of personal dishonesty taken by Mr. Sege in connection with his responsibilities under the employment

agreement and intended to result in his substantial personal

enrichment, (2) his conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony, (3) a willful act by him which constitutes gross misconduct and
which is injurious to Echelon or its affiliates, and (4) following delivery to him of a written demand for performance from Echelon which
describes the basis for Echelon’s belief that he has not substantially performed his duties, his continued violations of his obligations to
Echelon which are demonstrably willful and deliberate on his part.

Executive Change in Control and Severance Agreements with Other Named Executive Officers

Echelon entered into executive change in control and severance agreements (which we refer to as the “severance agreements”) with Alicia Jayne
Moore, Senior Vice President, Chief Legal and Administration Officer and Secretary, and Christopher Jodoin, Senior Vice President Operations and
Planning. Each of these agreements provides that if the named executive officer’s employment with Echelon terminates pursuant to a CIC Involuntary
Termination (as defined in the severance agreement) and such termination occurs on or within 12 months after a Change in Control Merger (as defined
in the applicable severance agreement), he or she would be entitled to receive: (1) a lump-sum payment, less applicable withholdings, equal to 12
months of his or her annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to his or her termination date or, if greater, at the highest level in effect during the
one year period immediately before the Change in Control Merger; and (2) a taxable monthly payment, less applicable withholdings, equal to twice the
monthly COBRA premium (based on the premium for the first month of COBRA coverage) that would be required to continue group health, dental and
vision coverage (as in effect on the date of termination) for the applicable named executive officer and his or her spouse and covered dependents for 12
months.

In addition, each severance agreement provides that, if any payment or benefits to the applicable named executive officer (including the payments
and benefits under his or her severance agreement) would constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue
Code and would therefore be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits will be either
(1) reduced to the largest portion of the payments and benefits that would result in no portion of the payments and benefits being subject to the excise
tax; or (2) not reduced, whichever, after taking into account all applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the excise tax
(all computed at the highest marginal rate), results in his or her receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater payments and benefits.

The closing of the merger will constitute a “Change in Control Merger” under each severance agreement.

Under each severance agreement, the following definitions are used:
 

 

•  “CIC Involuntary Termination” means, without the named executive officer’s express written consent: (1) a significant reduction of his or
her duties, authority or responsibilities, relative to his or her duties, authority or responsibilities at the highest level as in effect during the
three-month period immediately prior to the Change in Control Merger; (2) a material reduction in his or her total cash compensation at the
highest rate in effect during the three-month period immediately prior to the Change in Control Merger; (3) his or her relocation to a facility
or a location more than 30 miles from his or her then-present location, without his or her express written consent; or (4) any purported
termination of the named executive officer which is not effected for his or her death, disability or for Cause (as defined in his or her
severance agreement) or any purported termination for which the grounds relied upon are not valid.

 

 

•  “Cause” means (1) any act of personal dishonesty taken by the named executive officer in connection with his or her responsibilities as a
service provider and intended to result in his or her substantial personal enrichment; (2) his or her conviction of a felony; (3) a willful act by
him or her which constitutes gross misconduct and which is injurious to the successor corporation; and (4) following delivery to him or her
of a written demand for performance from the successor corporation which describes the basis for the successor corporation’s belief that he
or she has not substantially performed his or her duties, his or her continued violations of his or her obligations to the successor corporation
which are demonstrably willful and deliberate on his or her part.

Golden Parachute Compensation

The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K published by the SEC regarding certain compensation
that each of Echelon’s named executive officers may receive that is based on, or that otherwise relates to, the merger. Echelon’s “named executive
officers” for purposes of the disclosure in this proxy statement are Messrs. Sege and Jodoin and Ms. Moore. For additional details regarding the terms of
the payments quantified below, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards” and “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—
Payments Upon Termination Following Change of Control.”

The figures in the table are estimated based on (1) assumed compensation and benefit levels as of August 31, 2018; (2) an assumed effective date
of August 31, 2018, for the merger; and (3) the assumed termination of the named executive officer’s employment without cause on the day immediately
following such effective date for the merger. The amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named executive officer in connection with the merger
may differ from the amounts set below.

Echelon’s named executive officers will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation, or tax reimbursement in connection with the
merger.

As required by applicable SEC rules, all amounts below that are determined using the per share value of Echelon’s common stock have been
calculated based on the per share merger consideration.

(1) These amounts represent the “double-trigger” cash severance payments to which Mr. Sege may become entitled under his employment agreement and the “double-

trigger” cash severance payments to which each of Ms. Moore and Mr. Jodoin may become entitled under his or her severance agreement, as described in further
detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon
Termination Following Change of Control.” The amounts represent (1) the lump sum cash payment of the applicable number of months of the named executive
officer’s base salary (18 months for Mr. Sege and 12 months for each of Ms. Moore and Mr. Jodoin); (2) in Mr. Sege’s case, the lump sum cash payment equal to
150% of the greater of (i) the average annual bonus paid over the prior 24-month period or (ii) his then current target annual bonus (which, for purposes of this table,
is assumed to be 150% of his most-recent target annual bonus since Mr. Sege’s annual bonus opportunity for 2018 was replaced with the grant of performance
shares and the amount of the annual bonus opportunity he otherwise would have had is greater than the average annual bonus paid to him over the 24-month period
before his assumed termination date); and (3) in the case of Ms. Moore and Mr. Jodoin, the taxable monthly cash payment equal to twice the monthly COBRA
premium (based on the premium for the first month of COBRA coverage) that would be required to continue group health, dental and vision coverage (as in effect
on the date of termination) for the applicable named executive officer and his or her spouse and covered dependents for 12 months, as follows:

(2) These amounts include the “single-trigger” payments of the option consideration and RSU consideration for the portions of unvested company options and company
RSUs, respectively, that are otherwise scheduled to vest by their terms after August 31, 2018, as described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.” The following table
quantifies the value of such payments, which is calculated for each such equity award by multiplying (1) the number of shares subject to such equity award (which,
for a company RSU, will be deemed the number of shares issuable following full performance and satisfaction of the target (to the extent applicable)) by (2) the
difference between the per share merger consideration and the exercise price per share, if any, attributable to such equity award.

(3) If Mr. Sege is subject to an Involuntary Termination (as defined in his employment agreement) that is not for cause within 3 months prior to the closing of the

merger, then pursuant to his employment agreement, he will receive 100% vesting acceleration of his outstanding service-based equity awards and 100% vesting
acceleration at on-target levels of all equity awards with performance-based vesting in which the performance period has not yet lapsed, and he will receive “double-
trigger” payments of the option consideration and RSU consideration for the portions of unvested company options and company RSUs, respectively, that are
otherwise scheduled to vest by their terms after his termination, instead of the “single-trigger” payments described above. The amount of such “double-trigger”
payments may be greater than the amount of such “single-trigger” payments, depending on when such termination of Mr. Sege’s employment occurs.

(4) These amounts represent the “double-trigger” non-cash benefit of Echelon’s payment of the cost of COBRA continuation coverage to which Mr. Sege may become
entitled under his employment agreement (as described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Termination Following Change of Control”) upon the assumed termination of his employment
without cause on the day immediately following the effective date for the merger.

(5) As noted above, Mr. Sege’s employment agreement and the severance agreements with Ms. Moore and Mr. Jodoin each provide that in the event that any payment
or benefit provided to the applicable named executive officer would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (as a result
of a payment or benefit being classified as a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code), then such named executive officer will receive
such payment as would entitle him or her to receive the greatest after-tax benefit, even if it means Echelon paying him or her a lower aggregate payment so as to
minimize or eliminate the potential excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. Based on the assumptions used in preparing this table, it is
not expected that any of the named executive officers will be subject to such a reduction (to avoid the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal
Revenue Code). However, the actual value of the named executive officers’ payments and benefits for purposes of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code may
vary depending on factors such as the actual closing date of the merger, in which case it is possible that the named executive officers may have their payments or
benefits so reduced in connection with the merger under the terms of Mr. Sege’s employment agreement or the severance agreements with Ms. Moore and
Mr. Jodoin, as applicable.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

The closing of the merger will take place (1) on a date to be agreed upon by Adesto, Merger Sub and Echelon that is no later than the third
business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the Merger Agreement) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the closing
conditions of the merger (described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the
Merger”), other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such
conditions; or (2) at such other time agreed to in writing by Echelon, Adesto and Merger Sub. On the closing date, the parties will file a certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing and
acceptance of such certificate of merger, or at a later time agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.

Appraisal Rights

If the merger is consummated, Echelon stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who properly demand an
appraisal of their shares, who continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger, who otherwise comply with the procedures of
Section 262 of the DGCL and who do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal will, subject to the conditions thereof, be
entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL (which we refer to as “Section 262”). Unless the
context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262 and in this summary to a “stockholder” are to a record holder of Echelon common stock.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by
the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The following
summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that Echelon stockholders exercise their appraisal
rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal of the shares registered in that holder’s
name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person, such as a bank, broker or other
nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to demand an appraisal of such holder’s shares. If you hold your shares of our common stock
through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other
nominee to ensure that appraisal rights are exercised.

Under Section 262, if the merger is completed, holders of record of shares of common stock who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholder’s shares to Echelon prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement; (3) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective time of the merger; and (4) otherwise comply with the
procedures and satisfy certain ownership thresholds set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown) interest on the amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to be fair value from the effective date of the merger through the
date of payment of the judgment at a rate of 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during
the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment (except that, if at any time before the entry of judgment in
the proceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will accrue thereafter only upon the
sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and
(ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a
hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal rights will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Echelon stockholders who asserted appraisal
rights unless (1) the total number of shares of common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Echelon’s common stock as
measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 or (2) the value of the merger consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We
refer to these conditions as the “ownership thresholds.” Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause
shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at
5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period (except that, if at any time
before the entry of judgment in the proceeding, the surviving corporation pays to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, interest will
accrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and (ii) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time). The surviving corporation is under no obligation to make
such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.

Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days
prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders of record as of the

record date for notice of such meeting that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes
Echelon’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who
wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a
timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be
entitled to receive the merger consideration described in the merger agreement without interest. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures
for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, Echelon believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, that
stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the following:
 

 •  the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement;
 

 •  the stockholder must deliver to Echelon a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger agreement at the special meeting;
 

 
•  the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a

stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time of the merger); and
 

 

•  a stockholder (or any person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf
of such person) or the surviving corporation must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value
of the stock of all such stockholders within 120 days after the effective time of the merger. The surviving corporation is under no obligation
to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

In addition, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery, at a hearing to determine stockholders entitled to appraisal
rights, will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Echelon stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless one of the ownership thresholds is met.

Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, an
Echelon stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement, abstain or
not vote his, her or its shares.

Filing Written Demand

A stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Echelon, before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special
meeting at which the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A stockholder exercising
appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record
through the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written
demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing
instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against
the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will, in and of itself,
constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and
separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not

constitute a demand. A stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the
special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s name. A demand
for appraisal in respect of shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform Echelon of
the identity of the holder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand an appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. If the shares are owned of record
in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner,
and if such shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on
behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on
behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent
is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.

STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN “STREET NAME” BY A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE AND
WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, AS
APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A
DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE
NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER, TRUST OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE
RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Echelon Corporation
2901 Patrick Henry Drive

Santa Clara, CA 95054
Attention: Corporate Secretary

At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger, any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for
appraisal and accept the per share merger consideration offered pursuant to the merger agreement, without interest, by delivering to Echelon, as the
surviving corporation, a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days
after the effective time of the merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding
in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval
may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not affect the right of any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for
appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective time of the merger. If Echelon, as the surviving corporation, does not
approve a request to withdraw a demand for appraisal when that approval is required, or, except with respect to any stockholder who withdraws such
stockholder’s demand in accordance with the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not approve the
dismissal of an appraisal proceeding with respect to a stockholder, the stockholder will be entitled to receive only the appraised value determined in any
such appraisal proceeding, which value could be less than, equal to or more than the per share merger consideration being offered pursuant to the merger
agreement.

Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of shares of common stock who
has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 (or the beneficial owner of such shares) may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a
stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all dissenting stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation
is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and stockholders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a
petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of common stock
who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock
within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify a
previous written demand for appraisal.

Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with the requirements for an
appraisal of such holder’s shares pursuant to Section 262 will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement
setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which Echelon has received
demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to the requesting
stockholder within 10 days after receipt by the surviving corporation of the written request for such a statement or within 10 days after the expiration of
the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares of common stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the
foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.

If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation, the
surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list
containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached. The Delaware Court of Chancery may order that notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition be
given to the surviving corporation, and all of the stockholders shown on the verified list at the addresses stated therein. Any such notice shall also be
given by one or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of
Wilmington, Delaware or any other publication which the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The costs of any such notice are borne by the
surviving corporation.

After notice to dissenting stockholders as required by the court, at the hearing on such petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the
stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery may
require the stockholders who demanded appraisal for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder.

The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Echelon stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (a) the total
number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and

perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of Echelon’s common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 or (b) the
value of the merger consideration in respect of the shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.

Determination of Fair Value

After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, and that at least one of the ownership
thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the Echelon stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such
proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will determine the “fair value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising
from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise
for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will
accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective
date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. The surviving corporation has the right, at any time prior to the Delaware Court of
Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder seeking appraisal. If the surviving corporation
makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (i) the difference, if any,
between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery and (ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. In Weinberger v UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court
of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any
techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered,
and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated
that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation.
Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In
Cede & Co. v Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known
elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger,
the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof
as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and
that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion
as to, and may not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Echelon believes that the per share merger
consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same
as, the per share merger consideration. Neither Echelon nor Adesto anticipates offering more than the per share merger consideration to any
stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of Echelon and Adesto reserves the rights to make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection
(h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair value” of a share of common stock is less than
the per share merger consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in
respect of the Echelon stockholders seeking appraisal rights,

then the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts)
may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any
stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or validly
withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the
merger into the right to receive the per share merger consideration as provided in the merger agreement. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively
lose, such holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership
thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the Echelon stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving
corporation a written withdrawal of such holder’s demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share merger consideration as provided in the
merger agreement in accordance with Section 262.

From and after the effective time of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of common
stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to
stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal is filed within
the time provided in Section 262, or if such stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an
appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of the
surviving corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the
Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon
such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.

Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder’s statutory appraisal rights. In
that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration for your dissenting shares in accordance with the merger agreement.
Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

Accounting Treatment

The merger will be accounted for as a “purchase transaction” for financial accounting purposes.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to U.S. Holders and
Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger.
This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated
under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (which we refer to as the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities,
all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This
discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment purposes).

Table of Contents

This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their
particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
 

 

•  tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as
financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations, partnerships and any other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or
pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and shareholders, partners or investors in such entities; insurance companies;
mutual funds; dealers in stocks and securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their
securities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; holders who hold
their common stock as “qualified small business stock” for purposes of Sections 1045 and 1202 of the Code; or certain former citizens or
long-term residents of the United States;

 

 
•  tax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reduction

transaction;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction or pursuant to the exercise of options

or warrants;
 

 •  tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch thereof, located,

organized or resident outside the United States;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who are “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” or “personal holding

companies” for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 •  tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the shares of

common stock being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in the Code);
 

 •  the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;
 

 •  any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences; or
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares under Section 262 of

the DGCL.

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a
beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner
and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors
regarding the consequences of the merger.

No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger described below. If the IRS
contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final determination by a court.

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO
ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES
ARISING UNDER FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING
JURISDICTION.

Table of Contents

U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 

 •  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the

United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 •  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 

 
•  a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons

as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as
a United States person.

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that
such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s
holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the completion of the merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to
long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder
acquired different blocks of shares of common stock at different times and different prices, such holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding
period separately with respect to each block of our common stock.

Non-U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor
a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 

 

•  the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), in which case such
gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a
corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax
treaty);

 

 
•  such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition, and

certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent (or a
lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or

 

 

•  We are or have been a “United States real property holding corporation” (which we refer to as a “USRPHC”), as such term is defined in
Section 897(c) of the Code, at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding
period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock (which we refer to as the “relevant period”), and, if shares of common stock
are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns
directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more than 5 percent of our common stock at any time during the relevant period, in
which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S.

persons (as described in the first bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. We believe that we are not, and have
not been, a USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 24%) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the merger.
Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such U.S.
Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder that (1) provides a
certification of such Non-U.S. Holder’s non-U.S. status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) otherwise
establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

No regulatory or governmental approvals or filings are required for consummating the merger, other than the filings or notices required under the
federal securities laws and the rules of Nasdaq and the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger

On July 20, 2018, and July 26, 2018, putative class action lawsuits were filed by purported stockholders of Echelon in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California and in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (which we refer to as the “lawsuits”).
The lawsuits are captioned Aducci v. Echelon Corporation, et al., No. 5:18-cv-4415 (N.D. Cal.) and Rosenblatt v. Echelon Corporation, et al., No. 1:18-
cv-01103-UNA (D. Del.). The lawsuits assert claims under Section 14 (a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the disclosures
contained in the preliminary proxy statement that Echelon filed with the SEC on July 16, 2018. The suits name Echelon and its directors as defendants.
The complaints seek a variety of equitable and injunctive relief including, among other things, enjoining the consummation of the merger and awarding
the plaintiffs costs and attorneys’ fees. Echelon management believes that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit, and the defendants intend to defend
the lawsuits vigorously.

PROPOSAL 2: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting. If stockholders approve this proposal, we can
adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including
soliciting proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly signed proxies voting against adoption of the merger agreement. Among
other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against
adoption of the merger agreement such that the proposal to adopt the merger agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the special meeting
without a vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement. Additionally, we may seek stockholder approval to adjourn the special meeting if a quorum is not present, and the
chairperson of the special meeting may also adjourn the special meeting for such purpose even if the stockholders have not approved the proposal to
adjourn the special meeting.

The Echelon Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF CERTAIN MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS ON A NON-
BINDING, ADVISORY BASIS

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,
requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote on the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation.”

We are asking stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Echelon to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers of in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes. The
various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made generally have previously formed part of Echelon’s
overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the
Compensation Committee of the Echelon Board, which is composed solely of non-employee directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with
marketplace norms.

Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Echelon approve the compensation that will or may become payable to Echelon’s named executive officers
in connection with the merger on a non-binding, advisory basis as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The
Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” in Echelon’s proxy statement for the
special meeting.”

Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and as a non-binding, advisory vote, the result will not
be binding on Echelon, the Echelon Board or Adesto. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms,
subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated our named executive officers
will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms and conditions
applicable to those payments.

The Echelon Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

Table of Contents

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger agreement in this summary and
elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached
to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully
and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and
obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement, and not by this summary or any other information contained
in this proxy statement.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement (1) were made only for
purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement; (3) may be
subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by Echelon, Adesto and Merger Sub in connection with
negotiating the terms of the merger agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally
applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Adesto and Merger Sub by
Echelon in connection with the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for
the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Echelon, Adesto and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to
standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the representations and warranties were
negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right not to consummate
the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in circumstance or otherwise. Echelon
stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Echelon, Adesto or Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date
of the merger agreement and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included in this proxy
statement. None of the representations and warranties will survive the closing of the merger, and, therefore, they will have no legal effect under the
merger agreement after the effective time. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the
respective businesses of Echelon, Adesto and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the
confidential disclosure letters to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior
notice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and
conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding Echelon, Adesto, Merger Sub or their respective businesses.
Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the merger agreement should not be read alone, and you should read
the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Echelon and our business.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

The closing of the merger will take place on (1) a date to be agreed upon by Adesto, Merger Sub and Echelon that is no later than the third
business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under the Merger Agreement) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the closing
conditions of the merger (described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the

Table of Contents

Effects of the Merger; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers

The merger agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
effective time of the merger, (1) Merger Sub will be merged with and into Echelon; (2) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and
(3) Echelon will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of Adesto. At the effective time of the merger, all of
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Echelon and Merger Sub will vest in the surviving corporation, and all of the debts, claims,
liabilities, obligations and duties of Echelon and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the surviving corporation.

At the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation of Echelon as the surviving corporation will be amended and restated in its
entirety to read as set forth in an exhibit to the merger agreement, and the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger, will be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth in an exhibit to the merger agreement will become the bylaws of the
surviving corporation, until thereafter amended or restated.

The parties will take all necessary actions so that at the effective time of the merger, the board of directors of the surviving corporation will consist
of the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The parties will take all
necessary action so that at the effective time of the merger, the officers of Echelon as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the
officers of the surviving corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation until
their successors are duly appointed.

Conversion of Shares

Common Stock

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than shares (1) held by Echelon as treasury stock; (2) owned
by Adesto or Merger Sub; (3) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Echelon, Adesto or Merger Sub; or (4) owned by each
Echelon stockholder who has properly made a demand for appraisal under Delaware law and has neither effectively withdrawn, failed to perfect, waived
or otherwise lost such stockholder’s right to appraisal will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
$8.50 per share, without interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding taxes (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit (and if required, bond) in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement).

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock that is (1) held by Echelon or (2) owned by Adesto or Merger Sub, or
their respective direct or indirect subsidiaries, will be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

Equity Awards

The merger agreement provides that Echelon’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be
subject to the following treatment at the effective time of the merger:

Company Options

At the effective time of the merger, each company option outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
whether vested or unvested, will, be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the option
consideration. The payment of the option consideration will be subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

Table of Contents

With respect to any company options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such company options is equal to or greater than the per
share merger consideration, such company options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in exchange for such cancellation.

Company RSUs

At the effective time of the merger, each company RSU outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whether vested or
unvested, will be cancelled and converted into a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the RSU consideration. For the purposes of
the previous sentence, the number of shares of Echelon common stock issuable pursuant to a company RSU will be deemed to be the number of shares
issuable following full performance and satisfaction of the target (to the extent applicable). The payment of the RSU consideration will be subject to any
applicable withholding taxes.

Payment Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures

Prior to the closing of the merger, Adesto will select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Echelon (which we refer to as the “payment
agent”) to make payments of the merger consideration to Echelon stockholders. At or prior to the closing of the merger, Adesto will deposit (or cause to
be deposited) with the payment agent cash that is sufficient in the aggregate to pay the aggregate per share merger consideration to Echelon stockholders
in accordance with the merger agreement.

Promptly (and in any event within five business days) following the effective time of the merger, the payment agent will mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented
outstanding shares of Echelon common stock (subject to certain exceptions) whose shares of Echelon common stock were converted into the right to
receive the consideration payable in respect thereof under the merger agreement; a letter of transmittal; and instructions advising stockholders how to
surrender stock certificates in exchange for the per share merger consideration. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates for cancellation (or an
appropriate affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, together with any required bond); and (2) a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal
and such other documents as may be reasonably required in accordance with such material and instructions, the holder of such certificate will be entitled
to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares represented by such certificate and (ii) the per share merger consideration in
exchange therefor. The amount of any per share merger consideration paid to Echelon stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any
applicable withholding taxes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of shares of Echelon common stock held in book-entry form (which we refer to as “uncertificated
shares”) will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal (as both are described above) to the payment agent to receive the
consideration payable in respect thereof. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger) of
uncertificated shares that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented an outstanding share of Echelon common stock (subject to
certain exceptions) will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form at the effective time of the merger, be entitled to receive, and the
payment agent will pay and deliver as promptly as practicable, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of uncertificated shares held by
such stockholder; and (2) the per share merger consideration. The amount of consideration paid to such Echelon stockholders will not include interest
and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes.

If any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within one year following the effective time of the merger, such cash will be returned
to Adesto upon demand, and any Echelon stockholders as of immediately prior to the merger who have not complied with the exchange procedures in
the merger agreement will thereafter look only to Adesto for satisfaction of their claims for payment (subject to abandoned property law, escheat law or
similar law). None of Adesto, Merger Sub, Echelon, the surviving corporation or the payment agent will be liable to any Echelon stockholder with
respect to any cash amounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar law.

Table of Contents

The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has been stolen or destroyed. In
the event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then the payment agent will issue the per share merger consideration to such
holder upon the making by such holder of an affidavit for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate. Adesto or the payment agent may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the payment of the per share merger consideration, require such stockholder to deliver a bond in such amount as Adesto
or the payment agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Adesto, the surviving corporation or the payment agent with
respect to such certificate.

Representations and Warranties

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of Echelon, Adesto and Merger Sub.

Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement made by Echelon are qualified as to “materiality” or “Company Material
Adverse Effect.” For purposes of the merger agreement, “Company Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to Echelon, any change, event,
violation, inaccuracy, effect or circumstance (each of which we refer to as an “Effect”) that, individually or taken together with all other Effects that
exist or have occurred prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the Company Material Adverse Effect, (1) has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of Echelon and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
or (2) would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the merger, except that, solely with respect
to clause (1) above, none of the following (by itself or when aggregated) will be deemed to be or constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or will
be taken into account when determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may, would or could occur:
 

 

•  changes in general economic conditions in the United States or any other country or region in the world, or changes in conditions in the
global economy generally (except to the extent that such Effect has had a disproportionate adverse effect on Echelon relative to other
companies of a similar size operating in the industries in which Echelon and its subsidiaries conduct business, in which case only the
incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into account in determining whether there has occurred a Company Material
Adverse Effect);

 

 

•  changes in conditions in the financial markets, credit markets or capital markets in the United States or any other country or region in the
world, including (1) changes in interest rates or credit ratings in the United States or any other country; (2) changes in exchange rates for the

any securities exchange or over-the-counter market operating in the United States or any other country or region in the world (except, in
each case, to the extent that such Effect has had a disproportionate adverse effect on Echelon relative to other companies of a similar size
operating in the industries in which the Echelon and its subsidiaries conduct business, in which case only the incremental disproportionate
adverse impact may be taken into account in determining whether there has occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect);

 

 

•  changes in conditions in the industries in which Echelon and its subsidiaries conduct business (except to the extent that such Effect has had a
disproportionate adverse effect on Echelon relative to other companies of a similar size operating in the industries in which Echelon and its
subsidiaries conduct business, in which case only the incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into account in determining
whether there has occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect);

 

 

•  changes in regulatory, legislative or political conditions in the United States or any other country or region in the world (except to the extent
that such Effect has had a disproportionate adverse effect on Echelon relative to other companies of similar size operating in the industries in
which Echelon and its subsidiaries conduct business, in which case only the incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into
account in determining whether there has occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect);

adverse impact may be taken into account in determining whether there has occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect);

Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred);

No Solicitation of Other Offers

Under the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger (or the earlier termination of the merger
agreement), Echelon has agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations with, and terminate any data room (or
other access to diligence) of, any person and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors relating to an
acquisition transaction and to request that any person (other than Adesto and its representatives) who executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with its consideration of acquiring Echelon to promptly return or destroy all non-public information furnished by or on behalf of Echelon or its
subsidiaries prior to the date of the merger agreement.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger (or the earlier termination
of the merger agreement), Echelon and its subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and executive officers will not, and Echelon will not
authorize or direct any of its or its subsidiaries’ employees, consultants or other representatives to, directly or indirectly:
 

 
•  solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal

that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal (as defined below);
 

 
•  furnish to any person (other than Adesto, Merger Sub or any of their respective designees) any non-public information relating to Echelon or

designees), in any such case in connection with any acquisition proposal or with the intent to induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an acquisition proposal or the making of any proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

 

 
•  participate, or engage in discussions or negotiations, with any person with respect to an acquisition proposal or with respect to any inquiries

from third parties relating to the making of, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal;
 

 •  approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal;
 

 •  enter into an alternative acquisition agreement (as defined below); or
 

 •  authorize or commit to do any of the above.

Notwithstanding these restrictions, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Echelon stockholders, Echelon and the Echelon Board (or a
committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their representatives, following the execution of an acceptable confidentiality
agreement: (1) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with; (2) furnish any non-public information relating to Echelon or any of its
subsidiaries to; or (3) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Echelon or
any of its subsidiaries to, in each case, any person or its representatives that has made or delivered to Echelon a written acquisition proposal that was not
solicited in breach of the non-solicitation restrictions above, but only if the Echelon Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (i) such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal (as defined
below) or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal; and (ii) the failure to do so would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. In connection with the foregoing, Echelon will (1) provide written notice to Adesto immediately following
the Echelon Board’s determination referred to in the prior sentence; and (2) substantially contemporaneously make available to Adesto any non-public
information concerning Echelon and its subsidiaries that is provided to any such person or its representatives that was not previously made available to
Adesto.

If Echelon, its subsidiaries or its or their representatives receives an acquisition proposal (as defined below), an inquiry from any person related to
making a potential acquisition proposal or any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with Echelon or its representatives at any time prior to the earlier to occur of the termination of the merger agreement and the effective time of
the merger, Echelon must promptly (and in all events by the later of 24 hours from the receipt thereof) advise Adesto of such acquisition proposal or
request, including the identity of the person making such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and the material terms and conditions thereof (including
copies of any written documentation setting forth such terms). Thereafter, Echelon must keep Adesto reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the
status and terms of any such offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement:
 

 
•  an “acquisition proposal” is any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Adesto or Merger Sub) relating to an acquisition

transaction;
 

 •  an “acquisition transaction” is any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the merger) involving any:
 

 
•  direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or “group” (as defined in the Exchange Act) of persons, whether from

Echelon or any other person, of securities representing more than 15% of the total outstanding voting power of Echelon after giving
effect to the

consummation of such purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any person or “group”
of persons that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such person or “group” of persons beneficially owning
more than 15% of the total outstanding voting power of Echelon after giving effect to the consummation of such tender offer or
exchange offer;

 

 

•  direct or indirect purchase (including by way of a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution or other transaction), exclusive license or other acquisition by any person or “group” of persons of assets
(including equity securities of any subsidiary of Echelon) constituting or accounting for more than 15% of the revenue, net income
or consolidated assets of Echelon and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or

 

 

•  merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction involving
Echelon or any of its subsidiaries whose business accounts for more than 15% of the revenue, net income or consolidated assets of
Echelon and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, where the stockholders of Echelon (or such subsidiary) prior to the transaction will
not own, directly or indirectly, at least 85% of the surviving company;

 

 
•  a “alternative acquisition agreement” is any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or

other contract relating to an acquisition transaction; and
 

 

•  a “superior proposal” is a written acquisition proposal (substituting 50% for 15% and 85% in the definition of “acquisition proposal” above)
for an acquisition transaction on terms that the Echelon Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) would be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Echelon stockholders (in their
capacity as such) than the merger (taking into account (1) any revisions to the merger agreement made or proposed in writing by Adesto
prior to the time of such determination; and (2) those other factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Echelon Board (or any
committee thereof), including the identity of the person making the proposal, the likelihood of consummation in accordance with the terms
of such proposal, and the legal, financial (including financing terms), regulatory, timing and other aspects of such proposal).

The Echelon Board’s Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change

The Echelon Board has recommended that the holders of shares of common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. The
merger agreement provides that the Echelon Board will not effect a company board recommendation change except as described below.

Except as set forth below, at no time after the date of the merger agreement may the Echelon Board or a committee thereof (with any action
described in the following (other than the final list item) being referred to as a “company board recommendation change”):
 

 
•  withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Echelon Board’s

recommendation in a manner adverse to Adesto;
 

 •  adopt, approve, or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, an acquisition proposal;
 

 
•  fail to publicly reaffirm the Echelon Board’s recommendation within 10 business days of the occurrence of a material event or development,

or of any public disclosure regarding any acquisition proposal, and after Adesto so requests in writing (or if the special meeting is scheduled
to be held within 10 business days, then within one business day after Adesto so requests in writing);

 

 
•  take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than

a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the Echelon Board (or a committee thereof) to Echelon’s
stockholders pursuant to

Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Echelon
Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an acquisition proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on
the 10th business day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such acquisition proposal without such
action being considered a violation of the merger agreement); or

 

 •  fail to include the Echelon Board’s recommendation in this proxy statement.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by stockholders, the Echelon Board may, upon
compliance with the procedures described below, effect a company board recommendation change (1) in response to an intervening event (as defined
below) other than in connection with a written acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior proposal; or (2) if Echelon has received a bona fide written
acquisition proposal that the Echelon Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal, in each case, if the Echelon Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that a failure to effect a company board recommendation change would be inconsistent with the
Echelon Board’s fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.

The Echelon Board may effect a company board recommendation change, but may not terminate the merger agreement, in response to an
intervening event if and only if:
 

 
•  Echelon has provided prior written notice to Adesto at least four business days in advance to the effect that the Echelon Board (or a

committee thereof) has (1) made the determination described above; and (2) resolved to effect a company board recommendation change
pursuant to the merger agreement, which notice must describe the applicable intervening event in reasonable detail; and

 

 

•  prior to effecting such company board recommendation change, Echelon and its representatives, during such four business day period, have
(1) negotiated with Adesto and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Adesto desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that the Echelon Board (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to make a company board recommendation change in
response to such intervening event would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; and
(2) permitted Adesto and its representatives to make a presentation to the Echelon Board regarding the merger agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Adesto requests to make such a presentation).

In addition, the Echelon Board may effect a company board recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement to enter into an
alternative acquisition agreement in response to a written acquisition proposal that the Echelon Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal if and only if:
 

 
•  the Echelon Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal

counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;
 

 
•  Echelon has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to the merger agreement with respect to such acquisition

proposal;
 

 

•  Echelon has provided prior written notice to Adesto at least four business days in advance to the effect that the Echelon Board (or a
committee thereof) has (1) received a written acquisition proposal that has not been withdrawn; (2) concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal; and
(3) resolved to effect a company board recommendation change or to terminate the merger agreement, which notice will describe the basis
for such company board recommendation change or termination, including the

identity of the person or “group” of persons making such acquisition proposal, the material terms of such acquisition proposal and copies of
all relevant documents relating to such acquisition proposal; and

 

 

•  prior to effecting such company board recommendation change or termination, Echelon and its representatives, during the four business day
notice period described above, have (1) negotiated with Adesto and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Adesto desires to so
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that such acquisition proposal would cease to
constitute a superior proposal; and (2) permitted Adesto and its representatives to make a presentation to the Echelon Board regarding the
merger agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Adesto requests to make such a presentation).

In the event of any material revision, amendment, update or supplement to any such acquisition proposal described above, Echelon has also agreed
to deliver a new written notice to Adesto and to comply with the above procedures with respect to such new written notice (with the notice period being
two business days from the date of such notice) and no company board recommendation change or termination will be permitted by Echelon unless, at
the end of such two day notice period, the Echelon Board (or a committee thereof) has in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) reaffirmed its determination that such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, an “intervening event” means any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, effect or
circumstance, or any material consequence thereof, that (1) as of the date of the merger agreement was not known to Echelon and was not reasonably
foreseeable to the Echelon Board as of the date of merger agreement; and (2) does not relate to (i) an acquisition proposal or inquiry that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal; or (ii) the fact, in and of itself, that Echelon meets or exceeds any internal or published
projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or after the date of
the merger agreement.

Stockholder Meeting

Echelon has agreed to take all action necessary to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the special meeting as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of this proxy statement, provided, that the special meeting is not required to be held at any
time prior to the 20th business day following the mailing of this proxy statement. Echelon is permitted to postpone or adjourn the special meeting in
certain circumstances related to soliciting additional proxies or requirements of applicable law.

Employee Benefits

From and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will (and Adesto will cause the surviving corporation to) honor all of the
Echelon benefit plans and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the effective time
of the merger. However, except as provided in the following paragraph, nothing will prohibit the surviving corporation from amending or terminating
any such Echelon benefit plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to
applicable law.

For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger and with respect to the continuing employees employed within that period,
(1) the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Adesto will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the
benefit of each continuing employee the company plans on terms and conditions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect at
Echelon or its subsidiaries on the date of the merger agreement, and provide benefits to each continuing employee pursuant to such company plans;
(ii) provide benefits to each continuing employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Adesto benefit plans; or
(iii) provide some combination of

company plans and Adesto benefit plans such that each continuing employee receives benefits that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the
aggregate to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Adesto; (2) Adesto or its subsidiaries shall provide continuing employees with
severance benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Adesto or its affiliates; and
(3) neither Adesto nor its subsidiaries shall reduce the aggregate cash compensation, including base salary and target incentive compensation
opportunity, payable to any continuing employee.

To the extent that a company plan or Adesto benefit plan is made available to any continuing employee at or after the effective time of the merger,
the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Adesto will cause the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such
continuing employee credit for all service with Echelon and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (1) each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in
any and all new plans to the extent that coverage pursuant to any such new plan replaces coverage pursuant to an old plan; (2) for purposes of each new
plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits to any continuing employee, the surviving corporation will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such new plan to be waived for such continuing employee and his or her
covered dependents, and the surviving corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such continuing
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the old plan ending on the date that such continuing employee’s
participation in the corresponding new plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such new plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-
payments, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new plan; and (3) credit the accounts of such continuing employees
pursuant to any new plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such continuing employee. Any vacation or paid
time off accrued but unused by a continuing employee as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be credited to such continuing
employee following the effective time of the merger, will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals.

Efforts to Close the Merger

General

Under the merger agreement, Adesto, Merger Sub and Echelon agreed to use reasonable best efforts to: (1) take, or cause to be taken, all actions;
(2) do, or cause to be done, all things; and (3) assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, or causing to be done, all things, in each case as are
necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to applicable law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the merger, including using their reasonable
best efforts to: (1) cause the conditions to the closing of the merger described below to be satisfied; (2) seek to obtain all consents, waivers, approvals,
orders and authorizations from governmental authorities; and (3) with respect to Echelon, if requested by, and in consultation with Adesto and Merger
Sub, seek to obtain all consents, waivers and approvals, and deliver all notifications pursuant to any material contracts in connection with the merger
agreement.

Financing Cooperation

Adesto has agreed to use its reasonable best effort to obtain the financing necessary to consummate the merger. Echelon has agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts, and will cause its subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by
Adesto or Merger Sub to assist them in obtaining the necessary financing, including, among other things, using reasonable best efforts to:
 

 
•  make senior management and advisors of Echelon available to participate in a reasonable and limited number of meetings, presentations,

road shows, due diligence sessions and drafting sessions;
 

 
•  assist Adesto or any underwriter, placement agent or other financing sources or prospective financing sources with the timely preparation of

offering and related documents in connection with the financing;
 

 
•  solely with respect to financial information and data derived from Echelon’s historical books and records, assist Adesto with the preparation

of pro forma financial information and pro forma financial statements;
 

 
•  if Adesto pursues any debt financing, assist Adesto in connection with the preparation of any pledge and security documents and other

definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Adesto or the financing sources and otherwise reasonably facilitate the
pledging of collateral and the granting of security interests in respect of the financing;

 

 
•  use reasonable best efforts to obtain, to the extent applicable, consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the

financing and accountants’ comfort letters, in each case as reasonably requested by Adesto;
 

 
•  furnish Adesto and Merger Sub and any other financing source, as promptly as practicable after written request by Adesto, with all

necessary financial statements, financial data, audit reports and other reasonably available information regarding Echelon and its
subsidiaries;

 

 
•  deliver notices of prepayment within the time periods required by the relevant agreements governing indebtedness and obtaining customary

payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at the closing of the merger, and give any other necessary
notices, in each case to allow for the payoff, discharge and termination in full at the closing of the merger of all indebtedness;

 

 •  provide reasonable and customary cooperation with any marketing efforts of Adesto for the financing; and
 

 
•  take all corporate and other actions, subject to the occurrence of the closing of the merger, reasonably requested by Adesto to permit the

consummation of the financing.

The obligations of Adesto and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are not conditioned on obtaining financing.

Indemnification and Insurance

The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Adesto will cause the surviving corporation and its
subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill the obligations of Echelon and its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements that have been provided to
Adesto between Echelon and any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or officers (and any person
who becomes a director or officer of Echelon or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger), on the other hand (which we refer to as
the “indemnified persons”).

In addition, the merger agreement provides that, during the six year period commencing at the effective time of the merger, the surviving
corporation will (and Adesto will cause the surviving corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each indemnified person, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, from and against all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims,

damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any legal proceeding to the extent arising, directly or indirectly,
out of or pertaining, directly or indirectly, to (1) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such indemnified person’s capacity as a
director, officer or agent of Echelon or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or
omission, occurred prior to, at or after the effective time of the merger); and (2) the merger, as well as any actions taken by Echelon, Adesto or Merger
Sub with respect thereto. Subject to certain terms and conditions, the merger agreement also provides that, in the event of any such legal proceeding, the
surviving corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by any such indemnified
person in the defense of such legal proceeding.

In addition, without limiting the foregoing but subject to the immediately forthcoming sentence, the merger agreement requires Adesto to cause
the surviving corporation to maintain in effect Echelon’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policies in respect of acts or omission occurring at or prior to
the effective time, on terms that are equivalent to those currently in effect for a period of at least six years commencing at the effective time of the
merger. The surviving corporation is not required to pay premiums for such policy to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by Echelon, and if the premium for such insurance coverage would exceed such amount, the surviving corporation will be obligated to
obtain the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. In lieu of the foregoing, prior to the effective time of the merger, Echelon
may purchase (or, if Adesto requests, Echelon will purchase) a prepaid “tail” policy so long as the annual cost for such “tail” policy does not exceed
300% of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid)

The merger agreement also provides that the indemnified parties are third party beneficiaries of the indemnification and insurance provisions in
the merger agreement and are entitled to enforce such provisions.

For more information, refer to the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of Echelon’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger.”

Transaction Litigation

Echelon will (1) provide Adesto with prompt notice of all stockholder litigation relating to the merger agreement (including by providing copies

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after the adoption of the merger
agreement by Echelon stockholders (except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement), in the following ways:
 

 •  by mutual written agreement of Echelon and Adesto;
 

 •  by either Echelon or Adesto if:
 

 

•  (1) any permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory
restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the merger is in effect, or any action taken by a governmental authority of
competent jurisdiction prohibiting, making illegal or enjoining the consummation of the merger has become final and non-
appealable; or (2) any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation or order prohibiting, making illegal or enjoining the consummation of
the merger has been enacted, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the merger;

 

 

•  the merger has not been consummated before 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on the termination date, provided that a party may not
terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision if such party’s action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger
agreement and is the primary cause of, or has primarily resulted in, the failure to satisfy the conditions to the closing of the merger or
the failure to consummate the merger by the termination date; or

 

 
•  Echelon stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting (except that a party may not terminate the merger

agreement pursuant to this provision if such party’s action or failure to act constitutes a breach of the merger agreement and is the
primary cause of, or has primarily resulted in, the failure to obtain the approval of the Echelon stockholders at the special meeting);

 

 •  by Echelon if:
 

 
•  after a 20-day cure period, Adesto or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its respective

representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement, such that the related closing condition would
not be satisfied;

 

 

•  prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Echelon stockholders, (1) Echelon has received a superior proposal; (2) the Echelon
Board (or a committee thereof) has authorized Echelon to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement to consummate the
acquisition transaction contemplated by such superior proposal; (3) Echelon pays or causes to be paid to Adesto a $1.54 million
termination fee; and (4) Echelon has complied with its non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement with respect to such
superior proposal; or

 

 

•  (1) all of the conditions applicable to Adesto, Merger Sub and Echelon’s obligations to close the merger have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, each of which is then capable
of being satisfied); (2) Echelon has delivered an irrevocable written notice to Adesto at least three business days prior to such
determination that it is ready, willing and able to close the merger; (3) at all times during such three business day period, Echelon
stood ready, willing and able to consummate the merger, and (4) Adesto has failed to close the merger by the end of such three
business day period; provided that Echelon is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement for the foregoing prior to the later of
three business days after the adoption of the merger agreement by Echelon stockholders or September 15, 2018, which date may be
extended to September 30, 2018, in certain circumstances;

 •  by Adesto if:
 

 
•  after a 20-day cure period, Echelon has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties,

covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement, such that the related closing condition would not be satisfied; or
 

 •  the Echelon Board has effected a company board recommendation change.

In the event that the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination rights above, the merger agreement will be of no further force or
effect without liability of any party to the other parties (or their representatives), as applicable, except certain sections of the merger agreement will
survive the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the merger
agreement will relieve any party from any liability for any willful breach of the merger agreement, nor will any party be relieved from liability for its
fraud. In addition, no termination of the merger agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any party pursuant to the confidentiality agreement
between Echelon and Adesto, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with their
respective terms.

Termination Fees

Echelon has agreed to pay Adesto a termination fee of $1.54 million if the merger agreement is terminated in specified circumstances.

Adesto will be entitled to receive the termination fee from Echelon if:
 

 

•  (1) the merger agreement is validly terminated by (i) either Adesto or Echelon because Echelon stockholders do not adopt the merger
agreement at the special meeting or (ii) Adesto because Echelon has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement (and has not cured such breach or failure to
perform during a cure period), such that the related closing condition would not be satisfied; (2) the conditions applicable to Echelon’s
obligations to close the merger would be satisfied (other than the condition of obtaining the requisite Echelon stockholder vote);
(3) following the date of the merger agreement and prior to its termination under certain circumstances, an acquisition proposal has been
publicly announced or publicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn or otherwise publicly abandoned; and (4) within one year of such
termination of the merger agreement, either an acquisition transaction is consummated or Echelon enters into a definitive agreement
providing for the consummation of an acquisition transaction and such acquisition transaction is subsequently consummated (whether such
consummation occurs before or after the one-year anniversary of such termination) (provided that, for purposes of the termination fee, all
references to “15%” and “85%” in the definition of “acquisition transaction” are deemed to be references to “50%”);

 

 •  the merger agreement is validly terminated by Adesto because the Echelon Board has effected a company board recommendation change; or
 

 
•  the merger agreement is validly terminated by Echelon in order to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with respect to a superior

proposal.

If the merger agreement is validly terminated because (1) the merger is not consummated by the termination date and Echelon stockholders have
not approved the merger; or (2) Echelon fails to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of the merger and the termination fee is not then otherwise
payable by Echelon to Adesto, then within two business days after demand by Adesto, Echelon must pay or cause to be paid to Adesto up to $440,000 of
Adesto’s reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by Adesto and its affiliates on or
prior to the termination of the merger agreement in connection with the merger. In the event that Adesto later becomes entitled to receive the termination
fee, the amount of expenses reimbursed by Adesto will be credited against that fee.

Table of Contents

Upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances, Adesto will be required to pay Echelon a termination fee of $4,410,000.
Echelon will be entitled to receive the termination fee from Adesto if:
 

 

•  the merger agreement is terminated by Echelon if (1) all of the conditions applicable to Adesto, Merger Sub and Echelon’s obligations to
close the merger have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger,
each of which is then capable of being satisfied); (2) Echelon has delivered an irrevocable written notice to Adesto at least three business
days prior to such determination that it is ready, willing and able to close the merger; (3) at all times during such three business day period,
Echelon stood ready, willing and able to consummate the merger, and (4) Adesto has failed to close the merger by the end of such three
business day period; provided that Echelon is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement for the foregoing prior to the later of three
business days after the adoption of the merger agreement by Echelon stockholders or September 15, 2018, which date may be extended to
September 30, 2018, in certain circumstances; or

 

 
•  the merger agreement is terminated by Adesto if the merger has not been consummated before 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on the termination

date, so long as such termination occurs at a time when Echelon is entitled to terminate the merger agreement and receive the termination fee
from Adesto.

Neither Adesto nor Echelon is required to pay to the other its termination fee on more than one occasion.

Adesto’s receipt of the termination fee or the Adesto expenses payable by Echelon to the extent owed is the sole and exclusive remedy of Adesto
and Merger Sub and each of their affiliates. Echelon’s receipt of the termination fee payable by Adesto to the extent owed is the sole and exclusive
remedy of Echelon.

Specific Performance

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Echelon, Merger Sub and Adesto, respectively, are entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of the merger agreement and to enforce the terms of the
merger agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. For the avoidance of doubt, if the merger agreement is
terminated by Echelon and Echelon receives the termination fee from Adesto after Adesto fails to consummate the merger within three business days
despite the satisfaction and waiver of all conditions applicable to Adesto, Merger Sub and Echelon’s obligations to close the merger (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, each of which is then capable of being satisfied), Echelon will not be
entitled to seek or receive specific performance or other equitable relief to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the merger agreement against
Adesto.

Fees and Expenses

Except in specified circumstances, whether or not the merger is completed, Echelon, on the one hand, and Adesto and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, are each responsible for all of their respective costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the merger. Adesto or the
surviving corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the payment agent. Adesto will pay or cause to be paid all (1) transfer, stamp and
documentary taxes or fees; and (2) sales, use, gains, real property transfer and other similar taxes or fees, in each case arising out of or in connection
with the consummation of the merger.

No Third Party Beneficiaries

The merger agreement is binding upon and inures solely to the benefit of each party thereto, and nothing in the merger agreement is intended to or
will confer upon any other person any rights or remedies, except, at and after the effective time (1) benefits to the directors and officers who are
intended to be third-party beneficiaries of certain terms of the merger agreement; and (2) the rights of the holders of shares of common stock, company
stock-based awards or company options to receive merger consideration.

Table of Contents

Amendment and Waiver

Subject to applicable law, the merger agreement may be amended in writing by the parties at any time, whether before or after adoption of the
merger agreement by stockholders. However, after adoption of the merger agreement by stockholders, no amendment that requires further approval by
such stockholders pursuant to the DGCL may be made without such approval.

At any time prior to the effective time, any party may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties in the merger agreement or waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in provisions of the merger agreement (subject to compliance with applicable law). Any agreement by a party to any such
extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. Any delay in exercising any right pursuant to the
merger agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right.

Governing Law; Venue

The merger agreement is governed by Delaware law. The exclusive venue for disputes relating to the merger and the guarantee is the Delaware
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, any state or federal court in the State of Delaware.

Waiver of Jury Trial

Each of the parties irrevocably waived any and all right to trial by jury in any claim, complaint, action or legal proceeding arising out of or relating
to the merger agreement, the merger, or the financing.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

If the merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future meetings of stockholders of
Echelon. However, if the merger is not completed, stockholders will continue to be entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.

Echelon will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2019 only if the merger has not already been completed.

Stockholders who intend to have a proposal considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for presentation at our 2019 annual meeting of
stockholders, if held, pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act must submit the proposal to us no later than December 7, 2018.

Echelon bylaws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to specified matters to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders but
not included in our proxy materials. In general, written notice must be received by Echelon’s SVP, Chief Legal and Administration Officer and Secretary
not less than 20 days nor more than 60 days prior to an annual meeting and must contain specified information concerning the matters to be brought
before such meeting and concerning the stockholder proposing such matters. Therefore, to be presented at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, such
a proposal must be received by our SVP, Chief Legal and Administration Officer and Secretary no earlier than 60 days nor later than 20 days prior to
that meeting. If less than 30 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of that meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the
stockholder, in order to be timely, must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the

interest thereon (the “Per Share Price”), in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.9 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11).

(b) Adjustment to the Per Share Price. The Per Share Price will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or
after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.

(i) Dissenting Company Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who have (A) neither
voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and (B) properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of
appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will
not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that
all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who have failed to perfect or who have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.9.

(ii) Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal. The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

2.8 Equity Awards.

(a) Company RSUs. Parent will not assume any Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each Company RSU outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof,
be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the amount of the Per Share Price by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU (the “Company
RSU Consideration”). For the purposes of the previous sentence, the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to a Company
RSU will be deemed to be the number of shares issuable following full performance and satisfaction of the target (to the extent applicable). The payment
of the Company RSU Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes.

(b) Company Options. Parent will not assume any Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the amount of the Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company

Option) by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option (the “Company Option Consideration”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Company Options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Options is
equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Company Options will be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The
payment of the Company Option Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes.

(c) Payment Procedures. No later than three weeks following the Closing Date, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
applicable holders of Company RSUs and Company Options to receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll
system or payroll provider (including by conducting a special payroll, if necessary), of all amounts required to be paid to such holders with respect to
Company RSUs and Company Options that are cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company RSUs or Company Options pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or Section 2.8(b), as applicable, cannot
be made through the Company’s or the Surviving Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for
such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event more
than 15 Business Days thereafter).

(d) Necessary Further Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the Compensation Committee of
the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.8
(including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act). The Company shall take all actions that are
necessary to ensure that all Company RSUs and all Company Equity Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time.

2.9 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Company, with the Payment Agent.

(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which such holders of shares of Company Common Stock become entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and
any proceeds thereon, the “Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the
Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by
Section 2.7; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the
cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, then Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the
amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level
sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any interest or other income from investment of the Exchange
Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.

(c) Exchange and Payment Procedures.

(i) Certificates. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business Days), Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned
Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.11) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment Agent in accordance with the terms of such
materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for the number of shares represented by such Certificate
(and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price (less
any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof). The Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept
Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the Certificates on the amount payable
upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the Certificates will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.

(ii) Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock held in book-entry form (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Payment Agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company
Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into
the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form (it
being understood that the holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an “agent’s
message” or such other evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent will
cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares by (B) the Per Share Price (less
any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof). The Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will
accept transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the
Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the surrender of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(ii). Until so surrendered,
Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.7(a).

(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and
DTC with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the product

obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares)
held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and
(ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its
nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date.

(e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7 may be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of
the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such
payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer
Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be made to the
Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a Company Stockholder for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on
which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority, then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look
for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price
to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.

2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will
no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously
representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration
payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c)). The consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with
the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

2.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in
exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.12 Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person
such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any applicable Laws relating to Taxes. To the extent that such amounts
are so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

2.13 Future Dividends or Distributions. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a
record date on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

2.14 Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take
all such lawful and necessary action.

reasonably believes that it has provided the information requested by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.5(a)(vi) for any period, it may deliver to Parent a
written notice stating when the Company believes that it completed such delivery therefor, in which case the Company will be deemed to have complied
with this Section 6.5(a)(vi) at such time with respect to such information (assuming that such information provided was accurate), unless Parent in good
faith reasonably believes that the Company has not completed delivery of the information required by this Section 6.5(a)(vi) and, within five Business
Days after its receipt of such notice from the Company, Parent delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with specificity which
information the Company has not delivered) and (y) nothing in clause (x) shall limit Parent’s ability to reasonably request, and the Company’s obligation
to provide pursuant to this Section 6.5(a)(vi), (1) financial data, and other reasonably available information regarding the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries not covered in the notice delivered pursuant to clause (x) or (2) any update of, or supplement to, the information covered by such notice

risk of material damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. In addition, (A) no action, liability
or obligation of the Company, any of the Company

Financing (other than customary representation letters and authorization letters (including with respect to the presence or absence of material non-public

related to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)) that is not contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to the
Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 6.5 will require (1) any Representative of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to deliver any

Representative; (2) the Company Board to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto prior to the Closing; (3) the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to take any action that would conflict with or violate its organizational documents, any applicable Laws or result in, prior to the Closing, a

the Company Subsidiaries to provide any information (a) the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under applicable Law or any agreement
binding on the Company or the Company Subsidiaries; or (b) where access to such information would (i) give rise to a material risk of waiving any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such information; or (ii) violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a
third Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, any Contract to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or

and shall use its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege or contravene any applicable Law or
binding agreement (including, if practicable, by obtaining consent for the disclosure thereof).

(c) Use of Logos. The Company consents to the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries’ logos in connection with the Financing so long as
such logos are used (i) solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Intellectual Property Rights; and (ii) otherwise in a
manner consistent with the other terms and conditions that the Company reasonably imposes.

Representatives will be permitted to disclose such information to the underwriters in the Financing or, if applicable, the Financing Sources (and, in each

judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with their cooperation in arranging the Financing or the
provision of information utilized in connection therewith (including any action taken in accordance with this Section 6.5) and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided specifically for use in connection with the Financing by or on behalf of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries), in each case, except to the extent actually suffered or incurred as a result of willful misconduct or fraud committed by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or, in each case, their respective Representatives, with respect to matters covered by this Section 6.5.

(g) No Exclusive Arrangements. In no event will Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective controlled Affiliates enter into any
Contract prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of financing from providing or seeking to provide
financing or financial advisory services to any Person, in each case in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or in connection with the Merger.

(h) Company Financial Statements.

(i) Interim Financial Statements. If the Closing does not occur prior to August 1, 2018, the Company will deliver to Parent as
promptly as practicable following the closing of the fiscal quarter of the Company ending on June 30, 2018 (but in any event on or prior to August 15,

times as Parent may reasonably request, provide Parent with (A) a statement of the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (as defined in accordance with
GAAP) of (1) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; and (2) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries other than its Foreign Subsidiaries;
(B) its estimated Transaction Expenses; and (C) to the extent otherwise prepared by the Company, an updated forecast of its revenue, gross margin,
operating income and the information set forth in clause (A) for each month through the end of calendar year 2018.

(iii) No Omissions. All information provided under this Section 6.5(h) (other than information provided under Section 6.5(h)(ii)(C))
shall be complete and correct in all material respects and shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading and the Company shall not have been informed by such auditors that it is
required to restate, and the Company shall not have restated, any such information or announced any intention to restate or that such restatement is under
consideration or may be a reasonable possibility.

6.6 Anti-Takeover Laws. The Company and the Company Board will (a) take all actions within their power to ensure that no “anti-takeover” Law
is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b) if any “anti-takeover” Law becomes applicable to the Merger, take all action within their power to
ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or
minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger.

6.7 Access. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur

personnel, assets, liabilities, results of operations and properties as Parent may reasonably request (so long as such financial data is reasonably available
to the Company under, or derivable from, the Company’s current reporting system), except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents
or information; (b) access to such documents or information would waive any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege
applicable to such documents or information, but that the Company shall inform Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld as a result of
the foregoing and shall use its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege (including, if
practicable, by obtaining consent for the disclosure thereof from the applicable third Person); (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or
accelerate the rights pursuant to such Contract, but that the Company shall inform Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld as a result of
the foregoing and shall use its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege (including, if
practicable, by obtaining consent for the disclosure thereof from the applicable third Person); or (d) such documents or information are reasonably
pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand.
Nothing in this Section 6.7 will be construed to require the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to
prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
Section 6.7 will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. Any access to the
properties of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security measures and insurance requirements
and will not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information
obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.7.
All requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.7 must be directed to the Company’s General Counsel or another person designated in writing by the
Company in advance of the Closing.

6.8 Section 16(b) Exemption. The Company will take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the
Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.9 Directors’ and Officers’ Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Indemnified Persons. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects to the extent permitted under applicable Law, the obligations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements that have been provided to Parent between the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or officers (and any person who becomes a director or employee of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”). In addition, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws
and the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the Agreement Date. During such six-year period
or such period in which an Indemnified Person is asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 6.9(b), whichever is longer, such

provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law.

(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.9(a), during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify
and hold harmless, each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or to the same extent that such Indemnified Persons are
indemnified as of the Agreement Date pursuant to applicable Law, the Charter and Bylaws and other organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements that have been provided to Parent between the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or officers, on the other, from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or
compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding
arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified
Person’s capacity as a director, officer or agent of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such
action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time), including the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.9(b) with respect to a Legal
Proceeding commenced or threatened in writing prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. Upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person to repay any amount if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, the Surviving
Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the
defense of any Legal Proceeding with respect to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.9(b), to the extent required by the terms
of, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, the Charter, the Bylaws, the corresponding organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries, and indemnification agreements, in each case in effect as of the Effective Time and that have been provided to Parent. In connection with
such Legal Proceedings, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood
that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Person’s
entitlement to indemnification under this Section 6.9 with respect thereto); (B) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel
but the Surviving Corporation will not be liable to any Indemnified Person for any fees of counsel subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Person
with respect to the same Legal Proceeding, it being understood that (1) the Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ his or her counsel in any
such proceeding such Indemnified Person’s expense; and (2) if (x) the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Person has been previously authorized
by the Surviving Corporation, (y) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Person in the conduct of any such defense, or (z) the Surviving Corporation shall not, in fact, have employed counsel
to assume the defense of such proceeding, then the reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified Person’s counsel shall be at the expense of the
Surviving Corporation; and (C) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior
written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless: (a) such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
includes an unconditional release from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding for each Indemnified Person covered by such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination; or (b) each Indemnified Person covered by such settlement, compromise, consent or termination provides their

consent. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any
applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to
such Indemnified Person, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving
Corporation.

(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the D&O Insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to
those of the D&O Insurance (except that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a carrier with comparable credit ratings to the existing carrier of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the insured). In satisfying its obligations pursuant to
this Section 6.9(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with a comparable credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the D&O Insurance pursuant to this Section 6.9(c), the
Company may (or, if the Parent requests, the Company will) purchase a prepaid “tail” policy (the “Tail Policy”) with respect to the D&O Insurance
from an insurance carrier with a comparable credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance carrier so long as the
annual cost for the Tail Policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company purchases the Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time,
then the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain the Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to
honor its obligations thereunder for so long as the Tail Policy is in full force and effect.

(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each case, proper provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this Section 6.9, unless such successor or assign assumes such obligations by operation of law.

(e) No Impairment; Third Person Beneficiary Rights. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.9 may not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person (and his or her heirs and representatives) who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person.
Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the
Tail Policy are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9, with full rights of enforcement. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and
other persons (and his or her heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to the D&O Insurance or the Tail Policy) pursuant to this
Section 6.9 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the
similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the Agreement Date and provided to Parent; or (iv) applicable Law.

(f) Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this
Section 6.9 will be joint and several.

(g) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and
officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or

indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.9 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

6.10 Employee Matters.

(a) Change of Control Acknowledgement. Parent acknowledges and agrees that a “change of control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning
of each of the Company Benefit Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.

(b) Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) honor all of the Company Benefit Plans and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 6.10(c), nothing will prohibit the Surviving Corporation
from amending or terminating any such Company Benefit Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance with their terms or if
otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.

(c) Employment; Benefits. For a period of one year following the Effective Time and with respect to the Continuing Employees employed
within that period, (i) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either
(A) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Company Benefit Plans and any other employee benefit plans (other than opportunity to
participate in equity-based benefits, severance and, subject to Section 6.10(b), individual employment agreements) of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries (the “Company Plans”) on terms and conditions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those in effect at the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries on the Agreement Date, and provide benefits to each Continuing Employee pursuant to such Company Plans; (B) provide
benefits to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate to those benefits provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Affiliates (“Parent Plans”); or (C) provide some combination of Company Plans and Parent Plans such that each Continuing
Employee receives benefits that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent; (ii) Parent or its Subsidiaries shall provide Continuing Employees with severance benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Affiliates; and (iii) neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries shall reduce the aggregate cash
compensation, including base salary and target incentive compensation opportunity, payable to any Continuing Employee. The Company will consult in
good faith with Parent regarding the content of communications to Company employees regarding the Merger prior to the release of any such
communications.

(d) New Plans. To the extent that a Company Plan or Parent Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to
such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in
any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, the “New
Plans”) to the extent that coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause all waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and

actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and the
Surviving Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payments, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible
spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, will not be subject
to accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals. Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, unless otherwise
requested by Parent no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall terminate all Company Benefit Plans that are intended to
include a Section 401(k) arrangement (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date
that such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated). The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Benefit Plan(s) have been
terminated (effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or any applicable
committee thereof. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review and approval by Parent (the approval of which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that termination of the Company’s 401(k) plan would reasonably be anticipated
to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees, then the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the
amount of such charges or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent prior to the Closing.

(e) No Third Person Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither this Section 6.10 nor
any provisions of this Agreement relating to Company Benefit Plans will be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude
the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject
to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 6.10, require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any third
party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any Company Benefit Plan.

respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

continuing until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and (2) Effective Time, the Company will give

material respect, or of any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Section 7.2(a)
or Section 7.2(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing. No such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the

Financing Termination Date”); provided that if Parent delivers an Extension Election to the Company on the Financing Termination Date in advance
of receipt of the 8.1(i) Officer’s Certificate (and stating that it is delivered in anticipation of potential receipt of an 8.1(i) Officer’s Certificate), such
Extension Election shall be deemed to have been timely delivered as if it had been delivered immediately following receipt of such 8.1(i) Officer’s
Certificate. If Parent makes the Extension Election, then (i) effective as of the Financing Termination Date, (x) the closing conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 (including the requirement to deliver a certificate in accordance with Section 7.2(c)) shall be deemed to have been satisfied or waived by

challenge by any Party; and (ii) the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement until the Extended Financing Termination Date.
Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the event that Parent is (A) able to consummate the Merger and effect the Closing prior to the Extended
Financing Termination Date, then the Termination Notice delivered by the Company shall be automatically, and without any action by the Company,
deemed to be withdrawn (and the Parties shall consummate the Merger (giving effect to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 as of the Financing Termination Date as described in the previous sentence) and effect the Closing); and (B) not able to consummate the
Merger and effect the Closing prior to the Extended Financing Termination Date, then the Termination Notice delivered by the Company shall be
effective as of 12:01 a.m., Pacific time, on the Extended Financing Termination Date and this Agreement shall be deemed to be validly terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(i) as of such time unless the Company has revoked the Termination Notice in writing prior to such time. During the 10 day
period prior to the Financing Termination Date, the Parties shall communicate in good faith regarding their intention to deliver a Termination Notice and
an Extension Election, respectively.

(b) Effect of Termination. Any valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the mutual
written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties in compliance with
Section 8.1. Following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of
any Party (or any equity holder, controlling person, partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other
representative of such Party) to the other Parties, as applicable, except that, and subject in all respects to this Section 8.2, Section 8.3, Section 6.5(e),
Section 6.5(f), Section 6.13, Section 8.3 and Article IX will each survive the termination of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with their
respective terms and conditions. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, nothing in this Agreement will relieve (i) any Party from any liability for any
willful breach of this Agreement; and (ii) the Company or (subject in all respects to this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Section 9.8 (in each case, including
the limitations set forth herein or therein)) Parent or Merger Sub from any liability for its fraud prior to the valid termination of this Agreement (which
liability in the case of each of (i) and (ii) the Parties acknowledge and agree (A) will not necessarily be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs; and (B) in the case of any damages sought by the non-breaching Party, may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the
non-breaching Party). No valid termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement
or the Financing, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective
terms.

8.3 Fees and Expenses.

(a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger will be

termination, the conditions set forth in (x) Section 7.1(b) would have been satisfied or capable of being satisfied and (y) Section 7.3(a) and

this Agreement, either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation

Parent. For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to “15%” and “85%” in the definition of “Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be
references to “50%.”

(ii) Company Board Recommendation Change. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company
must promptly (and in any event within two Business Days following such termination) pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

(iii) Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company must concurrently with
such termination pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

(c) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events.

(d) Parent Expenses. In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to (A) Section 8.1(c) (if, at the time of such termination, the
Company Stockholders Meeting has not been held or if Parent would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)) or
(B) Section 8.1(d) (under circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b)) and (ii) as of the time of
such termination by Parent (or the Company, as applicable), Parent and Merger Sub were not in material breach of their representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, then within two Business Days after demand by Parent, the Company shall pay to Parent up
to $440,000 of Parent’s reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and its
Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the Merger (collectively, the “Parent Expenses”) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent; it being understood that (1) the existence of circumstances that
could require the Company Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i) shall not relieve the
Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.3(d); and (2) the payment by the Company of the Parent Expenses
pursuant to this Section 8.3(d) shall not relieve the Company of any

subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(i) except to the extent indicated in Section 8.3(b)(i).

(e) Parent Termination Fee. If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(i) or by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(c) (at a time when the Company is then entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i)), then Parent must, within two
Business Days of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company or its designee an amount equal to $4,410,000 in cash (the “Parent
Termination Fee”) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Company.

(f) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
Merger and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, (i) if the Company fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and Section 8.3(d) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a
judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(d) or any portion thereof, then the Company will pay or cause to
be paid to Parent the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’ fees) of Parent in
connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the prime rate (as published
in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made) plus 5% through the date that such
payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable Law (the “Applicable Interest Rate”);
and (ii) if Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(e) and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a
Legal Proceeding that results in a judgment against Parent for the amount of the Parent Termination Fee or any portion thereof, then Parent will pay or
cause to be paid to the Company the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys’
fees) of the Company in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the Applicable Interest
Rate.

(g) Sole and Exclusive Remedy.

(i) With Respect to Parent. Parent’s receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or the
Parent Expenses to the extent owed pursuant to Section 8.3(d) will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub and each of their
respective Affiliates against (A) the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates; and (B) the former, current and future

stockholders and assignees of each of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and
(B) collectively, the “Company Related Parties”) in respect of this Agreement and the Merger, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company Related Parties will have any further monetary liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the Merger (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Parties may be entitled to remedies with respect to,
the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(d), as applicable).

(ii) With Respect to the Company. The Company’s receipt of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to
Section 8.3(e) will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the Company Stockholders and their respective Affiliates against (A) Parent,

employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
each of their respective Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “Parent Related Parties”) in respect of this Agreement and the
Merger, including the failure of Parent to obtain the Financing, any breach or default under Section 6.4 or its failure to consummate the Merger and
effect the Closing, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent Related Parties will have

any further liability or obligation (monetary or otherwise) to the Company, the Company Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Merger (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Parties may be

made to this Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without receiving such approval.

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party in this Agreement; and (c) subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained in this Agreement. Any agreement by a Party to
any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay in exercising any right pursuant
to this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right.

Corporation; (b) to any of their respective Affiliates, it being understood that, in each case, such assignment will not impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or otherwise materially impede the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs or
Company Options; or (c) to the extent that Parent incurs alternative financing in accordance with Section 6.4(c), the Financing Sources (or any agent,
trustee or other representative acting on behalf or for the benefit of the Financing Sources) for purposes of creating a security interest in this Agreement
or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Financing. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party will relieve such Party of any of its
obligations under this Agreement.

9.4 Confidentiality. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed the Confidentiality
Agreement, which will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective
Representatives will hold and treat all documents and information concerning the Merger in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

9.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred
to in this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will
(a) not be superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the (i) Effective
Time and (ii) date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

9.6 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section 6.9 and this Section 9.6, the Parties agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies under this Agreement, except (a) as set
forth in or contemplated by Section 6.9; (b) if Parent or Merger Sub wrongfully terminates or willfully breaches this Agreement, then, following the
termination of this Agreement, the Company, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, may seek damages and other relief (including equitable relief)
on behalf of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs and Company Options (which Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree may include damages based on a decrease in share value or lost premium); and (c) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs and Company Options to receive the merger consideration set forth in Article II. The rights granted
pursuant to clause (b) of the second sentence of this Section 9.6 will only be enforceable on behalf of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company RSUs and Company Options by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, as agent for such holders, and it is understood and agreed
that any and all interests in such claims will attach to such shares of the Company Common Stock, Company RSUs or Company Options and
subsequently transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received by the Company with respect to
such claims (net of expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith) may, in the Company’s sole and absolute discretion, be (A) distributed,
in whole or in part, by the Company to such holders as of any date determined by the Company; or (B) retained by the Company for the use and benefit
of the Company in any manner that the Company deems fit.

9.7 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.8 Remedies.

(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this Agreement or by applicable Law on such Party, and the exercise by a
Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

(b) Specific Performance.

(i) Irreparable Damage. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party failing to take such
actions that are required of it by this Agreement in order to consummate the Merger) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement; and (B) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

(ii) No Objections. The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Parties pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right
that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

(iii) Inapplicability of Specific Performance. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(i) and (B) the Parent Termination Fee is paid to the Company
pursuant to Section 8.3(e), then in no event shall the Company be entitled to seek or receive specific performance or other equitable relief to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement against Parent (including the obligation to consummate the Closing or pay the amounts
contemplated by Article II). In such instance, the Parent Termination Fee shall be the Company’s sole and exclusive remedy, as provided by
Section 8.3(g)(ii).

9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware.

9.10 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process
(whether inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger, for and on behalf of itself or
any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this
Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the Merger; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen Court; (d) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this
Agreement or the Merger will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to
plead or

claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Merger in any court other than the Chosen
Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

9.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR THE FINANCING. EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

9.12 Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one
and the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other
Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg
or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic Delivery”), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party
may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

9.13 No Limitation. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given
to both or all such provisions, (a) the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative;
(b) each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect; and (c) nothing
set forth in any provision in this Agreement will (except to the extent expressly stated) in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of
any other provision of this Agreement.

ANNEX B

Fairness Opinion of Piper Jaffray & Co.

June 28, 2018

Board of Directors
Echelon Corporation
2901 Patrick Henry Drive
Santa Clara, CA 95054

Members of the Board of Directors:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
“Company Common Stock”), of Echelon Corporation (the “Company”), of the Merger Consideration (as defined below), pursuant to a draft dated as of
June 28, 2018 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), to be entered into among the Company, Adesto Technologies Corporation (the
“Acquiror”) and Echelon Corporation (“Merger Sub”), a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror. The Agreement provides for, among
other things, the merger (the “Merger”) of the Merger Sub with and into the Company, pursuant to which each outstanding share of Company Common
Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury, owned by the Acquiror or Merger Sub or owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, will be converted into the right to receive $8.50 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). The
terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

In arriving at our opinion, we have: (i) reviewed and analyzed the financial terms of a draft dated June 28, 2018 of the Agreement; (ii) reviewed and
analyzed certain financial and other data with respect to the Company which was publicly available, (iii) reviewed and analyzed certain information,
including financial forecasts, relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of the Company that were publicly available,
as well as those that were furnished to us by the Company; (iv) conducted discussions with members of senior management and representatives of the
Company concerning the matters described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, as well as its business and prospects before and after giving effect to the
Merger; (v) reviewed the current and historical reported prices and trading activity of Company Common Stock and similar information for certain other
companies deemed by us to be comparable to the Company; (vi) compared the financial performance of the Company with that of certain other
publicly-traded companies that we deemed relevant; (vii) reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain business combination
transactions that we deemed relevant and (viii) conducted a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company based on projections for the Company that
were prepared by Company management. In addition, we have conducted such other analyses, examinations and inquiries and considered such other
financial, economic and market criteria as we have deemed necessary in arriving at our opinion.

We have relied upon and assumed, without assuming liability or responsibility for independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all
information that was publicly available or was furnished, or otherwise made available, to us or discussed with or reviewed by us. We have further relied
upon the assurances of the management of the Company that the financial information provided has been prepared on a reasonable basis in accordance
with industry practice, and that they are not aware of any information or facts that would make any information provided to us incomplete or misleading.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the purpose of this opinion, we have assumed that, with respect to financial forecasts, estimates and
other forward-looking information reviewed by us, such information has been reasonably prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the expected future results of operations and financial condition of the
Company. We express no opinion as to any such financial forecasts, estimates or forward-looking information or the assumptions on which they were
based. We have relied, with your consent, on advice of the outside counsel and the independent accountants to the Company, and on the assumptions of
the management of the Company, as to all accounting, legal, tax and financial reporting matters with respect to the Company and the Agreement.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed that the executed Agreement will be in all material respects identical to the last draft reviewed by us. We
have relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that (i) the representations and warranties of all parties to the Agreement and all other
related documents and instruments that are referred to therein are true and correct, (ii) each party to such agreements will fully and timely perform all of
the covenants and agreements required to be performed by such party, (iii) the Merger will be consummated pursuant to the terms of the Agreement
without amendments thereto and (iv) all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied without waiver by any party of any conditions or
obligations thereunder. Additionally, we have assumed that all the necessary regulatory approvals and consents required for the Merger will be obtained
in a manner that will not adversely affect the Company or the contemplated benefits of the Merger.

In arriving at our opinion, we have not performed any appraisals or valuations of any specific assets or liabilities (fixed, contingent or other) of the
Company, and have not been furnished or provided with any such appraisals or valuations, nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company under
any state or federal law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. The analyses performed by us in connection with this opinion were going
concern analyses. We express no opinion regarding the liquidation value of the Company or any other entity. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, we have undertaken no independent analysis of any pending or threatened litigation, regulatory action, possible unasserted claims or other
contingent liabilities, to which the Company or any of its affiliates is a party or may be subject, and at the direction of the Company and with its consent,
our opinion makes no assumption concerning, and therefore does not consider, the possible assertion of claims, outcomes or damages arising out of any
such matters. We have also assumed that neither the Company nor the Acquiror is party to any material pending transaction, including without limitation
any financing, recapitalization, acquisition or merger, divestiture or spin-off, other than the Merger.

This opinion is necessarily based upon the information available to us and facts and circumstances as they exist and are subject to evaluation on the date
hereof; events occurring after the date hereof could materially affect the assumptions used in preparing this opinion. We are not expressing any opinion
herein as to the price at which shares of Company Common Stock may trade following announcement of the Merger or at any future time. We have not
undertaken to reaffirm or revise this opinion or otherwise comment upon any events occurring after the date hereof and do not have any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

We have been engaged by the Company to act as its financial advisor and we will receive a fee from the Company for providing our services, a
significant portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. We will also receive a fee for rendering this opinion. Our opinion fee is
not contingent upon the consummation of the Merger or the conclusions reached in our opinion. The Company has also agreed to indemnify us against
certain liabilities and reimburse us for certain expenses in connection with our services. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our affiliates may
actively trade securities of the Company and the Acquiror for our own account or the account of our customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a
long or short position in such securities. We may also, in the future, provide investment banking and financial advisory services to the Company, the
Acquiror or entities that are affiliated with the Company or the Acquiror, for which we would expect to receive compensation.

Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, Piper Jaffray has adopted policies and procedures to establish and maintain the
independence of Piper Jaffray’s Research Department and personnel. As a result, Piper Jaffray’s research analysts may hold opinions, make statements
or recommendations, and/or publish research reports with respect to the Company and the Merger and other participants in the Merger that differ from
the views of Piper Jaffray’s investment banking personnel.

This opinion is provided to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Merger and is not intended to be and does
not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should act or vote with respect to the Merger or any
other matter. Except with respect to the use of this opinion in connection with the proxy statement relating to the Merger in accordance with our
engagement letter with the Company, this opinion shall not be disclosed, referred to, published or otherwise used (in whole or in part), nor shall any
public references to us be made, without our prior written approval. This opinion has been approved for issuance by the Piper Jaffray Opinion
Committee.

This opinion addresses solely the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Company Common Stock of the proposed Merger Consideration
set forth in the Agreement and does not address any other terms or agreement relating to the Merger or any other terms of the Agreement. We were not
requested to opine as to, and this opinion does not address, the basic business decision to proceed with or effect the Merger, the merits of the Merger
relative to any alternative transaction or business strategy that may be available to the Company, Acquiror’s ability to fund the merger consideration or
any other terms contemplated by the Agreement or the fairness of the Merger to any other class of securities, creditor or other constituency of the
Company. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of compensation to any officer, director or employee of any party to
the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the compensation to be received by holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger or with
respect to the fairness of any such compensation.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and based upon such other factors as we consider relevant, it is our opinion that the Merger Consideration is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than the Acquiror, the Merger Sub and their respective affiliates)
as of the date hereof.

Sincerely,

ANNEX C

Section 262 of the DGCL

§ 262 Appraisal rights [For application of this section, see 79 Del. Laws, c. 72, § 22, 79 Del. Laws, c. 122, § 12 and 80 Del. Laws, c. 265, § 18]

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise
complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant
to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the
circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a
corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a
receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected
pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), §
252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders
entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national
securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares
of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the
surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of
stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251,
252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect
thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or
held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described
in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not
owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be
available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as

practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words
“constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or
series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent
corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the
provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for
notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal
rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent
corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of §
114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking
of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it
reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such
action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the
surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not
voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation
before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or
consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall
include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such
notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of
the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case
of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and
20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder’s
shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation
notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date
of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days
after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this

title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal
rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant
secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each
constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if
the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is
fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied
with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a
petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined
that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger
or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed
to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or
within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later.
Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee
on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall
within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names
and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses
therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by
publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates
to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the
shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange,
the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series

eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or
(3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value
of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if
any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date
of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the
judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so
paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to
trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed
by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to
appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of
holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be
enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of
any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends
or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however,
that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the
surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation,
either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the
Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as
the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding
or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s
